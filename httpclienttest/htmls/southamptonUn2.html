These boards have been designed in-house to enhance student learning and include similar capabilities to Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Once our students have built these boards, they are theirs to keep.

Teams of six are given free reign to apply all of the skills, knowledge and understanding that they have learnt to solve a challenging problem. This involves designing, building, testing and demonstrating a complete electronic system, from scratch, in just three weeks! At the end of the exercise, the students produce videos and presentations to pitch their designs to a judge from industry, who awards prizes to the members of the most impressive team. Each year, we have a different problem specification for the project, which is not revealed to the students until the last minute. Recently, the objective was to build a portable video game system and another year the students built football-playing robots - the theme of this year's exercise is a closely guarded secret!</p><p><a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/ELEC2205">Find out more about Electronic Design</a></p></div><h3>Our Programmes</h3><p>Within the ECS Electronic Engineering degree, there are a number of opportunities to specialise, within both 3 year bachelor degrees and 4 year undergraduate masters degrees.
