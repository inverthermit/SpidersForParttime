   SE801 - Theory and Ethnography in Social AnthropologyI


   
    This module aims to develop the anthropological imagination of master's students, that is, to instill the ability to apprehend theoretical issues and apply them with a critical and informed sense of difference in the human experience.  The module is not a 'history of theory survey; rather, it will proceed by means of a set of longstanding themes in social and cultural anthropology through which different theoretical approaches to the same ethnographic problem or issue have been explored.  The module may be organised around a single theme that has long dominated anthropological discussions (such as the gift, hierarchy and scale, structure and agency etc.) which will be used as a lens through which to view theoretical discussions within social anthropology as well as its appropriations from other disciplines.

   SE806 - Research Methods in Social Anthropology II


   
    Fieldwork is the hallmark of anthropological research. Its style and delivery, as well as the discourses surrounding it, have changed alongside the discipline. In his book Routes, Travel And Translation In The Late Twentieth Century, Clifford (1997) flags two important aspects of fieldwork: first, the formation of intensive interactions and relationships that produce "deep" cultural understanding in settings that can vary in time and location, and, second, a sense of displacement, movement or travel for the fieldworker thus allowing for an objective detached perspective. The ways in which anthropologists strive to interact with people while maintaining objectivity, make research ethics and methodological choices particularly important since their presence in the field has implications on the people whom they study.

   SE831 - Environmental Anthropology


   
    This module introduces some of the main theoretical approaches and some practical applications of the study of environmental anthropology (in particular, the cultural ecology of Steward, the concepts of carrying capacity and limiting factors as used in eco-systematic models, historical and political ecology, and new approaches deriving from post-modern anthropology). It considers some of the main cultural and social aspects of the human-environment interface, such as the relationship between social organisation and ecology; alternative forms of land use and management; the impact of processes of globalization on human interactions with the environment in a number of non-western societies; and the cultural dimension of human adaptation to the environment. The middle section of the module looks at five categories of subsistence strategy and the environments they occur in, foraging and hunting (in arid, arctic and tropical forest ecosystems), fishing (coastal marine environments), pastoralism (in grassland and arid ecosystems), low intensity and high intensity agriculture (in arid, grassland and tropical environments).  For each of these production systems we will also examine a complementary contemporary issue in conservation and/or development. These issues may involve great debates in theory, problems of methodology or issues in applying research results to solve practical problems.  Throughout the module we address methods and problems of applying research in environmental anthropology to related development, conservation and human rights issues, and in particular this year we look at adaptation to climate change among Indigenous peoples.Week 1  Theory and Explanation in Environmental Anthropology: Wildlife TradeWeek 2  Human-Nature Relationships: Cultural EcologyWeek 3  Ecological Anthropology: Complex Adaptive SystemsWeek 4  Historical Ecology: The evolution of Biocultural diversity?Week 5  Political Ecology and Environmental DegradationWeek 6  Discursive Approaches: EnvironmentalismsWeek 7  Foraging societies, hunters, and the bushmeat tradeWeek 8  Fishers, Sea Tenure, and Common Property RightsWeek 9  Pastoralists, Grasslands and Protected AreasWeek 10 Low Intensity Agricultural Systems: Swidden SystemsWeek 11 High Intensity Agricultural Systems, the Green Revolution and GM cropsWeek 12 Climate Change: Studying local knowledge and responses

   SE854 - Lowland South American Anthropology


   
    Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized - an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

   SE859 - Visual Anthropology Theory


   
    This module is a general introduction to visual anthropology. It includes treatment of cross-cultural cognition and symbolic analysis, the contextualisation of the visual within the wider sensorium, the social history of still photography and film relating to ethnographic subjects, the process of ethnographic filmmaking in terms of wider debates related to intersubjectivity, the study of national and regional cinematic traditions (outside Europe and America), the politics and efficacy of indigenous media, the contexts of visual advocacy and activist filmmaking, the nexus of the visual and medical and  the comparative ethnography of television and broader consideration of issues of social representation and political ideology in visual imagery. The module combines empirical ethnographic analysis of these issues with the alternative (complementary) contributions of scholars of visual imagery from a literary and humanistic tradition of interpretation.

   SA806 - Social Science Perspectives on Environmental Issues


   
    This module aims to widen students' knowledge of a variety of topical and/or scientifically important or controversial environmental issues, to encourage students to look at environmental studies from the perspectives of the several social science disciplines (anthropology, law, political science, social policy, and sociology), to make connections between questions stimulated by their own individual disciplinary backgrounds and those raised in the course, and to reflect critically upon the advantages and limitations of the various perspectives. The module covers a variety of topics which are likely to include: the nature of environmental issues; the social construction of risk and the precautionary principle; global warming, climate change and energy policy; the rise of environmental consciousness and environmentalism; food and agriculture; environmental policy and regulation; environmental policy and law; ecotourism; ecology and development; traditional societies and sustainability.

   SE861 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies


   
    The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

   SE862 - The Anthropology of Eating


   
    Students will learn about the significance of food production, trade and consumption in relation to cultural evolution, globalisation, identity and health. The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development. It will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation. Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings. We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

     SE864      - Medical Anthropology


     
      The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

     SE865      - Ethnography of the Pacific


     
      The societies of the Pacific, encompassing the regions of Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia and Australia, have long attracted anthropologists to the diversity of its peoples and the complexity of their social worlds.  From classic studies of kinship, gift exchange and cargo cults to more recent work on the colonial encounter, gendered relations, and discourses of economic development, Pacific ethnography has perennially challenged anthropologists assumptions about the conception and composition of persons and their relationships.  In this module we will combine the close reading of ethnographies from the Pacific with a consideration of the relationship between ethnography and theory for this part of the world.  The Pacific has moved from a locus of early 20th-century research on societies presumed by anthropologists to be isolated and savage, to a fertile ground for considering the complex relationship between colonial and missionary history and the issues faced by Pacific peoples in the current era.

     SE840      - Contemporary Issues in Ethnobotany


     
      This module grows out of the enormous possibilities and challenges presented to ethnobotanists and environmental anthropologists during the twenty-first century: both to the huge potential created by cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural exchange, and to the enormous challenges that emerge as academia becomes increasingly accountable to a wider range of interests, problems and stakeholders amidst today's planetary crisis. It focuses on the multi-dimensional, complex and dynamic aspects of ethnobotanical, ethnoecological and human-environmental relations, with a special emphasis on the complex social roles and responsibilities of the subfields of ethnobotany and environmental anthropology. Drawing on recent articles and case-study materials from a diverse range of disciplines and perspectives, the module seeks to critically assess some of the key contemporary, at times controversial, issues relating to the material, symbolic, ecological, economic, cultural, historical, institutional and political dimensions of human-plant and human-environment relations.Topics covered include:-The multidimensionality of human-plant interactions-Approaches to ethnobiological variability and complexity-Ethnobotany, socio-environmental change and globalisation-Ethnoecology and symbolic ecology-Ethnobotany, ethnoecology and historical ecology-The chemical ecology of human-plant interactions-Plants, profit, property and power-Complexity, resilience and adaptive management-Agrobiodiversity, food and subsistence-Ethnobotany and forest product development-Conservation and environmental governance-Cultural landscapes

     DI875      - Principles and Practice of Ecotourism


     
      The module will introduce the importance of the growing tourism industry to biodiversity conservation, and equip students with the analytical skills and methodologies required to effectively manage ecotourism to natural areas, whether in protected areas, or on private or communal land. The module will cover how to limit environmental damage in the face of increasing numbers of visitors to natural areas and heritage sites. Environmental impacts of nature tourism will be discussed, and students will gain a theoretical and critical understanding of different management tools. Tourism also has major implications for conservation and the economy and this module will explore how to understand tourism from an economics perspective using appropriate logical and empirical analysis. The module will also provide grounding in theoretical and practical issues relevant to community-based nature tourism, by exploring relationships between hosts and guests from cultural and socio-economic perspectives. Students will become familiar with practical tools for successful management of community-based tourism, and will analyse the strengths and weaknesses of community-based tourism as a tool for both conservation and rural development. The emphasis throughout will be on implementing the principles and practice of ecotourism.

      Throughout the terms preceding the initiation of the dissertation module students will be encouraged by their supervisor and the instructors of other modules they take to develop ideas for their dissertation research project. They will also be taught appropriate research methods. A preliminary abstract of the project is due by the end of the first term. Students will then develop this into a research proposal, which is submitted as the fourth essay. This will be edited and presented to the school for feedback during the Student Research Day and then submitted for a final grade at the end of the second term. Students who are then passed on to the dissertation module by the examiners meeting will, on this basis, complete a written plan for their research project with advice from their tutor. This will be assessed by the tutor and by one other member of the post-graduate anthropology teaching staff, and when this is approved the student and his or her tutor will intensively discuss methods of data collection, theoretical models for the analysis of this material, and the use and integration of research methods into both its preparation and its final presentation. The student will then independently work on the thesis over the summer until mid-September when it will be submitted. Throughout this time the student will be able to gain supervision through electronic mail, and wil have the opportunity to attend various workshop sessions on data analysis and writing.

      Protected areas have a long history.  From time immemorial, human communities have conferred special status on sacred sites, set certain areas of land aside as hunting preserves, or reached agreements on the management regime for communal lands. This module aims to review the practice of setting land aside for such activities and managing protected areas. The following topics will form the basis of lectures, seminars and field trip around which the module will be taught: The concept of a protected area; The significance of size in protected area design; International designations of protected areas; Sustainable use of protected areas; Planning and management; Common threats to protected areas; Governance; Sustainable development and protected areas; Economics of protected areas; Management effectiveness evaluation.

     DI871      - International Wildlife Trade - Achieving Sustainability


     
      Wildlife trade and use contributes on the one hand to peoples livelihoods but on the other may threaten species.  Management of such trade relies on a number of multilateral agreements including CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  Such management requires an appropriate policy, legislative, management and scientific framework for its successful implementation at national and international levels.  Details of each these aspects will be examined and students will have the opportunity to examine a number of multilateral organisations as well as legal aspects of eco-labelling and Intellectual property rights. This module will guide students through the steps of implementing a legal framework, from the adoption of national wildlife trade policies, prioritization of species for management intervention, making sustainability findings and providing incentives for conservation through to the multilateral governance structures.  The module will be delivered through combined methods, of lecture, discussion, and practical exercises which will contribute to achievement of the module specific learning outcomes as well as developing key skills. Particular topics will include: Prioritization & management of species endangered by trade and overuse Making sustainability findings (non-detriment) and trade monitoring  Multilateral environment agreements and trade and environment. Ecolabels and intellectual property rights

      This is an optional module intended to demonstrate how theory drawn from genetics, evolutionary and population biology, and small and large-scale ecology, is applied to conservation assessment and management.  The material will therefore build on that taught in the core module Population and Evolutionary Biology which is a prerequisite, and will be further developed in this module via a case study approach.  Students will be shown how this theory is being applied to real-world conservation problems via the research projects of the course lecturers.  Advanced research techniques in genetics, ecology, and population and evolutionary biology, are used to determine conservation priorities and these will be explored in detail.  Examples of how modern research techniques are currently used for conservation management of threatened animals, especially mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, will also be covered in depth.

      Effective biodiversity conservation relies on an understanding of how markets work and also how they fail.  In this module students will be introduced to key economic theories and concepts such as the laws of demand & supply, market competition and economic efficiency, and the market failure paradigm (property rights, public goods, transaction costs and externalities). We will explore the economic causes of biodiversity conflict and loss such as habitat loss and wildlife trade, and using case studies, we will learn how to identify possible solutions using analytical approaches and techniques such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and multi-criteria analysis.
