Course structure


 The MSc in  Infectious Diseases  involves studying for 120 credits of taught modules, as indicated below. The taught component takes place during the autumn and spring terms, while a 60-credit research project take place over the summer months.

The assessment of the course will involve a mixture of practical classes, innovative continuous assessment to gain maximise transferable and professional skills, and examinations.

In addition to traditional scientific laboratory reports, experience is gained in a range of scientific writing styles relevant to future employment, such as literature reviews, patent applications, regulatory documents, and patient information suitable for a non-scientific readership.

   Assessment

  
   Assessment is by examination, coursework and the research project.
  

 
   Programme aims

  
   This programme aims to:

 provide an excellent quality of postgraduate level education in the field of infectious diseases, their biology and treatments
 provide a research-led, inspiring learning environment
 provide a regional postgraduate progression route for the advanced study of diseases that affect a high proportion of the global population
 promote engagement with biological research into infectious diseases and inspire students to pursue scientific careers inside or outside of the laboratory
 develop subject-specific and transferable skills to maximise employment prospects
 promote an understanding of the impact of scientific research on society and the role for scientists in a range of professions.

  

 
   Learning outcomes

  
   Knowledge and understanding

   You gain knowledge and Understanding of:

 principles and application of key techniques in modern molecular bioscience
 molecular, cellular and physiological basis of infectious diseases
 virulence factors associated with infectious diseases
 epidemiology of infectious diseases
 current therapeutic strategies and their application in the treatment of different infectious diseases
 how scientific knowledge is disseminated to different stakeholders: eg, media, policy-makers and public.

  

 
   
   Intellectual skills

   You gain intellectual skills in:

 research skills: how to formulate research questions and hypotheses to address scientific issues
 analytical skills: interpretation of data, marshalling information from published sources, critical evaluation of own research and that of others
 information technology: use of appropriate technology to retrieve, analyse and present scientific information
 statistical evaluation: the use of appropriate statistical analysis methods in handling scientific data.

  

 
   
   Subject-specific skills

   You gain subject-specific skills in:

 experimental skills: how to design experiments to address specific research questions and hypotheses
 practical skills: key techniques in modern molecular biology and their application in molecular bioscience to solve research problems
 data handling: how to record experimental procedures and data appropriately using good laboratory practice
 presentation of scientific research: how to write research articles in an appropriate style in keeping with high impact factor scientific journals, and posters and oral presentation for conferences and symposia
 science writing: how to present scientific information to scientific and non-scientific audiences
 careers: a recognition of career opportunities for scientists outside of the laboratory.

  

 
   
   Transferable skills

   You gain transferable skills in:

 communication: ability to organise information clearly, present information in oral and written form, adapt presentation for different audiences
 reflection: make use of constructive informal feedback from staff and peers and assess own progress to enhance performance and personal skills
 self-motivation and independence: time and workload management in order to meet personal targets and imposed deadlines
 team work: the ability to work both independently and as part of a research group using peer support, diplomacy and collective responsibility.
