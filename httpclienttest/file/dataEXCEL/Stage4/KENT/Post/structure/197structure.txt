Course structure


 The MSc in Drug Design involves studying for 120 credits of taught modules, as indicated below. The taught component takes place during the autumn and spring terms, while a 60-credit research project take place over the summer months.

The programme is taught by staff from the Biosciences, Centre for Molecular Processing and industrial scientists who all have experience of working with the drug industry (both large pharma and biotech).

In additional to traditional scientific laboratory reports, experience is gained in a range of scientific writing styles relevant to future employment.




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules.

   Programme aims

  
   This programme aims to:

 provide students with an academic framework to underpin your career in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology industry or applied translational research in an academic environment
 give you an understanding of the process of academic investigation in a range of academic disciplines relevant to drug design
 provide a stimulating, research-active environment for teaching and learning in which you are supported and motivated to achieve your academic and personal potential
 facilitate a valuable learning experience through a variety of teaching and assessment methods that will promote the assimilation, comprehension, analysis application, synthesis and evaluation of the knowledge base
 give you the experience of undertaking an independent research project or dissertation
 prepare students for further training and employment both in science and non-science based careers by developing transferable and cognitive skills
 develop the qualities needed for employment in situations requiring the exercise of professionalism, independent thought, personal responsibility and decision-making in complex and unpredictable circumstances
 provide access to as wide a range of students as practicable irrespective of race, background, gender or physical disability from both within the UK and from overseas.

  

 
   Learning outcomes

  
   Knowledge and understanding

   You will gain knowledge and understanding of:

 the fundamental principles of modern molecular techniques and technologies used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors and the ability to utilise and interpret and evaluate the data from such techniques and approaches
 working knowledge of the current landscape for the drug discovery and design industrial/academic frameworks
 drug discovery and design, processes, small molecule, protein- and vaccine-based drugs, as applied in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector
 the role of bioscience technologies in drug discovery process
 the role of systems and pathway biology in therapeutic target identification and validation
 current state of the art technologies utilised in the drug design process both in-silico and in-vitro
 the process by which basic scientific knowledge is translated into the industrial workplace
 basic concepts of pharmacology and drug delivery.

  

 
   
   Intellectual skills

   You develop intellectual skills in:

 the critical interpretation of literature and data sources. How to assimilate multiple data streams to reach appropriate conclusions and derive new hypotheses
 how to use information technology to retrieve, analyse and present scientific data to required standards
 research skills for hypothesis-driven science: how to formulate hypotheses and design appropriate experiments to address them, how to undertake such experiments
 how to analyse a problem or question both independently and as part of a group
 the ability to select and use appropriate statistical methodology to analyse and present scientific data
 the ability to rationally argue a case and use the available evidence to support claims
 the ability to plan and discuss experiments on a collaborative basis to include data from outside your areas of expertise.

  

 
   
   Subject-specific skills

   You gain subject-specific skills in:

 the design of experiments in a statistically valid way to address specific hypotheses and research questions
 appropriate data handing, recording, analysis and how to assess this in line with the current literature
 practical competence in methods utilised in early stage discovery
 how to present scientific research via oral presentation and poster formats
 understanding the drug discovery process in the changing landscape and balance of academic/industrial research for drug discovery and design
 an ability to work independently in a scientific environment and to reach an independent conclusion
 recognition of career opportunities both within academia and industry.

  

 
   
   Transferable skills

   You will gain the following transferable skills:

 the ability to plan and manage workloads
 self-discipline and initiative
 the development of reflective learning practices to make constructive use of your own assessment of performance and use that of colleagues, staff and others to enhance performance and progress
 communication: the ability to organise information clearly, create and respond to textual and visual sources (eg images, graphs, tables), present information orally, adapt your style for different audiences.
 enhanced understanding of group work dynamics and how to work as part of a group or independently.
