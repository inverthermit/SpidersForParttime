Course structure


 Teaching is based on guided study using an online learning environment (Moodle),  videoed expert lectures, online seminars, 'serious games', acted and filmed role play, as well as web-based  weekly forums.

During the programme you:

 develop innovative techniques for professional training and support
 translate and apply the latest research and knowledge to inform best practice
 create diverse and flexible learning programmes
 address gaps in post-qualification training provision and opportunities
 facilitate safe and realistic environments in which child protection professionals can develop and enhance their skills and professional practice.


We also offer two modules by distance learning over a ten-week period:
&bull;       Direct Work with Children
&bull;       New Perspectives on Assessment.

The modules can be taken on their own or as a taster to Master's-level study. All the work is completed online where you participate in online forums and have access to journal articles and specialist materials. After successful completion of the assignment, the module is equivalent to 20 credits at Master&rsquo;s level. For further information, see our website: www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/ccp
