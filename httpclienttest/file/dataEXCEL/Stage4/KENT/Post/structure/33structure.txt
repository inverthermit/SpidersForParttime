Course structure


All research students have a supervisory committee, which is led by a main supervisor who oversees the day-to-day administration and management of the project. The committee also includes a chair, and, if necessary, a supplementary member (often based in the country where the research is conducted).

In conjunction with the supervisory committee, an individual training programme is devised for each student that includes both the generic and specific skills required to undertake the programme of research.
