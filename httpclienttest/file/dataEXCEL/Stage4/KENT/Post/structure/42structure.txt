Course structure


 This programme offers theoretical and practical support for those embarking on a career in HE. It considers different approaches to teaching and learning, grounded in educational research, and related aspects such as curriculum design and delivery and the principles and purposes of assessment. It enables you to bring these considerations to bear on your own work and experience as a teacher, researcher or practitioner.

The emphasis throughout is on developing an understanding of the HE context, recognising the diversity of provision &ndash; universities, Further Education institutions, specialist institutions, professional providers &ndash; and practices, for example, in different disciplinary fields.
