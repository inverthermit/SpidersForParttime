   HI878 - Methods and Interpretations of Historical Research


   
    This course investigates the nature of historical research at its highest level. While postgraduate students are expected to become highly specialised researchers in their own particular field or subfield, this course encourages them to consider history as a wider discipline and to broaden their approach to evidence and interpretation. Students will be expected to engage with a variety of intellectual viewpoints and methodological approaches to the discipline, and consider the impact that other disciplines have had on the study of History. A number of dissertation workshops will be arranged to help students with their dissertations.Part I: ParadigmsHistoricism: the emergence of historical science in the 19th centuryStructural history: the challenge of the social sciencesCultural turns: history after the end of the master narrativePart II: FieldsReligious historyOral history Military historyPropaganda studies Environmental history History of medicinePart III: Portfolio and Dissertation workshops Book reviewsAnnotated bibliographies and historiographical reviewsDissertation outlinesIn addition, we will undertake field trips to archives and research libraries.

   HI915 - Landscapes of the Great War: Interpretations and Representations


   
    This module will explore the way in which different academic disciplines have dealt with the three main overarching experiences of the Great War  mobilisation, attrition and endurance and remobilisation. Each week students will be exposed to the differing interpretations and will explore the major differences between them. The agreed historical facts are therefore the starting point; the harnessing and meanings is the terminus. The module convenor will be present in all sessions chairing them and facilitating the dialogue with the contributing academics. Where possible it is expected that each seminar will have multiple academic contributors. Each section will consist of a tripartite format  week one sets up the following week in special collections with the final week being reflections on what was examined in special collections and interpreted according to the approaches of different academic disciplines.

   HI866 - Science and Medicine in Context


   
    There is no better way to understand how scientific knowledge is made and consumed today than to look at how this happened in the past.  Our examples come from 400 years ago up to the present day, and highlight how changes in the media of knowledge have shaped our understanding of science  printing presses, public lectures, museums and TV. How have audience needs and interests changed during this time, and how has the medium affected the message?  Themes and Topics The printing press and the scientific revolution Cabinets of curiosity: the first museums? Science on display in the 18th century Science and the steam-driven press in the 19th century Science and film in the 20th century Science wars and the public understanding of science in the late 20th century

   HI828 - Ireland and the First World War


   
    The module will examine the experience of Ireland during the First World War. There is now considerable historiography available on Irish recruitment to the British armed forces between 1914 and 1918 and this will form the basis for three seminars; considering Nationalist and Unionist reactions to recruitment and the place of Ireland within wider UK recruitment. Political developments, caused largely by the war, namely, the decline of the Irish Parliamentary Party, rise of the Sinn Fein movement and Irish Unionisms acceptance of partition will form another important element of the module. There has been considerable work carried out on commemoration of the Great War in Ireland and Irish commemoration overseas (most notably the building of the Ulster Tower at Thiepval, France in 1921 and of the Irish Peace Park at Messines / Mesen, Belgium in 1998) and this will form the focus for two seminars. Other seminars will consider the Irish economy and the war and Irish paramilitarism between 1914 and 1918.

   HI874 - Religion and Society in Seventeenth-Century  England


   
     Religion has often been regarded as the motor for change and upheaval in 17th century England: it has been seen as the prime cause of civil war, the inspiration for the godly rule of Oliver Cromwell and the Saints, and central to the Glorious Revolution of 1688-9. Fears of popery, it has been suggested, helped forge English national identify. This module reflects critically on these claims. It explores tensions within English Protestantism, which led to an intense struggle for supremacy within the English Church in the early 17th century, to be followed in the 1640s and 1650s by the fragmentation of Puritanism into numerous competing sects which generated a remarkable proliferation of radical ideas on religion and society. The Restoration of Church and King in 1660 saw the gradual and contested emergence of a dissenting community and the partial triumph of religious tolerance, with profound implications for English society and culture. Another key theme is the changing fortunes of Anglicanism, with its erosion of its position from a national Church to the established Church over the century. The marginal position of English Catholics in 17th century England, albeit with a genuine possibility of significant recovery of rights and influence under James II, is also crucial. The module will address issues of theology, the close relationship between political power and religious change, and the nature of debates on religion at national and local level, and also track elements of continuity and change over a formative century in English religious experience.

   CP807 - Diaspora and Exile


   
    The ubiquity of the term diaspora in recent critical debates has been interpreted as the symptom of a shift in perspective in cultural and social studies. This is reflected in the growing significance of diaspora studies which, to some extent, has superseded postcolonial studies as a theoretical framework in explaining those global phenomena in society, culture and literature which are informed by conceptions of the nation state but cannot sufficiently be explained by them. At the same time, tendencies of universalising conceptions of diaspora as they have recently proliferated and the increasingly simplifying and historically undifferentiated usage of the term need to be reconsidered. Among the various paradigms from which diasporic writing should be distinguished is the literature of exile. Exile is often the consequence of political pressure or disaffection with a society rather than the result of the larger and often spatially and chronologically extended migratory movements which led to the emergence of diasporic communities. While both paradigms may intersect, the concerns and motivations of diasporic and exilic literatures usually differ. A historically and culturally significant geographical, and frequently also imaginary, point of intersection between the diasporic and the exilic paradigms is the metropolis of Paris. In this module, our comparative focus will be on diasporic and exilic literatures and on the significance of the diasporic or exilic space of the French metropolis, both as production context and as informing literary production. Arguably, the most famous group of exiles to choose Paris as their temporary home was the generation of American expatriate writers in the 1920s for whom, as J. Gerald Kennedy suggests, Paris inescapably reflect[ed] the creation of an exilic self  Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Djuna Barnes or, after the Second World War, Richard Wright, James Baldwin and Alexander Trocchi or Boris Vian. Other writers of note who, in different times and under different conditions, chose exile in Paris include Heinrich Heine, Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke, Samuel Beckett, Heinrich Mann or Anna Seghers, Miguel &Aacute;ngel Asturias, Czeslaw Milosz, Milan Kundera, Jorge Sempr&uacute;n and Marjane Satrapi or Julio Cort&aacute;zar, Severo Sarduy, Vargas Llosa, Alfredo Bryce Echenique, Laura Alcoba, Assia Djebar, Nancy Houston and Leila Sebbar. Incorporating aesthetic dimensions, our seminars will explore in particular the extent to which experiences of diaspora and exile inform the work of alien writers residing in Paris.

   FR820 - Paris: Reality and Representation


   
    The curriculum includes a selection of texts from various countries, all readily available in English and all specifically relevant to the modern history, evolving population and changing appearance of Paris and to how these aspects of the city has been perceived and represented in literary prose. The set texts are by writers from different periods and of various nationalities and they are all set in and inspired by Paris. The texts are chosen for their high literary quality, but also because they represent essential aspects of the citys evolution and exemplify various narrative strategies and ways of engaging with the realities of life in the city, always shaped by personal preoccupations and sensibilities. This varied selection within the genre of prose fiction allows study of Zolas naturalism and his presentation of the political and aesthetic implications of baron Haussmans plans for urban renewal and control; Edith Whartons perspective as an American incomer; Andr&eacute; Bretons combination of oneiric urban encounters with photographic illustrations of the city, inserted into the text; Jean Rhyss clearly gendered experience of the city in the 1920s and 1930s; the identity of the city as a site for postwar liberation and literary dynamism in the work of expatriates from the Beat generation; and the representation of todays city as a centre for immigrant communities and cultural diversity. The primary texts are thus all Paris-focussed but are chosen to open an international perspective on the literary representation of an increasingly cosmopolitan city.

   FI815 - Film and Modernity


   
    This module explores the history of film in France, with a particular focus on the role and representation of Paris in cinema of the pre-World War II years. The module examines the medium of film, considering its specific qualities as an art-form and also the ways in which it is influenced by and influences other artistic and cultural forms from its beginnings in the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the establishment of the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que in the wake of World War II. Each week we will be considering the other artistic forms that were being produced at the same time as the films that are the focus of discussions. Simultaneously, the module will expose the intimate relationship between the development of the modern city and the development of the cinema, with a particular focus on Paris and the ramifications of its modernisation. The module specifically seeks to assess the historical place of the cinema within the development of early twentieth- century culture in Paris. To this end our reading will range from the work of early French film theorists, through critical theorists, geographers, urban planners and cultural historians.

     HI826      - Literary Undergrounds and Anarchists in the Basement


     
      Paris as a city witnessed enormous urban and demographic expansion throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Firstly it became the preeminent centre for international intellectual exchange and the central nexus for the trade in luxury goods in Europe. Its status as a capital city only crystallised during the revolutionary decade of 1790s and since then it has remained the epitome of government centralisation. This module will chart some of these changes but will not focus solely on the development of the urban fabric of Frances capital city but rather seek to understand the site as one of the most important European hubs of the age. Indeed in the 1780s with over thirty-one foreign embassies and other diplomatic posts the French capital was both one of the largest and most impressive diplomatic centres in the world. During these centuries the city remained a major intellectual, cultural, imperial, industrial & manufacturing crossroad for continental Europe. The instability & weakness of French political institutions allowed a space for free-thought to emerge which provided a haven for revolutionary exiles from all over the world. By studying the history of Paris this course will place such developments in their broadest political and trans-European context.

     EN899      - Paris: The Residency


     
      Paris: The Residency contributes to the poetry and prose strands of the MA in Creative Writing and the Literature strand of the Paris Programmes. The objective of Paris: The Residency is to give students as close an experience as possible of what it might be like to be a writer in residence or retreat, and to produce work inspired by a specific location for a specific period of time.  The emphasis will be on producing a body of creative work for the main assessment.  This module aims to enable students to develop their practice of writing through both the study of a range of contemporary examples and practices, and constructive feedback on their own work. Throughout their stay, students will be exposed to a wide range of instances of exemplary, contemporary work relating to Paris, or which was written by writers whilst staying, or living in Paris (as suggested by the indicative reading list). They will be encouraged to read as independent writers, to apply appropriate writing techniques to their own practice and to experiment with voice, form and content. The approach to the exemplary texts will be technical as well as historical. At every point in the module, priority will be given to students own development as writers. It is an assumption of the module that students will already have a basic competence in the writing of poetry or prose, including a grasp of essential craft and techniques. The purpose of this module will be to stimulate students towards further development of, and to hone their already emerging voices and styles through engaging with various literary texts, raising an awareness of place as the starting point for new writing, and how their work can develop with large chunks of time for independent study, reflection and exploration of a city like Paris.

     FR803      - Paris and the European Enlightenment


     
      This module is designed to examine the overlapping influence of Early Modern and Enlightenment thinkers and writers mainly based in England, France and Germany. A particular focus is provided by the Parisian setting: several key figures (such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Diderot) lived in Paris for a significant part of their lives, and Paris was a city second to none in its importance within a vast international exchange of ideas during the Enlightenment period. The module will encourage students to consider the historical contexts out of which the various texts emerge, and show how ideas passed between England, France, Germany and elsewhere. Attention will consistently be paid to the tension between Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment in Europe. This will include allowing the students to understand debates, in the eighteenth century (and, if appropriate, since then), around the following issues: empiricism; sensationism; toleration; freedom of speech; aesthetics; literary genres; the 'pre-Romantic'.
