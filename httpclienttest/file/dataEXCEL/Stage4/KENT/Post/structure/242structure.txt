Course structure


 The course is designed to train digital effects artists to work in industry. Our successful former   students are working in London and for international companies in areas ranging from television graphics to architectural visualisation. Although the thrust of the course is towards high end film special effects and animation, the standards and techniques you learn allow you to work in numerous other areas of digital effects.

The primary industry jobs the course is oriented towards include: technical directors in assistant, creature development, lighting effects, look development roles, compositors in compositing, digital paint and roto roles, modellers and trackers/matchmovers. For a smaller project or company roles would include that of a 3D generalist, 3D artist, effects artist or compositor. These are not easy to achieve, as global competition is fierce and success depends on much better than average concentration and constant practise to grasp the essence and modern techniques of digital visual effects.

 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   EL837 - Professional Group Work


   
    This module is a group project which allows the student to work on a model of an actual animation job provided by our industrial partner. Each group produces an animation from established plates and models to a 4 week deadline. The student works with a model of a production pipeline, becoming familiar with the production process, chains of approval and departmental divisions.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL839 - Effects Animation


   
    This module is 15 credit module focused on a sequence of practical workshops which introduce the editing and compositing tools used on the course and is supported by a series of lectures concerned with high definition video technology. Students gain an understanding of the theory and standards of colour models, and how they are applied to motion imaging in video, HDTV and digital-cinema and become familiar with the relevant broadcast and compression standards that are used for high definition digital video. In addition, students work together in teams of 4 or 5 students to produce a short digital film which includes high definition video footage and composited effects.

   EL863 - Advanced 3D Modelling


   
    This module covers in depth inorganic or hard surface and organic modelling in 3D graphics applications. It includes exercises in NURBS and Sub Division modelling and texturing with UVs in Maya and Mudbox.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL864 - Pre-Visualisation


   
    Whilst the Visual Training module covers the understanding necessary for animating characters in single shots, this 15 credit module develops the understanding of, and ability to create planned continuity between shots in sequences - to be able to see and modify sequences of a final film before they are made. To be adept at this requires an in-depth knowledge of the language of film shooting and editing, its terminologies and practical usages. Students completing the module will be able to read and make a storyboard, animatic or previsualisation at a professional level. They will be able to adjust to different types of shooting in their construction of 3D scenes and will understand the professionally used technical terms and the methods used in film editing, to the extent necessary for 3D animators.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL867 - Technical Direction


   
    This 15 credit module is concerned with the use of lighting and shading for storytelling and visual communication. Students will gain an understanding of the fundamental, theoretical concepts in digital lighting as well as gain the necessary skills and experience to produce customized light and shading models which provide aesthetic possibilities not available from "off-the-shelf" packages. Undertaking this module students become expert in the use of the Mental Ray renderer.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL868 - High Definition Compositing


   
    This 15 credit module specifically addresses the technical and artistic requirements for compositing video and 3D elements at a high resolution. Compositing is the artistic blending of several disparate elements from a variety of sources into a single image while making all the component elements appear to be in the same light space and shot with the same camera. On successful completion of the module, working at a high definition resolution, you will be able to composite a moving digital video element from one or more clips seamlessly into another; change seamlessly lightings, camera moves and framings, colour balances and film textures on existing digital video clips; build and match camera movements of 3D environments from and to the 2D evidence in digital video clips; model, texture, animate and light a 3D computer graphics object for seamless compositing into a live action digital video clip.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL869 - Film and Video Production


   
    This module introduces students to the key elements of film form and film-making technique. It provides them with the opportunity to look at their MSc work within the broader context of film art, and to learn basic film-making skills including screenwriting, camerawork, sound recording, and editing. Classes will comprise a mixture of practical workshops and seminars focused on how film-makers uses specific cinematic techniques including narrative construction, visual composition, camera motion, colour, sound, and editing. Students will have a chance to experiment with these techniques by working in small groups to produce a short dramatic film work.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL831 - Digital Visual Art set-up


   
    Animation Setup is an intensive 4-week, 15 credit module at the start of the Programme which has been designed to get all students up to speed regarding the complicated technical processes that surround current animation practice. This module is concerned with the skills and procedures employed professionally including modelling, rigging, skinning, muscle dynamics, texturing and lighting and is undertaken as a set of practical exercises where the student creates a scene with four organic characters and a machine, to be composited in a DV shot. Delivery is by means of Lectures, Demonstrations, Workshops and Assessed Practical Assignments.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).
