Course structure


 You undertake a substantial project in the area of finance or financial econometrics, supervised by an experienced researcher. Some projects are focused on the analysis of particular complex data sets while others are more concerned with generic methodology.

You gain experience of analysing real data problems through practical classes and exercises. The course includes training in the computer language R.

   MA890 - Practical Statistics and Computing


   
    Nonparametric Methods: This part of the  module comprises approximately 10 lectures on nonparametric methods, showing how they are applied in practice for testing goodness of fit to a distribution, including tests of normality, for testing randomness of a sequence, and for comparing two samples. Practical Statistics: There is no fixed syllabus for this component of the course. Students gain experience of practical data analysis through a series of assessments that confront them with unfamiliar data, which may require the use of techniques introduced in any of the other core modules of the Programme.Statistical Computing: At the start of the module, students are introduced to, and gain experience of, the document preparation system LaTeX, which enables the production of high-quality mathematical documents. Then there are sessions in which students learn the statistical package R, using a mixture of lectures and hands-on computing workshops. The initial aim is for students to gain familiarity with importing and manipulating data, producing graphs and tables, and running standard statistical analyses. The later parts of the module focus on the use of R as a programming language, introducing basic programming mechanisms such as loops, conditional statements and functions. This provides students with the means to develop their own code to undertake non-routine types of analysis if these are not already available in R.

   MA867 - Project


   
    The module, which is compulsory for students of MSc in Statistics and MSc in Statistics with Finance, enables students to undertake an independent piece of work in a particular area of statistics, or statistical finance/financial econometrics and to write a coherent account of the material. A list of possible topics, together with names of Staff willing to supervise these projects, will be circulated to students in the autumn term. Projects suitable for MSc Statistics and MSc Statistics with Finance will be indicated. Students are given a briefing document containing regulations and advice on the preparation of projects. Students then choose a topic after consultation and agreement with the relevant member of staff. This is done early in the second term. The range of projects available is wide, encompassing both practical data analysis and more methodological work, although projects that are primarily theoretical will typically have obvious practical applications. In addition, students can propose their own topics, provided a suitable supervisor can be found.The dissertation is expected to be about 10,000 words excluding any appendices containing computer code and so forth. The dissertation is submitted in early September, before the start of the next academic year.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   MA883 - Bayesian Statistics


   
    The origins of Bayesian inference lie in Bayes' Theorem for density functions; the likelihood function and the prior distribution combine to provide a posterior distribution which reflects beliefs about an unknown parameter based on the data and prior beliefs. Statistical inference is determined solely by the posterior distribution. So, for example, an estimate of the parameter could be the mean value of the posterior distribution.This module will provide a full description of Bayesian analysis and cover popular models, such as the normal distribution. Initially, the flavour will be one of describing the Bayesian counterparts to well known classical procedures such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.Current methods for inference involving posterior distributions typically involve sampling strategies. That is, due to the complicated nature of some posterior distributions, analytic methods fail to provide meaningful summaries. Hence, sampling from the posterior has become popular. A full description of  sampling techniques, starting from rejection sampling, will be given. The syllabus will be:Conjugate models (prior and posterior belong to the same family of parametric models). Predictive distributions; Bayes estimates; Sampling density functions; Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings samplers; Winbugs; Bayesian regression and hierarchical models; Bayesian model choice; Decision theory; Objective priors; Exchangeability.
