   EL849 - Research Methods & Project Design


   
    The aim of this module is to prepare students for the Masters Project and for possible future research work. It begins with an introduction to MATLAB and SIMULINK tools which are used in most taught masters modules at Kent. The module also includes details about how to write a literature review and produce a viable project plan. Students learn how to use tools such as RefWorks and EndNote to produce and maintain reference databases. It also addresses important issues concerning the definition of a project and the consideration of ethical and Intellectual Property Issues. Techniques and guidelines for writing clear and concise English are discussed in detail.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   EL874 - Computer & Reconfigurable Architectures


   
    This module introduces some fundamental and advanced computer and reconfigurable computing architectures including CISC, RISC and VLIW. FPGA technology is used as the basis for describing different forms of reconfigurable computing architectures that are becoming increasingly important in many consumer and industrial applications. Specific emphasis will be given to the understanding of computer arithmetic architectures and methods which are used in the design of embedded systems. The module uses practical design examples using both C and VHDL to illustrate the material.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL876 - Advanced Control Systems


   
    This module is concerned with the design of practical feedback controllers.  Feedback is used in a control system to enhance the performance of the plant or process, and to reduce the sensitivity of the system to uncertainty from external effects (for example, disturbance signals and noise on measurements) and model uncertainty (i.e. the difference between the assumed model of the process to be controlled and the actual industrial plant which is likely to be time varying and uncertain).  If the performance specifications are achieved in the presence of the expected uncertainties, then the control is said to be robust. This course will provide an overview of a number of techniques for robust control, with an emphasis on design and simulation to enhance learning.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL822 - Communication Networks


   
    This module will take you through communication network protocols, as used in local-area networks and wide-area networks. It includes the protocols used in the wireless LAN (WiFi) standards, Ethernets, and IP networks. The analysis of network performance is also covered. A network simulator (OPNET) is used to reinforce the material, and to provide you with a means of visualising protocol operation and network performance.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL829 - Embedded Real-Time Operating Systems


   
    This module introduces Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and their implementation and use in Embedded Systems. The concepts of scheduling algorithms, threads, multitasking and inter-process communication are discussed in detail using practical examples and case studies. It includes advanced topics in Hardware/Software Co-design. Extended mini-projects are used to reinforce the material presented in the lectures.


    Credits: 15 credits

   EL875 - Advanced Instrumentation Systems


   
    This module covers modern sensors and advanced measurement systems for a diverse range of industrial applications. General measurement principles and concepts are introduced. The module focuses on digital imaging based and intelligent measurement and monitoring techniques. Real life industrial case studies are included to enhance students learning experience in the design and applications of cutting edge instrumentation technologies.

   EL858 - Advanced Pattern Recognition


   
    This module introduces advanced methods for pattern recognition with emphasis to multi-source systems. A detailed analysis of the Bayesian classification framework is followed by an introduction to error estimation and advanced feature selection and extraction techniques. Multiple classifier systems, including intelligent and dynamically adaptable classifier combination strategies, such as genetic algorithms, are studied as the basis for the development of state-of-the-art systems including multi-biometric strategies.   A discussion of score normalisation methods and the use of soft biometrics are also included in this module.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL890 - MSc Project


   
    A major practical system will be developed either in an industrial context or within the department.  There are no formal lectures - students will undertake the work in their own time under the regular supervision of a member of the academic staff and, where appropriate, industrial collaborators.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   Assessment

  
   The project module is examined by a presentation and dissertation. The Research Methods and Project Design module is examined by several components of continuous assessment. The other modules are assessed by examinations and smaller components of continuous assessment. MSc students must gain credits from all the modules (180 credits in total). For the PDip, you must gain at least 120 credits in total, and pass certain modules to meet the learning outcomes of the PDip programme. PDip students are not expected to take the MSc project (EL890).
