Course structure


At the beginning of your registration, you and your supervisor produce a document outlining your plan for your degree. During the three years of your registration, you have regular contact with your supervisor to report on progress, get advice and make plans. At the end of this three-year period, you submit your PhD or enter an extension year.

In the first year of study,  research students are required to take PhD-specific advanced training courses agreed upon with your supervisory team. Available courses include: macroeconomic theory, microeconomic theory, computational methods, macroeconometrics, microeconometrics, experimental economics, and topics in applied macroeconomics. Further research training in subsequent years includes advanced reading groups, research workshops, weekly research seminars  and specific courses related to our research.
