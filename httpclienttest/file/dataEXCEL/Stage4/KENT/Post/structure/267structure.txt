   HI915 - Landscapes of the Great War: Interpretations and Representations


   
    This module will explore the way in which different academic disciplines have dealt with the three main overarching experiences of the Great War  mobilisation, attrition and endurance and remobilisation. Each week students will be exposed to the differing interpretations and will explore the major differences between them. The agreed historical facts are therefore the starting point; the harnessing and meanings is the terminus. The module convenor will be present in all sessions chairing them and facilitating the dialogue with the contributing academics. Where possible it is expected that each seminar will have multiple academic contributors. Each section will consist of a tripartite format  week one sets up the following week in special collections with the final week being reflections on what was examined in special collections and interpreted according to the approaches of different academic disciplines.

   HI828 - Ireland and the First World War


   
    The module will examine the experience of Ireland during the First World War. There is now considerable historiography available on Irish recruitment to the British armed forces between 1914 and 1918 and this will form the basis for three seminars; considering Nationalist and Unionist reactions to recruitment and the place of Ireland within wider UK recruitment. Political developments, caused largely by the war, namely, the decline of the Irish Parliamentary Party, rise of the Sinn Fein movement and Irish Unionisms acceptance of partition will form another important element of the module. There has been considerable work carried out on commemoration of the Great War in Ireland and Irish commemoration overseas (most notably the building of the Ulster Tower at Thiepval, France in 1921 and of the Irish Peace Park at Messines / Mesen, Belgium in 1998) and this will form the focus for two seminars. Other seminars will consider the Irish economy and the war and Irish paramilitarism between 1914 and 1918.

   HI860 - The British Army and the Great War


   
    This module will examine a number of aspects concerning the British army during the Great War.  The (in)effectiveness of British generalship will be examined, allowing students to explore the rich historiography of this topic which dates back to the so-called, battle of the memoirs in the 1920s.  Consideration will then be given to the structure and expansion of the four armies (regular, territorial, Kitchener and conscript) examining how effectively the British army coped with this massive expansion and trained the newly formed units.  Allied to this, there will be a consideration of manpower policy during the Great War, in particular there will be some discussion given to the propaganda elements involved in the voluntary recruiting campaigns of 1914-16 and the British experience of conscription in 1916-18.  Attention will also be given to the discipline and morale of the British army, which was the only European army of the Great War not to suffer from major problems in this area.  Students will be invited to explore the full aspects of discipline and morale and will consider why the wartime executions of 312 soldiers have come to dominate the historiography.  In terms of the British army in action, this module will contain case-studies of the well known Gallipoli campaign and the Battles of the Somme along with the lesser known so-called 100 days battles at the end of the war to consider the important issue of whether the British army did indeed participate in  what some historians have termed a learning curve during the Great War. Other topics, such as the the experience of women in the British army, the British army on the home front, logistics and officer selection will also be discussed in detail.

   HI815 - War, Propaganda and the Media


   
    The aim of this module is to explore the concept of propaganda and roles of the mass communications media in times of conflict.  This will involve an historical approach which takes into consideration the numerous theoretical problems associated with the study of propaganda as well as the different ways political propaganda has been interpreted and used internationally in time of war or peace. Using case studies ranging from the First World War to the present day, the aim of the module is to enable students to think critically about the manner in which propaganda is disseminated in wartime and the pressures governments, media organisations and journalists face in times of conflict.  The module explores how different types of conflict and changing technology have elicited different relationships between the media, the military and government. The module also examines the impact of the media upon public opinion and the increasingly important part played by the home front in twentieth century warfare.

Placements should, with support from teaching staff, be researched and confirmed in the Autumn Term, with tasks/projects agreed. Seminar sessions on campus will be organised to reflect the placements, offering appropriate reading, discussion and critical reflection. They are an opportunity for students to feedback on work they have achieved, giving presentations to share their experiences with other students. There will also be an opportunity for one-to-one feedback and discussion.
