Course structure


Within the School, there is a breadth and depth of expertise and we can offer high-quality supervision across a wide range of social and public policy areas. There are further details on the research activities and publications of individual members of staff and the School&rsquo;s research units on the website. In addition to regular meetings with individual supervisors, all research students take a research training programme.
