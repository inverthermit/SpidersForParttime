 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   EL849 - Research Methods & Project Design


   
    The aim of this module is to prepare students for the Masters Project and for possible future research work. It begins with an introduction to MATLAB and SIMULINK tools which are used in most taught masters modules at Kent. The module also includes details about how to write a literature review and produce a viable project plan. Students learn how to use tools such as RefWorks and EndNote to produce and maintain reference databases. It also addresses important issues concerning the definition of a project and the consideration of ethical and Intellectual Property Issues. Techniques and guidelines for writing clear and concise English are discussed in detail.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   EL874 - Computer & Reconfigurable Architectures


   
    This module introduces some fundamental and advanced computer and reconfigurable computing architectures including CISC, RISC and VLIW. FPGA technology is used as the basis for describing different forms of reconfigurable computing architectures that are becoming increasingly important in many consumer and industrial applications. Specific emphasis will be given to the understanding of computer arithmetic architectures and methods which are used in the design of embedded systems. The module uses practical design examples using both C and VHDL to illustrate the material.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL822 - Communication Networks


   
    This module will take you through communication network protocols, as used in local-area networks and wide-area networks. It includes the protocols used in the wireless LAN (WiFi) standards, Ethernets, and IP networks. The analysis of network performance is also covered. A network simulator (OPNET) is used to reinforce the material, and to provide you with a means of visualising protocol operation and network performance.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL827 - Signal & Communication Theory II


   
    This module provides you with knowledge in communications theory. It covers optimal receiver design, advanced modulation such as QAM, transmission and performance analysis over wireless multipath fading channels, spread spectrum and multicarrier transmission, and advanced channel coding such as multiple input multiple output (MIMO). Simulink modelling of a digital communication system will enhance your understanding of how the concepts are applied.

   EL829 - Embedded Real-Time Operating Systems


   
    This module introduces Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and their implementation and use in Embedded Systems. The concepts of scheduling algorithms, threads, multitasking and inter-process communication are discussed in detail using practical examples and case studies. It includes advanced topics in Hardware/Software Co-design. Extended mini-projects are used to reinforce the material presented in the lectures.

   EL890 - MSc Project


   
    A major practical system will be developed either in an industrial context or within the department.  There are no formal lectures - students will undertake the work in their own time under the regular supervision of a member of the academic staff and, where appropriate, industrial collaborators.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   Assessment

  
   The project module is examined by a presentation and dissertation. The Research Methods and Project Design module is examined by several components of continuous assessment. The other modules are assessed by examinations and smaller components of continuous assessment. MSc students must gain credit from all the modules. For the PDip, you must gain at least 120 credits in total, and pass certain modules to meet the learning outcomes of the PDip programme.
