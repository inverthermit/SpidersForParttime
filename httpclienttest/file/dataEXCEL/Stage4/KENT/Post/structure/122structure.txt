   Programme aims

  
   This programme aims to:

 produce graduates trained in the processes by which fundamental science is linked to the design and development of modern medicines
 teach you an understanding of the drug discovery process
 provide you with expanded training in the biological sciences technical skills that underpin the processes of drug discovery
 provide you with the experience of critically appraising the research questions and techniques they use routinely in the workplace
 develop a variety of postgraduate level intellectual and transferable skills
 equip you with lifelong learning skills necessary to keep abreast of developments in drug discovery
 provide you with opportunities for shared multidisciplinary learning in drug discovery
 give you the experience of undertaking an independent research project
 provide expert preparation for students who wish to pursue and/or further a career in drug discovery, or wish to proceed to a higher degree (PhD) in topics related to the drug discovery process
 provide access to as wide a range of students as practicable irrespective of race, background, gender or physical disability from both within the UK and from overseas.

  

 
   Learning outcomes
