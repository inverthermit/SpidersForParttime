   PH712 - Cosmology and Interstellar Medium


   
    SYLLABUS:Interstellar Medium The major properties of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) are described. The course will discuss the characteristics of the gaseous and dust components of the ISM, including their distributions throughout the Galaxy, physical and chemical properties, and their influence the star formation process. The excitation of this interstellar material will be examined for the various physical processes which occur in the ISM, including radiative, collisional and shock excitation. The way in which the interstellar material can collapse under the effects of self-gravity to form stars, and their subsequent interaction with the remaining material will be examined.

   PS701 - Topics in Functional Materials


   
    Chemists and physicists are now playing an important role in the growing field of materials research. More recently there has been a growing interest, driven by technological needs, in materials with specific functions and this requires a combination of physics and chemistry. For example, new materials are needed for the energy industry (batteries and fuel cells), for the optics and electronics industry (semiconductors, lasers and wave-guides), and for the environment (sensors, actuators and smart materials). The aim of this module is to introduce students to this area of modern materials and techniques.Examples of the topics that might typically be covered are:1. Crystal growth and defects.2. Liquid crystals.3. Magnetism and Magnetic Materials.4. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).5. Nanomaterials.6. Multiferroics.
