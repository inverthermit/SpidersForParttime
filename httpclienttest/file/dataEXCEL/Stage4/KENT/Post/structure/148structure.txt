Overview


The School has a long tradition of high-quality research among its staff and students. The School&rsquo;s vibrant research culture attracts students from all over the world who conduct research at the forefront of our discipline.

Our research programmes provide a combination of formal research training and individual supervision within a supportive environment, with regular interaction between staff and students. For example, the School runs a weekly Graduate Research Training Seminar, where students are encouraged to present their work and receive feedback from peers and staff. Students enjoy regular meetings with a supervisor and supervisory team, and are also given opportunities to collaborate with other members of staff through the staff research seminar and the activities of the Conflict Analysis Research Centre
.

Students are encouraged to participate in the annual postgraduate research conference, during which various staff members discuss the work of research students, and outside speakers offer plenary lectures. Research students will also be able to benefit from the skills training offered by the University&rsquo;s Graduate School.

The breadth of expertise
 within the School enables us to provide research supervision on a very wide range of topics across  the area of International Conflict Analysis. Current projects of students studying in this area include: Peacebuilding Palestinians: the Hamas-Fatah Rapprochment, The Impact of Music on Conflict Resolution, Young People, Peace and Education, Horizontal Inequalities, Intra-State and Social Conflict.
