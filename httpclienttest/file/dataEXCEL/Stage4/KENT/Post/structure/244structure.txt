Course structure


 Our MSc in Engineering with Finance teaches concepts of finance at the level suitable to engineers on one hand, while providing strong knowledge of quantitative and computational methods to analyse real data, on the other.

Students acquire skills required in jobs such as investment analyst, financial analyst, stockbroker, market risk specialist etc. Previous students have applied for jobs in financial companies such as investment banks (eg Investec, Bank of New York Mellon), software trading platform developers (eg Murex) and management companies (eg Pentland Group plc). Advice about careers in the financial sector is provided and talks delivered by professionals are organised by the University.

This taught MSc course combines a balanced mix of subjects in engineering and quantitative finance, and is based on modules containing lectures, examples classes, directed self-study and PC-based laboratory classes.

 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   EL858 - Advanced Pattern Recognition


   
    This module introduces advanced methods for pattern recognition with emphasis to multi-source systems. A detailed analysis of the Bayesian classification framework is followed by an introduction to error estimation and advanced feature selection and extraction techniques. Multiple classifier systems, including intelligent and dynamically adaptable classifier combination strategies, such as genetic algorithms, are studied as the basis for the development of state-of-the-art systems including multi-biometric strategies.   A discussion of score normalisation methods and the use of soft biometrics are also included in this module.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL859 - Econometrics Applied to Finance


   
    The aim of the module is to give the students a comprehensive introduction and overview of theoretical and practical aspects of financial econometrics. This module ensures that students have a solid foundation in statistical inference and econometrics with particular emphasis on the special features that are prevalent in quantitative finance.

   EL871 - Digital Signal Processing (DSP)


   
    In this module, you are taken through the fundamental of digital signal processing. The course includes a basic introduction to the representation and processing of signals in the digital domain and the design of digital filters. Application examples including JPEG and MPEG image and audio compression standards are used to illustrate the use of the theoretical material presented in the course.The course makes extensive use of MATLAB to enable students to grasp the subjects more readily.

   EL876 - Advanced Control Systems


   
    This module is concerned with the design of practical feedback controllers.  Feedback is used in a control system to enhance the performance of the plant or process, and to reduce the sensitivity of the system to uncertainty from external effects (for example, disturbance signals and noise on measurements) and model uncertainty (i.e. the difference between the assumed model of the process to be controlled and the actual industrial plant which is likely to be time varying and uncertain).  If the performance specifications are achieved in the presence of the expected uncertainties, then the control is said to be robust. This course will provide an overview of a number of techniques for robust control, with an emphasis on design and simulation to enhance learning.

   EL877 - Strategic Analysis of Financial Systems


   
    The lectures will provide an introduction to concepts of Finance.  The module is based on group-projects supported through lectures and tutorial classes and directed self and group studies. Groups of 4-5 students will be given a real-world financial topic to research on. Students have to read relevant financial-journal articles, collect relevant financial data and applied mathematical models to propose analyses and forecasts.

   EL878 - Project Design


   
    The aim of this module is to prepare students for the Masters Project and for possible future research work. It begins with an introduction to MATLAB and SIMULINK tools which are used in most taught masters modules at Kent. The module also includes details about how to write a literature review and produce a viable project plan. Students learn how to use tools such as RefWorks and EndNote to produce and maintain reference databases. It also addresses important issues concerning the definition of a project and the consideration of ethical and Intellectual Property Issues. Techniques and guidelines for writing clear and concise English are discussed in detail.

   EL879 - Portfolio Theory and Asset Pricing Models for Engineers


   
    This module will examine current theories on portfolio management and developing asset models to assist risk management of financial services firms. Topics studied include: Efficient market hypothesis, measures of investment risk, portfolio theory, models of asset returns, asset pricing models, Brownian motion, martingales, stochastic calculus, Ito processes and stochastic models of security prices.
