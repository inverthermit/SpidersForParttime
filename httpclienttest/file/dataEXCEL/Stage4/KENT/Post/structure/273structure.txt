   SO869 - Theories of Crime


   
    In the late modern period we are presented with an extraordinary wealth of criminological theory.  Past and present paradigms proliferate and prosper. This course examines these theories, placing them in the context of the massive social transformations that have taken place in the last thirty years. It is not concerned so much with abstract theory as criminological ideas, which arise in particular contexts. It aims, therefore, to situate theories in contemporary debates and controversies and allows students to fully utilize theoretical insights in their criminological work. In particular we will introduce the current debates surrounding cultural criminology, the debate over quantitative methods and the emergence of a critical criminology.

   SO870 - Research Methods in Criminology


   
    This module provides grounding in the theories, logics and methods that underpin criminological research. As such, students will learn about the principles involved in designing, carrying out and interpreting research. The module focuses on the relationship between empirical data (what is observed/measured in the real world) and the development of theory (academic thought). Students are encouraged to learn how to ask appropriate criminological questions and to design studies which draw on the most appropriate methods to answer them. These methods include both primary empirical work (quantitative and qualitative) and secondary work (e.g. dataset analysis, literature analysis). The module thus is also concerned with how data can be interpreted and analysed. Beyond equipping students with intellectual and practical skills in the field of criminological research, the module fosters a capacity to critically evaluate research in general.

This is achieved through engaging in a detailed consideration of cutting edge theory and research in the fields of cultural and visual criminology. The module will place criminality, policing, crime prevention, music, photography, emotionality, extreme sports, advertising, protest, war, physicality and the film in new and exciting contexts. The module equips students with the necessary theoretical tools and modes of social inquiry to make sense of a late-modern world permeated by crime and its control.

We will then go on to focus on the following key substantive themes; gangs, violence and territoriality; drugs, alcohol and night time economies; young people, urban space and antisocial behaviour; and the criminal justice response to youth crime.  Throughout the module, attention is given to the importance of understanding the connections of youth crime with race, class and gender and at the same time, engages with key theoretical ideas and debates that inform our understandings of youth crime.  Within the organisation of the module the content will include practical newspaper workshops where students will be encouraged to co-operate on issues based around the above themes and to participate verbally within the context of class discussions, group presentations and class debate.

     SO998      - Dissertation


     
      The aims of this module are twofold:First, to provide students with the opportunity to independently carry out an in-depth inquiry to investigate a research question(s) of their choice, producing a coherent review of the relevant literature, a logical discussion and a clearly communicated set of conclusions in the form of a dissertation.Second, to prepare students to become research-minded practitioners in order that they have the capacity to undertake research in practice settings and/or take a lead role in supervising others in such work.The following represents the likely format for curriculum delivery:In mid-November, there will be a two-hour workshop, which will outline the aims, the structure, the process of the dissertation. During the spring term, the students will finalise their proposal with their chosen supervisor. If the dissertation requires ethical research approval, an application will be submitted to the school research ethics committee by the beginning of the summer term. During the summer term and vacation, students will meet their supervisor every fortnight to discuss the progress of their dissertation. The supervisors will provide feedback on written work and will set monthly work plans and targets for the students. The dissertation topic will relate to a key question, issue and problem within social science.

     SO605      - Crime , Media and Culture


     
      The module provides students with an understanding of the contested cultural meanings underpinning crime.  Too often criminology is satisfied taking definitions of criminality at face value, when really it means very different things to different people and in different contexts.  The module examines how media representations propagate particular perceptions of crime, criminality and justice.  It goes on to consider the manner in which those who 'offend' experience and interpret their own behaviour, which may be focused on the attainment of excitement or indeed on attaining their own conception of justice.  The module explores these contradictions in a world where crime, control and the media saturate everyday life.  In doing so it considers a diverse range of concepts; youth culture, hedonism, hate crime, risk taking, moral panics, the image, emotionality and consumerism.  We examine the nature of a late-modern society where criminality inspires great fear and resentment, whilst at the same time it provides imagery which is harnessed to produce entertainment and sell a range of consumer goods.  Students will become familiar with cutting edge research and theory in the fields of Cultural Criminology, Visual Criminology, and Media and Crime, placing issues such as music, photography, street gangs, extreme sports, newspapers and nights on the town in new and exciting contexts.
