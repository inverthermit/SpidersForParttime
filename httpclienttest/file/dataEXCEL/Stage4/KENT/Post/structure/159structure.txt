   SP998 - Advanced Research Project in Psychology


   
    All students undertake a supervised empirical research project in an area of psychology relevant to their chosen MSc programme, and submit it as a typed dissertation of 8,000-10,000 words. The aim of the dissertation is to test the student's ability to plan, execute, analyse, and report a piece of independent research in the relevant setting. The dissertation requires detailed theoretical knowledge of the discipline, an appreciation of the ways in which that knowledge has been applied in previous research and practice, and the methodological and statistical skills to set up a scientific investigation. Supervision is provided by the principal teaching staff and by other appropriate staff with research interests in a student's chosen area. Students are advised to read the School's Ethics pages for information on submitting applications for ethical approval to the School and to relevant outside bodies.Timetable: Students are encouraged to approach potential supervisors early to discuss possible topics for research. A research proposal is written and agreed with the supervisor in the Autumn Term. An ethical application is also submitted to the School's Research Ethics Panel and outside ethics committees if appropriate. The research is conducted in the Spring and Summer Terms. The deadline for submission of dissertations is in August.

   SP813 - Advanced Topics in Intergroup Relations


   
    This module examines advanced theory and research in intergroup relations. We consider the nature of social categorisation processes and how stereotypes develop, persist and change. The module then examines the relationship between intergroup perceptions and prejudice, and how intergroup relationships influence both variables. The module examines how and why stereotypes and prejudice become manifested as discrimination and intergroup conflict, and then how groups become mobilised to perform collective action. We study the motivational and social elements in intergroup relationships, social identity as a group member, and how these issues can be studied both in the laboratory and in real world settings.This module examines advanced theory and research in intergroup relations.

   SP844 - Advanced Topics in Group Processes


   
    This module provides an opportunity to study at an advanced level the literature on group processes and intergroup relations and to familiarize oneself with the current small group perspectives on groups. The module builds upon knowledge of social psychology and in places biological psychology gained at undergraduate level. We also consider how social psychological and evolutionary theories in combination can explain group processes. Topics that will be addressed include group cohesion, intragroup and intergroup conflict, status and leadership, and group size. The module draws primarily on small group research in social and evolutionary psychology, but we shall also consider perspectives from other fields, such as economics and anthropology. This module involves a great deal of student presentation, participation and discussion.This module provides an opportunity to study the literature on group processes and intergroup relations at an advanced level and to familiarize yourself with the current small group perspectives on groups.

   SP852 - Developmental Psychology in Professional Practice


   
    This module offers an insight into how developmental psychology theory and methods are used in professional settings. Students will receive lectures from professionals working in fields such as education, healthcare, and clinical psychology, who can explain, first-hand, current issues/problems where developmental psychology could provide insights or solutions. The invited speakers will outline major theories that inform practice and critically evaluate the role of developmental psychology in their professional settings. The module will be responsive to 'hot topics' in the settings represented.This module offers an insight into how developmental psychology theory and methods are used in professional settings.
