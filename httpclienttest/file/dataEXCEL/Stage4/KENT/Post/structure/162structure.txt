This year, the focus will be on emotion, memory and language, looking in particular at the role of emotion in attention, learning and memory, and the impact of labels on thought and actions. Practical applications and relevance to a general understanding of behaviour will be emphasised throughout.

     SP611      - The Neuroscience of Cognitive Disorders


     
      This module will build upon the cognitive theories and research methods explored in those modules taught at Stages 1 and 2. The central theme of the module will be to focus on distinct neuropsychological deficits acquired through stroke, such as hemi-spatial neglect, prosopagnosia, aphasia and amnesia. The idea will be to give students a grounding in how different strands of neuroscientific research - behavioural, cognitive, structural, physiological - have both advanced our understanding of neuropsychological disorders and informed on the design of relevant intervention strategies.

      This module is concerned with contemporary concepts, theories and findings in this broad area of social psychology and how they may be applied with benefits for individuals, groups and society. We will address the question how individuals form and maintain an understanding of themselves, other people, and the world they are living in. Drawing on cognitive principles, we will study the processes that underlie human judgments, behaviour, and decision making in real-life contexts. Students will have the opportunity to propose new research to address an unanswered research question, and apply their knowledge to represent scientific psychology more fully and accurately to the wider public.
