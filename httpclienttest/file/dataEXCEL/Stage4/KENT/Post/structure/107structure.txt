Course structure


 This programme enables you to obtain an LLM by spending your first term at Kent, and your second at one of our partner universities in Europe, before returning to Kent to complete a dissertation. During your second term, you complete a comparative research paper, supervised by Kent staff, on an area of law that you have studied at Kent and your partner university.

You are required to take three compulsory modules from the range of taught LLM modules at Kent, follow an approved programme of study at our European partner university and produce a comparative research paper of 7-8,000 words and a dissertation of 15-20,000 words.

   LW915 - 'Reading' Murder Cases, 1860 - 1960


   
    This module seeks to examine significant murder trials during the period 1860-1960 from various perspectives. It will consider the murder trial not only as a legal episode but also as a theatrical, social, cultural and ideological phenomenon. It will thus explore the social construction of murder and murder sensationalism, and will consider celebrated cases that may include the cases (as accused or victim) of Madeleine Smith, Charles Bravo, Florence Maybrick, Dr Crippen, Edith Thompson and Ruth Ellis.

   LW839 - Environmental Quality Law


   
    This module provides an introduction to the law on environmental quality and a preface to regulatory themes that are pursued in other environmental modules. In common language, the module is about the law relating to 'pollution', but, as will be seen, this is a concept that is quite difficult to define with the precision that is needed as a basis for legal rights and duties. 'Environmental quality' is a broader term, encompassing issues as to the degree of contamination that is considered acceptable in relation to the three environmental media of water, air and land. Broadly, the module is organised around the progression of approaches that law has taken towards the regulation of those activities that have been identified as most damaging to the environmental media. Although, this involves careful examination and evaluation of national laws relating to pollution control, attention is increasingly focused upon regulatory requirements drawn from European Union and international law. The module seeks to assess different models and strategies for environmental quality regulation against broader objectives for the environment in reflecting upon what it is that is to be regulated, and why, and whether actual approaches to regulation are the best way of achieving this.  Topics coveredSession 1: Objectives of environmental quality lawSession 2: Environmental quality and private rights Session 3: Environmental liability and environmental human rightsSession 4: Water quality regulationSession 5: Air quality law Session 6: Waste management lawSession 7: The Integration of pollution controlSession 8: Enforcement and the Environment Agency

   LW814 - Public International Law


   
    This module provides a detailed study of the history, rules, doctrines and institutions of public international law. It offers a critical analysis of the international legal order and a firm basis upon which to found arguments concerning the political importance of international law. The module pays special attention to the way in which the evolution and operation of the international legal order influence not only international relations, but also daily domestic life.At the end of the course students will be able to assess, both internally and in context, the main the rules, doctrines and institutions of public international law. Students will also develop the necessary tools to reflect critically on some of the most important problems and tensions that define the contemporary global order: from calamities resulting from war, international interventions and surveillance strategies in countries like Afghanistan, Libya and Pakistan, to the everyday effects of increasing socio-economic disparities and environmental decay in both the Global South and the Global North. The teaching, discussions and readings in the module will equip students both with a doctrinal understanding of public international law, and with an approach to the field that is grounded in a Critical, Socio-Legal and Law and Humanities perspective.

   LW827 - Banking Law I


   
    Banks and other financial institutions operate in an historically and socio-economically determined context. The legal rules which regulate them in domestic English law are drawn from statutory, regulatory and common law sources. International agreements and European Community directives also influence their capacities, powers and obligations. This module aims to study the operations of banks and other financial institutions from a perspective which takes their context into account. Critical legal analysis will have as its focus the basis of English domestic banking and finance law. Topics will include the role of trusts, the banker/customer relationship, netting and set-off, third party secured transactions over the family home, electronic transactions, civil remedies and banking regulation, with particular stress on the recent overhaul of the role of the Bank of England and the establishment of the Financial Services Authority as an overall supervisory body which reduces the traditional English reliance on self regulation of financial institutions.A risk management perspective will be adopted throughout the module.

     LW801      - Intellectual Property


     
      Over the past few decades, the scope of intellectual property has grown significantly. The goal of the module is to provide an overview of these areas from different angles in order to be able to assess this expansion. In so doing, it will examine this area of law from historical, theoretical and practical perspectives. The emphasis throughout the module is on reflexive critique. That is, we will study the different modes of justifying intellectual property; the different historical approaches to trace the ways in which we can understand the political economy of intellectual property and we will look at the past to try to find ways of thinking about the present situation of international legal regimes. On a more contemporary level, we will study the interaction between intellectual property and health, the problems posed by biotechnology, as well as the more practical question on the way of producing evidence in intellectual property trials. No prior knowledge or study of intellectual property is required.

     LW844      - Legal Aspects of Contemporary International Problems


     
      There are a number of ways to approach the field of international law. It can be treated doctrinally as a system of rules from various sources  such as treaties, state practices that are seen to have the binding force of law, and general principles shared across domestic jurisdictions  built up over time to regulate interactions between states and other entities. It can be studied as a historical phenomenon, emerging from out of a colonial history with contemporary implications. It can also be studied as an (imperfect) approach to addressing international 'problems', placing international law in broader social, political, and historical contexts as one possible source of 'solutions'. This course highlights international laws limits and possibilities in relation to a set of contemporary inter- and trans-national concerns, including the use of armed force, responses to emerging security threats, and unresolved territorial disputes. It focuses on key themes of international law, such as sovereignty, statehood, self-determination, and the regulation of armed conflict, drawing upon perspectives from the humanities and the interpretive social sciences. It explores these overlapping themes as they emerge across several issues and case studies, bringing international law into a relationship with contemporary geopolitics, political theory, and the fields historical inheritance. Along the way, we will address philosophical and theoretical questions such as the binding character of international law, problems of representation and interpretation, and the rhetorical dimensions of customary international law. Topics covered The topics covered vary year to year to align with changing circumstances and also according to student interest, but are anticipated to be as follows:- The use of force and the law of armed conflict - Reframing sovereignty: the responsibility to protect- Regulating the global arms trade- Targeted killing- Enforcing the prohibition against torture- Border conflicts and colonial legacies in international law

     LW847      - World Trade Organisation (WTO) Law and Practice I


     
      The establishment of the WTO on 1 January 1995 has signalled the beginning of a new era in international economic relations. Unlike the GATT, whose main purpose was the reduction of barriers on trade in goods, the WTO legal regime reach deeper into more areas of policy-making, ranging from the regulation of services and investments to the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, through its Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) the WTO has the capacity to generate case-law on the resolution of disputes under the WTO agreements that it covers. This marks a significant shift from the earlier GATT dispute settlement mechanism as it creates, for the first time on the multilateral level, a binding decision-making apparatus. Thus any serious attempt to understand the nature and development of international economic law requires a careful and detailed study of the WTO and its law and practice. It is the cornerstone of the new global economic order. This module offers a comprehensive overview of this evolving legal and regulatory order.Topics covered1.  Theoretical and Political Approaches to International Economic Regulation of Trade; the main actors: states, multinational enterprises, civil society and NGOs2.  Free Trade Theory and Practice3.  The Institutional Context: the Bretton Woods System, the GATT and the WTO4.  The WTO and developing countries: GATT preferences and WTO Special and   Differential Treatment5.  The Dispute Settlement Understanding6.  Trade in Agriculture7.  Trade in Services8.  Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights9.  The rise of 'mega-market' trade agreements10.
