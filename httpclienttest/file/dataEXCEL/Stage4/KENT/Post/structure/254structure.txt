 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   TZ861 - Social Psychology of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities


   
    All academic modules are taught using a combination of web-based resources, reading, the introductory workshop and a one-week workshop in the Spring. For each module, there will be web-based materials including video-recorded lectures, web-based discussions/seminars, and quizzes/group exercises. Students are also expected to conduct their own literature searches and follow-up the core reading and the reference lists for each topic coveredThe aim of this module is to teach the basic facts about the nature and origins of intellectual and developmental disabilities, including definitions of learning disability, epidemiology, biological, social and environmental causes of learning disability. In addition, characteristics of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities will be considered (including cognitive and social characteristics) along with issues such as autism, ageing, transition, early intervention, physical & mental health, parenting, sexuality and people with intellectual and developmental disability in the criminal justice system.


    Credits: 10 credits
     (5 ECTS credits).

   TZ863 - Service issues in Intellectual and Development Disabilities


   
    The aim of this module is to give students an understanding of organisational issues involved in learning disability services, including institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation, theories of normalisation and criticisms of these theories, methods of analysing quality of life and care and ways of producing change in services. This module is taught as a web-based guided study module with seminars at several points in the first term. For AIIDD students, this module is closely linked to the service placement and discussion and application of web-based units will occur during placement supervision.


    Credits: 10 credits
     (5 ECTS credits).

   TZ864 - Practical Placements


   
    aim of the placements is to give students practical skills in analysis and intervention in intellectual and developmental disabilities, under skilled supervisionAll students in Analysis and Intervention in Intellectual Disabilities will be required to work in two different placements during their programme. The first placement will be based at the Tizard Centre supervised by Dr Julie Beadle-Brown. This placement will involve the assessment of a local service-providing organisation and the development and monitoring of an action plan with the service. Placement sessions occur mostly in week long blocks spread throughout the year from October to March, with part-time students conducting less of the assessment but continuing to monitor progress in the service until the beginning of July. Some of the sessions occur at the Tizard Centre and involve preparation for the work in the placements. The second placement will happen during Term 3 and the summer (2-3 days per week for a total of 44 days). Part-time students do this placement in the second year of the course. These placements will be based in a community learning disability team, specialist or advisory service or a residential and day service, supervised by a clinical psychologist, or similarly trained practitioner. Students can expect to do some placement preparation or writing up work in their study time, although this should not be extensive. Students are expected to complete work with at least 3 clients (from assessment through to intervention and evaluation) during the placement plus to take advantage of any other opportunities available to them to broaden their experience and meet the placement objectives


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   TZ865 - Extended Essay


   
    All students will write one 6000 word essay on a topic which requires them to draw on material from the service issues, social psychology and behavioural analysis and intervention modules. This will be done over the course of the year for full time students and in the second year for part time students and will be submitted during the third term of the final year. 


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   TZ830 - Research Methods


   
    The aim of this module is to teach students about research methodology and the knowledge needed to access and interpret the research literature. For those who take the statistical analysis element, the aim is also to teach appropriate statistical techniques for the analysis of quantitative data. The emphasis will be on methods of data collection and analysis which will be useful in practice settings, so that advanced multivariate techniques will not be taught.

   TZ994 - Research Project in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities


   
      During the first term of the course students will develop ideas for their research project and will be given the opportunity to choose a research project proposed and supervised by members of the course team or other Tizard staff (see Appendix 4 of course handbook for the list of topics for the current year). Students who choose to design their own project will be allocated a dissertation supervisor. Students following the MSc in Analysis and Intervention in Intellectual and Developmental Disability are required to do an empirical dissertation. All other students can choose between either an empirical or a non-empirical (e.g. policy or research review) dissertation. Students develop a proposal (assessed) for their research project with advice from their supervisor and apply for ethical approval either to the Tizard Ethics Committee (Ethical Review Checklist available on web-based resources) or to another ethics committee such as those in the NHS.  


    Credits: 60 credits

   Assessment

  
   Each of the four taught modules is assessed by a one-hour, web-based, multiple-choice exam and an extended essay. In addition, the Research Methods module involves short assignments and a worked problem. Placements are assessed by two 2,000-word service reports and one 4,000-word case report, plus feedback by placement supervisors.
