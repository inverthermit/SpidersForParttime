   EN835 - Dickens, The Victorians and the Body


   
    This module explores the Victorians' fascination with the body and its metaphors.  Using the works of Dickens as its principal lens, the module will explore notions of disease, infection, health and illness in the national body, the social body and the biological body.  Engaging with debates on laissez-faire economics, prostitution, nationalism, and anxieties concerning sexual and fiscal production, this module will explore how authors, thinkers and artists of the nineteenth century worked through ideas about the body in Victorian culture.

The module explores the benefits and problems derived from reading literature and culture by means of a postcolonial and postimperial lens. Through the study of crucial texts and events, both historical and current, the module analyses the birth of imperialist narratives and their complex consequences for the world today.

   FR866 - Literature and Theory


   
    This module will introduce students to a wide range of theoretical positions with the aim of enriching their understanding and appreciation of literature and critical practice.  We will begin with the thinking of Nietszche and Freud, before examining that of Saussure, Benjamin, L&eacute;vi-Strauss, Genette, Foucault, Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Kristeva, Cixous, and Irigaray.  As well as encouraging a critical engagement with the claims of the theories themselves the module will examine a number of representative theoretical readings of literary works. Students will learn to evaluate these various thinkers and use their ideas, as appropriate, in their own writing.

   EN818 - American Modernism 1900-1930 (Teaching Period I)


   
    This course examines the growth and development of the 'modernist aesthetic' in American Literature during the first three decades of the twentieth century.  The emphasis in American Modernism 1 is on fiction, but there will be room for students to pursue particular interests they may have in drama and the visual arts in the United States during the modernist phase. Some attempt will be made to consider American Modernism in the wider international context; suggested reading in European Modernism is appended to this reading list.The seminar programme is arranged along chronological lines; we can, however, adjust our 'itinerary' according to student interests. Well take reading weeks at some point in mid-term (in consultation with students in the group) and in the final week of term, week 12 (when youll need time to work on your essays).

   EN832 - Hacks, Dunces and Scribblers: Authorship and the Marketplace in the Eig


   
    This module explores the construction and contestation of authorship between the publication of Alexander Popes brilliant Grub Street satire, The Dunciad (1728) and of James Boswells Life of Johnson (1791). In this period, notions of authorship underwent significant change as the image of the author as craftsman (or less flatteringly as tradesman) gave way to the image of the author as original creator or genius  an image that still informs our understanding of authorship to this day. Through an exploration of a wide variety of novels, satires, periodicals, and biographies, as well as visual images we will explore how the modern authors fortunes were shaped by such factors as the decline of the patronage system, the growth and democratisation of the literary marketplace, the emergence of the woman writer and the labouring-class or unlettered genius.Topics for discussion will include the myth and reality of Grub-Street; the gendering of authorship; the relationship between authorship and nation; the economics of authorship; the birth of the literary critic; canon-formation; literary celebrity and scandal.

   EN871 - Origins of Modern Poetry


   
    This module is an introduction to the work of some of the canonical figures of early 20th century poetry, such as T S Eliot and Ezra Pound, set alongside that of some more recently established figures of the same period, such as Mina Loy and Laura Riding. The module looks at the major methods of writing poetry in this period, as well as the established frameworks of critical discussion which accompany these works. We learn to read this poetry both micrologically - ie as far as possible 'on its own terms' - and macrologically in relation to a variety of discourses and contexts. We relate the poetry to its early modernist forbears, to its immediate social and critical situation, and to modern critical and cultural debate on topics as feminism and democracy. Seminars discuss important works of the period and their critical reception, and will also provide an opportunity for you to present your own papers for discussion.

   FR820 - Paris: Reality and Representation


   
    The curriculum includes a selection of texts from various countries, all readily available in English and all specifically relevant to the modern history, evolving population and changing appearance of Paris and to how these aspects of the city has been perceived and represented in literary prose. The set texts are by writers from different periods and of various nationalities and they are all set in and inspired by Paris. The texts are chosen for their high literary quality, but also because they represent essential aspects of the citys evolution and exemplify various narrative strategies and ways of engaging with the realities of life in the city, always shaped by personal preoccupations and sensibilities. This varied selection within the genre of prose fiction allows study of Zolas naturalism and his presentation of the political and aesthetic implications of baron Haussmans plans for urban renewal and control; Edith Whartons perspective as an American incomer; Andr&eacute; Bretons combination of oneiric urban encounters with photographic illustrations of the city, inserted into the text; Jean Rhyss clearly gendered experience of the city in the 1920s and 1930s; the identity of the city as a site for postwar liberation and literary dynamism in the work of expatriates from the Beat generation; and the representation of todays city as a centre for immigrant communities and cultural diversity. The primary texts are thus all Paris-focussed but are chosen to open an international perspective on the literary representation of an increasingly cosmopolitan city.
