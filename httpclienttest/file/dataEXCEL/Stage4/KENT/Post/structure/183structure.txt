 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you. Modules SS806, SS802, SS803 an SS821 are compulsory. All other modules listed are optional.


 

      
   SS806 - Dissertation


   
    The research projects are conducted with the supervision of an appropriate subject supervisor who will advise the student on issues such as methodology, analysis and presentation whilst the student takes responsibility  for organising, conducting, analysing and presenting the research as required. The proposal for the study will have been  approved as part of the research methods module. 


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   SS821 - Contemporary Perspectives in Sport Research


   
    This module critically examines key contemporary issues within sport and exercise science. It will address current topics and research evidence from a range of different sub-disciplines of sport and exercise science. Students will be expected to draw on the knowledge they have developed at UG level to debate contemporary issues in sport and exercise science. Students will be expected to demonstrate an awareness of the changing face of knowledge in the exercise sciences, and will be introduced to the more controversial and less mainstream theories that challenge the existing dogma. The module content will therefore consist of key contemporary issues (at the time the module is delivered), from the main sport and exercise sub-disciplines.

   SS822 - Return to Sport


   
    The aim of this module is ensure you know when your athlete is ready to return to sport following injury, illness or surgery.  Topics covered will include return to sport criteria for different components of fitness and rehabilitation. These will include strength, proprioception, agility, Range of Movement (ROM), flexibility, cardiovascular. A range of both clinical/lab and field based tests will be covered during the module. Assessment will be at the end of the module and in the form of a presentation.


    Credits: 20 credits
     (10 ECTS credits).

   SS820 - Applied Athlete Support


   
    This module aims to provide students with the supervision and extra underpinning knowledge to provide scientific athlete support to a client. The majority of student time will be taken up with one-to-one consultancy time with a client and analysing and providing feedback on their testing data. Some lecture and laboratory time will be used to ensure key principles are covered, but students will be expected to generate a case study of the consultancy package they have provided.


    Credits: 20 credits
