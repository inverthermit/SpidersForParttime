Overview


The School of Politics and International Relations is one of the most dynamic places to study Politics and International Relations. 

We combine high-quality teaching with cutting-edge research in a supportive environment that welcomes students from all over the world. All lectures and seminars on postgraduate modules are informed by the latest research and scholarship, and are delivered by full-time academic staff who have internationally recognised expertise in their field. The School has grown significantly in the last few years and now has over 30 academic staff based at two locations, Canterbury and Brussels. The School is cosmopolitan, with staff originating from eight different countries, and well over half of all postgraduate students come from outside the UK.

We pride ourselves on our global outlook, which is reflected in the wide range of international partnerships. We are the only politics and international relations school in the country with a postgraduate centre in Brussels, which allows students on some of our programmes to follow part, or their entire, programme in Brussels. Agreements with partner institutions in France, Germany, Poland and Russia enable us to offer Double Award versions of the MAs in European and Global Governance, International Relations and Peace and Conflict Studies, leading to the award of two Master&rsquo;s degrees.
