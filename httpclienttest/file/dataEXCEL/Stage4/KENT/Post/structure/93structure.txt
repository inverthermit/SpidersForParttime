   HI878 - Methods and Interpretations of Historical Research


   
    This course investigates the nature of historical research at its highest level. While postgraduate students are expected to become highly specialised researchers in their own particular field or subfield, this course encourages them to consider history as a wider discipline and to broaden their approach to evidence and interpretation. Students will be expected to engage with a variety of intellectual viewpoints and methodological approaches to the discipline, and consider the impact that other disciplines have had on the study of History. A number of dissertation workshops will be arranged to help students with their dissertations.Part I: ParadigmsHistoricism: the emergence of historical science in the 19th centuryStructural history: the challenge of the social sciencesCultural turns: history after the end of the master narrativePart II: FieldsReligious historyOral history Military historyPropaganda studies Environmental history History of medicinePart III: Portfolio and Dissertation workshops Book reviewsAnnotated bibliographies and historiographical reviewsDissertation outlinesIn addition, we will undertake field trips to archives and research libraries.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   HI866 - Science and Medicine in Context


   
    There is no better way to understand how scientific knowledge is made and consumed today than to look at how this happened in the past.  Our examples come from 400 years ago up to the present day, and highlight how changes in the media of knowledge have shaped our understanding of science  printing presses, public lectures, museums and TV. How have audience needs and interests changed during this time, and how has the medium affected the message?  Themes and Topics The printing press and the scientific revolution Cabinets of curiosity: the first museums? Science on display in the 18th century Science and the steam-driven press in the 19th century Science and film in the 20th century Science wars and the public understanding of science in the late 20th century

   HI817 - Deformed, Deranged and Deviant


   
    From those viewed as medical marvels in the nineteenth century to questions surrounding quality of life in the late twentieth century, the course explores the continuities and changes in the relationship between medical science and difference.  Between the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and into the twentieth, the increasing influence of medical practitioners ensured that disability, deformity, disfigurement and mental illness were categorised through a medical perspective. Categories about the acceptability of physical and social norms were constructed from the eighteenth century, indeed, the term normal was not commonly used in the English language until the 1840s. In the nineteenth century, the growth of capitalism and the concentration on industrialization, excluded those deemed different from the workplace and the community as they were not judged to be economically useful. In addition, philanthropic gestures which grew in the nineteenth century, saw people who were categorised as different, moved from mainstream society into institutions, which were often supported by the medical profession. Medical practitioners and the general public were fascinated by difference in body and mind, and often those considered different were observed, studied and experimented on. The influence of medical practice grew in the twentieth century and the course will explore this in relation to (amongst others) the two World Wars, the growth of special institutions and new types of therapy. Overall, the course will investigate the ways that medicine has understood, categorised and treated those whose body or behaviour was considered different. It will also examine the body and mind as contested sites; spaces occupied by those considered different; the establishment of normality versus deviance; the changing conceptions of difference in this historical period and the shifting theories and methodologies of medical practice in relation to it. Topics include:The history of anatomyIdiocy and feeblemindednessMadness The development of forensic scienceMurderDying and the rituals of deathAgency, freakery and the politics of displayHomosexuality as devianceMadness and mental health

   HI857 - Geiger Counter at Ground Zero: Explorations  of Nuclear America


   
    This module critically examines the surface and decay of Nuclear America in the twentieth century. Responsible for ushering in the modern atomic era, the USA is widely acknowledged as a pioneer in nuclear technology and weaponry.  Receptivity towards the atom has nonetheless shifted over time: atomic materials once heralded the saviour of American society (through the promise of reactors delivering electricity to cheap to meter) have also been deemed responsible for long-term environmental problems and doomsday anxieties.  Why the atom has received typically bi-polar and polemic responses is of great interest here.  Along with events of global significance (such as the bombing of Hiroshima), the module also covers the more intimate views of American citizens living and working close to ground zero.  Personal testimonies come from atomic foot soldiers traversing blast sites in the 1950s and protesters trespassing across reactor sites in the 1970s.  In particular, the module examines the role of media, propaganda and image in inventing popular understandings of the nuclear age, as well as the contribution of atomic scientists to national discourse. Themes and Topics:Popular and Scientific Ideas of Radioactivity The Manhattan Project and the Decision to drop the BombCold War (1): The RosenbergsAtomic Veterans and explorations of Ground ZeroCivil Defence and Fallout CultureAtomic Movies (1) Fantasy Cold War (2): The Cuban Missile CrisisProtesting the Peaceful Atom: Diablo Canyon and Three Mile Island Atomic Movies (2) Realism and SurvivalismCold War Memory, Legacy and Atomic Tourism

   HI881 - Museums, Material Culture and the History of Science


   
    This module will explore the physical things, from pencils and air pumps to buildings and particle accelerators, that are essential to making scientific knowledge and, therefore, to understanding and communicating its history and practice. It will explore the literature on using objects, images and buildings as historical sources and museological approaches to the collection and interpretation of scientific instruments and related objects. Students will visit museums and have the opportunity to talk to curators about their work, as well as reflecting on existing displays. The module will be assessed through a mixture of practical tasks, based on real objects and displays, and an essay, encouraging critical reflection on the scholarship and museum practice encountered over the term.

   HI883 - Work Placement


   
    This module is organised around a work experience placement, undertaken in an institution relevant to the student's Masters' programme. This may be a museum, archive, school or other institution involved in engaging or communicating history and/or science to specific audiences or the general public.The curriculum is flexible to allow students to work around other modules, to adapt to the requirements of different placements and to follow their interests. Placements should, with support from teaching staff, be researched and confirmed in the Autumn Term, with tasks/projects agreed. Seminar sessions on campus will be organised to reflect the placements, offering appropriate reading, discussion and critical reflection. They are an opportunity for students to feedback on work they have achieved, giving presentations to share their experiences with other students. There will also be an opportunity for one-to-one feedback and discussion.
