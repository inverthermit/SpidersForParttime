Course structure


 In addition to the core module (Reading the Contemporary, taught jointly by academics and practitioners in the School of English, the School of Arts, The School of Music and Fine Art, and curators at the ICA), you will be able to choose from a wide variety of modules in the areas of contemporary literature, creative writing, film, drama, and history and philosophy of art. You are invited to attend an induction at the ICA at the start of your studies to introduce you to the facilities and are encouraged to make use of the ICA&rsquo;s programme of seminars and events. In addition, the MA will also involve research trips and a public presentation opportunity at the ICA.


Professional Development

Besides engaging with ICA curators through the core module in Reading the Contemporary, students will also participate in three research trips in the Autumn, Spring and Summer semesters, led by ICA curators and responding to contemporary artistic developments, media and platforms. Students will be encouraged to apply to vocational placements within the ICA's Creative Team for two days a week over 3 months, working directly with the curators of Talks, Exhibitions, Artists' Film Club, Cinema or Learning and Touring programmes. Students will enjoy unique access to the knowledge of the ICA's Creative Team while working on they final project, and will have the opportunity to present their projects publicly at the ICA at the end of the year.
