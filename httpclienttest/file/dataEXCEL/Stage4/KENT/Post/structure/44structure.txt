Course structure


Research on HE at Kent includes work on education policy, the philosophy, economics, management and politics of HE, disciplinary teaching and learning, learning technology, academic practice and sociological perspectives on academic work.

The Centre draws on expertise from across the University, so we can offer high-quality PhD supervision; we work very carefully to match you with a supervisory panel that suits your interests and ambitions. There are further details on the research activities and publications of individual members of staff on the Centre&rsquo;s website

In addition to regular meetings with supervisors, all research students take part in a tailored research training programme, which can include research methods modules offered by the Centre or by other schools, as appropriate. As well as attending the regular research seminars offered by the Centre, you are encouraged to participate in the seminars, workshops, newer researcher networks and masterclasses offered by the scholarly bodies in the discipline, including the Society for Research into Higher Education (SRHE) and the British Educational Research Association (BERA).
