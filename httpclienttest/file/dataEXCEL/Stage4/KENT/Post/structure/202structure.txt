Course structure


 The programme starts with three linguistics modules (Sounds, Structure and Meaning) and a module on language awareness for teachers (Language Awareness and Analysis) so that you  have a firm grasp of the linguistic bases of language teaching and how to apply them to the classroom.

In the spring term the focus is on how languages are learned (Second Language Acquisition), how you  can improve classroom technique (The Practice of TESOL), plan for your students&rsquo; needs (Course and Syllabus Design) and provide them with materials which will be interesting, effective and motivating (Materials Evaluation and Development).

The dissertation will be an opportunity to plan and develop a piece of empirical research which can be of direct relevance to your current or planned teaching situation.




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   LL832 - Meaning


   
    This module will introduce students to the study of semantic meaning. The focus will be on developing a fluency with analytical tools in semantics and pragmatics, and using these to explain a range of phenomena. Topics covered will include truth-conditional semantics, reference, presupposition, conversational implicature, and Speech Act Theory. Students will have the opportunity to reflect upon real data and analyse the processes of conveying and understanding meaning.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   LL833 - Structure


   
    This course constitutes an in-depth introduction to syntax, focusing specifically on the question of what constitutes knowledge of language. By examining a core area of linguistic investigation (syntax), students will have the opportunity to explore the form and structure of the various kinds of linguistic knowledge speakers possess. The investigation will proceed from a theoretical as well as a descriptive perspective, and students will be encouraged to evaluate theoretical claims in the light of observations drawn from a wide range of languages. As such, the module will equip students with the theoretical and methodological tools required in the specialised modules and will highlight the crucial role of description in supporting and testing theoretical claims.

   LL834 - Second Language Acquisition


   
    This module will review and critique past and current theories of Second Language Acquisition from a range of theoretical perspectives: linguistic, cognitive, psychological and social. It will also examine the wide range of factors which affect the second language learner and how these might be mitigated. It will then continue by indicating the implications for teaching and learning and how far these have an impact on approaches, methods, strategies and techniques in the classroom.

   LL838 - Sounds


   
    This module deals with the linguistic study of speech. It covers how speech sounds are produced and perceived and what their acoustic characteristics are (often referred to as phonetics), as well as how speech sounds are organized into sound systems cross-linguistically (often referred to as phonology). Emphasis will be placed on the sound system of English (including dialectal variation) but basics of sound systems across the worlds languages will also be briefly covered and contrasted with English. Finally, the course will cover the differences between the traditional static view of speech sounds as articulatory postures and the organization of running speech, together with the repercussions that our current knowledge about running speech has for our understanding of phonological systems, their organization and formal representation.

   LL840 - Course and Syllabus Design for TESOL


   
    The theoretical basis and different approaches to syllabus and course design will be introduced. The key concepts, principles and rationale for process, procedural, lexical, functional and task-based syllabuses will be appraised and evaluated. The influence of Second Language Acquisition theory and educational, cultural, social, economic and political factors on the syllabus will be considered when writing and adapting designs for groups of learners in a range of contexts. Ways of assessing students needs as part of the process of planning and designing a syllabus and course will be addressed.

   LL841 - Language Awareness and Analysis for TESOL


   
    This module will introduce students to language awareness, give an overview of approaches to language analysis for TESOL in the linguistic fields of phonetics, syntax, morphology, semantics, pragmatics and discourse. It will present frameworks and approaches for the analysis of a wide range of text type in both spoken and written English with the aim of sensitising students to language and cultivating their skills for their personal linguistic development and for those they teach in the English language classroom.

   LL842 - Materials Evaluation and Development for TESOL


   
    This module will consider the reasons for using teaching materials, who should design them and how they should be designed.  Frameworks will be applied to critically evaluate commercially produced materials for their authenticity and their appropriacy for specific groups of learners and the contexts in which they are taught. Where materials are considered to be inappropriate for a specific context, students will gain the skills to adapt existing materials or create their own.

   LL843 - The Practice of TESOL


   
    This module will give an overview of the theories and good practice which underpin TESOL. It will show how these have developed and shaped current trends in TESOL pedagogy. Recent and up-to-date research into language learning and teaching will be reviewed, evaluated and assessed for its implications for classroom practice. Current thought on the teaching of the elements and skills of language will be reviewed and assessed and applied to a variety of contexts in which TESOL takes place. Participants will be able to observe and evaluate TESOL teaching and develop their own practical teaching skills through peer group teaching, teaching small groups and or/one-to-one teaching under the supervision of experienced practitioners.

   LL899 - Research Dissertation


   
    The aim of the dissertation is to develop further the students ability independently to plan, research, formulate arguments and communicate research findings in a coherent manner within an extended piece of written work. The dissertation functions both as the culmination of the years work and as a bridge between guided and independent research, preparing (and, it is hoped, encouraging) students to continue on to carry out research at Doctoral level.The topic of the dissertation will usually be based on, and develop from, work undertaken on one or more of the taught modules undertaken in the course of the MA.


    Credits: 60 credits

   Modules are typically assessed by a 3-4,000-word essay, but assessment patterns can include practical/experimental work, report and proposal writing, critiques, problem solving and seminar presentations. You also complete a 12-15,000-word research dissertation on a topic agreed with your supervisor.
