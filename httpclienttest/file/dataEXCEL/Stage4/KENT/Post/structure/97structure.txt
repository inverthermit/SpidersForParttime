The British Cartoon Archive was established in 1973 at the University of Kent, to collect and preserve British cartoons of social and political comment, and make them freely available for study. It is a library, archive, gallery and registered museum, dedicated to the history of British cartooning over the last 200 years. CartoonHub, an online cartoon database shared with a number of other institutions, is also the world&rsquo;s largest electronic archive of cartoons, with a catalogued database of over 120,000 images, the majority of which are stored in original in the Centre. It is therefore an excellent resource for research students, capable of supporting a range of different research interests and specialities.
