Course structure


You have your own studio space in which to explore and test your studio work, with full access to workshops and high quality resources at our new multimillion pound development on the Chatham Historic Dockyard, just 55 minutes from London.

The programme welcomes students who wish to pursue any form of artistic practice in an interdisciplinary studio-based research environment. Research students are supported through their studies by a supervisory team and regular supervisory meetings.

You are provided with research methodology training sessions to ground and support your research in its early stages, as well as offered a breadth of research seminars, workshops and symposia.

Research students are encouraged to enrol on the Researcher Development Programme provided by the University&rsquo;s Graduate School, and to attend regular Research Centre and Research Group led events. You have access to a national and international cross-disciplinary visiting lecture series enabling you to access specialists in your territory and beyond.
