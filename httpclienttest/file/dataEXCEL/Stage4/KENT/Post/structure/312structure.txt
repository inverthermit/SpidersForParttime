Course structure


 Full-time students complete the MA in Terrorism and Society over twelve months. Study is divided between taught modules, which last for one term each, and dissertation work. For full-time students, a total of six modules must be taken over the first two terms. Supervised dissertation work, on a relevant agreed subject, is then undertaken during the remainder of the academic year.

The MA can be taken on a part-time basis, typically over two years but flexible arrangements are also possible. When taking it over two years, part-time students choose three modules in each academic year, and write a supervised dissertation thereafter.

The programme is also offered in a 120 ECTS credit format (comprising nine taught modules plus a dissertation over 18 months)  and as a Postgraduate Diploma (comprising six taught modules only)  worth 120 Kent credits (60 ECTS credits). Both the 120 ECTS credit  version and the Diploma can also be taken on a part-time basis.
