Course structure


 The PCert and PDip are supported by student-learning sets, downloadable interactive computer-assisted learning and a range of resources, including the library facilities at Medway and your practice base, and the internet.

Completing the practice elements of the programme leads to both an academic award and the award of a Statement of Completion of General Pharmacist Training (SCGPT) from an accredited training centre.

The MSc General Pharmacy Practice is available through both universities to candidates who have completed their diploma. You will complete a research project within your Trust, supported by one or two academics with expertise in practice research. You will gain expertise in research techniques relevant to your project, you will be supported to write a protocol and complete either an NHS or University Ethics application (whichever is appropriate) and to collect and analyse your data.

You will need to have the support of your Trust to carry out your project. Ideally this will include at minimum some protected time to collect data. If you are not sure of what  topic you would like to research, we can help you find a suitable project relevant to your working environment.

We identify a lead academic to support you. You can expect to take 6 months to a year to complete your research &ndash; if NHS ethics approval is required this can be a lengthy process. You will be required to write a thesis and prepare and defend a poster suitable for submission to a conference. You will also have to write two short reflective essays about your experience of research.
