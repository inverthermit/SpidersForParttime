   EN842 - Reading the Contemporary


   
    'Reading the Contemporary' is a cross-disciplinary module the aim of which is to find out what it means to read the contemporary period through its aesthetic practices. The module will be co-taught by staff from the School of English, the School of Arts and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, with seminars alternating between the Canterbury campus and the ICA (London).The module has three main objectives. First, it will consider what it means, in a theoretical sense, to think about our contemporary moment. Second, it will address key themes and issues in contemporary culture and will consider how they bear on and are shaped by recent aesthetic forms. Third, through the seminars delivered at the ICA, which will arise directly out of the ICA's programme, students will be introduced to examples of current aesthetic practice.


    Credits: 30 credits

   HA825 - Post-Conceptual Art and Visual Arts Criticism


   
    The construct of the post-conceptual in relation to visual arts practice has two principal inflexions. Firstly, it delineates a generation of contributors typically born in the 1960s and 1970s for whom the legacies of Modernism and conceptual art are cultural givens. Secondly, it situates a range of practice (including media art and digital platforms) in relation to expanded and evolving contexts of criticism, cultural consumption and curation.The proposed curriculum will follow recent visual arts-based critical responses to the development of particular genres and associated shifts in cultural production.  For example, this will include the attention given to emerging practices of self and group curation and the rationale for the doubling or multiplying of artistic agency variously demonstrated by collectives such as SUPERFLEX, Claire Fontaine and by a range of contemporary working partnerships. The module will explore how several recent critics have mobilised and applied ideas of the political to account for distinctive thematics within recent practice. Considering some of the recent distinctions noted by the art critic Claire Bishop, the module will evaluate different forms of sculpture and installation practice (immersive, site responsive, site independent and site specific) and how these mediate changing contexts and conditions of production and  spectatorship.

   HA826 - History and Theory of Curating


   
    This module will introduce you to the history and theory of curating through a series of detailed case studies from the early modern period to the present day. These will focus on how collections have been formed and maintained, the nature of key institutions in the art world like museums and galleries, and in particular it will examine the phenomenon of the exhibition. Different approaches to curating exhibitions will be examined, and the responsibilities of the curator towards artists, collections, and towards the public will be analysed. Broad themes in the theory of curating and museology will be examined. Wherever possible the case studies chosen will draw on the resources and expertise of partner organisations, such as Canterbury Museums and the Institute for Contemporary Art.

   HA835 - A Matter of Taste: The Art and Aesthetics of Food


   
    Taste, perhaps the most intimate of the five senses, has traditionally been considered beneath the concern of philosophy, too bound to the body, too personal and idiosyncratic. Yet, in addition to providing physical pleasure, eating and drinking bear symbolic and aesthetic value in human experience, and they continually inspire writers and artists. In this module, we investigate why taste came to occupy so low a place in the hierarchy of senses and why it is deserving of greater philosophical respect and attention. We begin with the Greek thinkers who classified taste as an inferior, bodily sense; we then trace the parallels between notions of aesthetic and gustatory taste that were explored in the formation of modern aesthetic theories. Recent scientific views of how taste actually works will also be discussed. Turning to taste's objects  food and drink  we look at the different meanings they convey in art and literature as well as in ordinary human life and we examine an approach to the aesthetic value of taste that recognizes the representational and expressive roles of food. Throughout the module we will address the issue of the objectivity of taste and critically investigate the age-old clich&eacute; that says de gustibus non est disputandum (in matters of taste, there can be no dispute).

The historical development of portraiture and its different subgenres will be traced, influential portrait artists will be discussed and their work will be critically analysed  all of which will be addressed within a broader theoretical framework, focusing on philosophical issues such as the nature of personal identity, objectification, the definition of art, and theories of representation and genre.
