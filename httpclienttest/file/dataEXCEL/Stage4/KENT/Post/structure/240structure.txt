 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   EL822 - Communication Networks


   
    This module will take you through communication network protocols, as used in local-area networks and wide-area networks. It includes the protocols used in the wireless LAN (WiFi) standards, Ethernets, and IP networks. The analysis of network performance is also covered. A network simulator (OPNET) is used to reinforce the material, and to provide you with a means of visualising protocol operation and network performance.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL849 - Research Methods & Project Design


   
    The aim of this module is to prepare students for the Masters Project and for possible future research work. It begins with an introduction to MATLAB and SIMULINK tools which are used in most taught masters modules at Kent. The module also includes details about how to write a literature review and produce a viable project plan. Students learn how to use tools such as RefWorks and EndNote to produce and maintain reference databases. It also addresses important issues concerning the definition of a project and the consideration of ethical and Intellectual Property Issues. Techniques and guidelines for writing clear and concise English are discussed in detail.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   Assessment

  
   The project module is examined by a presentation and dissertation. The Research Methods and Project Design module is examined by several components of continuous assessment. The other modules are assessed by examinations and smaller components of continuous assessment. MSc students must gain credit from all the modules. For the PDip, you must gain at least 120 credits in total, and pass certain modules to meet the learning outcomes of the PDip programme.
