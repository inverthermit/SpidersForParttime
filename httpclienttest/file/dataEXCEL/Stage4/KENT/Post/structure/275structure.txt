   SO657 - Digital Culture


   
    This module will examine the impact of digital technology on our social and cultural lives. It will concentrate on how the Internet in particular has challenged some of our more traditional notions of identity and self, the body, relationships, community, privacy, politics, friendship, war and crime, economics, among others. Lectures will show how some of the basic components of culture such as notions of identity, space, the body, community, and even the very notion of what it is to be human, have been complicated by the rise of virtuality and cyberspace. We will also examine these issues through case study phenomena unique to digital culture, currently including gaming, music, cybersex and social networking.

   SO684 - Globalization and Development


   
    This module aims to develop a critical understanding of one of the most important intellectual and political issues of our times, namely, globalization and its relationship to development in third world societies. Examples of the central issues to be examined are: what is globalization and what forms does it take? What are the most important global institutions today, and how do they affect poverty, inequality, the growth of middle classes, consumption,politics and identities in developing societies in Asia, Africa and Latin America? What effects do global economic treaties under the WTO, IMF etc have upon rural poverty, migration, trade, and urban growth? Why are third worldcities expanding at such a rapid rate, and what consequences does this have? Finally, how can we use the antiglobalization movements to critically evaluate contending theories and practices of globalization?

   SO602 - Social Research Methods


   
    In this module you will begin to understand the process and debates surrounding how researchers learn more about the social world. What techniques and approaches do social researchers draw upon to organise, structure and interpret research evidence? How do we judge the quality of research? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the range of frameworks and methodologies? The first part of the module introduces you to the conceptual issues and debates around the best way to explore social questions, forms and issues, and an overview of some popular methods for doing so. In the Spring Term, you will spend most of your time applying what you have learned in a group research project and an individual research design project.

   SO537 - Racism


   
    What is meant by racism? Charges of racism are seemingly everywhere  in the workplace, in the streets, in everyday interactions. But what exactly is racism? Is it beliefs about racial inferiority or superiority? Is it found in actions and consequences whether people intended to be racist or not? We will first review various theories of racism, and critically assess how changing conceptualisations of racism arise in specific, socio-political contexts. We will also consider whether a colour-blind future is desirable and/or possible.

   SO819 - Quantitative Data Analysis


   
    The module will provide an introduction to the use of Statistical Analysis within the Research Process. It will begin by introducing and discussing different types of measurement and the practical problems of data entry in SPSSW. After discussing basic data description and transformation the focus will shift to Exploratory Data Analysis and the need to examine the data carefully. Simple approaches to summarising data and distributions will then be examined. This will then be followed by methods to test research hypotheses through bi-variate and multivariate methods that are used extensively in the Social Sciences. The final part of the module will look at various issues surrounding the practical issues of quantitative data analysis, such as how to find appropriate data and about presenting research outcomes.

   SO832 - Using Research-Advanced Critical Skills


   
    This course provides students with the understanding and skills necessary to use research, whether within a research career or outside of it.  Building on other training in the details of specific methods, it focuses on two sets of broader questions.  Firstly, it looks at uncertainty in social research  how confident are we about what we know?  In answering this question it looks at issues of quality in qualitative and quantitative research, the difficulties of causal inference and generalisation, coming to conclusions from research reviews, and philosophical issues around truth and values.  Secondly, it looks at the link between research and action.  In doing this, it goes from the very practical (how to ensure that your research is used by policymakers and/or practitioners, and to deal with the political pressures on researchers) to the conceptual (in what ways does evidence get used by wider society?) to the normative (should researchers be critical, and if so, what are their ethical obligations in doing this?).

It will cover:1. Key skills in research design  developing a research question; writing a research proposal; and real-world considerations like ethics, cost, and feasibility;2. Qualitative research design  an overview of different types of qualitative methods and the logic of qualitative design; when to apply qualitative methods; and key design issues such as choosing cases and planning qualitative analysis;3.

Mixed-methods designs, which combine qualitative and quantitative research. This course is complementary to the specialist courses in doing qualitative (SO817) and quantitative (SO819) research, and the course Using Social Research  Advanced Critical Skills (SO832).

     SO867      - Foundations of Sociology


     
      This course is designed to provide a guide to the foundations of sociology by exploring the most influential traditions of writing in the discipline and examining how these were forged on the basis of an ongoing dialogue with the legacy of the Enlightenment.  After situating sociology in its historical, philosophical and theological contexts, the course analyses how the founders of the discipline developed a series of a competing visions of those processes elementary to social and moral life.  Focusing mainly on the French and German traditions of sociology, but also incorporating the British tradition, we progress by examining the tensions that have arisen between collectivist visions of the social whole and competing conceptions of voluntarist inter/action, before focusing on Parsonss attempt to reconcile these approaches within an overarching conception of the sociological tradition. The second part of the course moves away from these classical visions of sociology to those post-classical attempts to reconstruct the discipline on the basis of alternative concerns such as conflict, culture and post-modernity. Here we study a number of perspectives that have contributed to a fragmentation of the discipline.  Whilst most sessions are concerned with debating the dominant theoretical interests that have defined the discipline, others are devoted to investigating key junctures in the development of methodology and research practice. The course aims to provide students with critical insights into the ways in which sociology has been configured as a discipline in response to key junctures in its history.

     SO884      - Race, Difference and Belonging


     
      This module investigates and critically examines the ways in which understandings of race, racisms, difference, and belonging have shaped, both historically, and in the contemporary era, multiethnic societies such as Britain and the USA. This topic is especially pressing, given the vast amount of change in many Western societies - greater cultural diversity, globalization and greater mobility, changes in the manifestations of racism, and changing patterns of family and community life. In what ways do notions of race and racial difference, and contestations over belonging, still matter (or not) in societies today? What competing evidence exists in claims about either the continuing (or declining) significance of race and notions of difference more generally? Should we attempt to transcend race and racial thinking?
