   SO833 - Design of Social research


   
    Module Summary: This module aims to provide students with the skills to develop a research idea and to turn this into a coherent, achievable  and interesting!  research proposal.  The course will be particularly useful for those doing empirical research in their MSc or PhD dissertation, or who will use social research after their studies.In developing these skills, the course also provides an introduction to research methods and methodological debates.  It will cover:1. Key skills in research design  developing a research question; writing a research proposal; and real-world considerations like ethics, cost, and feasibility;2. Qualitative research design  an overview of different types of qualitative methods and the logic of qualitative design; when to apply qualitative methods; and key design issues such as choosing cases and planning qualitative analysis;3. Quantitative research design  an introduction to the logic of quantitative research, and key issues such as turning the social world into numbers; when to apply quantitative methods; issues surrounding generalisation; how to interpret quantitative analysis results, and an introduction to the most common form of quantitative analysis;4. Mixed-methods designs, which combine qualitative and quantitative research. This course is complementary to the specialist courses in doing qualitative (SO817) and quantitative (SO819) research, and the course Using Social Research  Advanced Critical Skills (SO832).

   SO838 - The Idea of Civil Society


   
    The module provides an up to date overview of how key social science thinkers from across the social sciences have understood and analysed the relevance and contribution of civil society in their models and theories. It explores how contemporary scholars have continued to use their ideational frameworks to explore current social, political and economic problems and issues. It starts by acknowledging some of the key antecedents to contemporary notions of civil society in classical and pre-modern thought, and then systematically reviews how leading theorists of, and commentators on, post Enlightenment social and political developments have defined this sphere, and accounted for its roles and contributions in their formulations. Most of these writers have crossed what we now think of as disciplinary boundaries In each case, their basic socio-political models are reviewed, their accounts of civil society explicated and critiqued, and the applications of their contemporary interpreters to civil society issues explored.

   SO867 - Foundations of Sociology


   
    This course is designed to provide a guide to the foundations of sociology by exploring the most influential traditions of writing in the discipline and examining how these were forged on the basis of an ongoing dialogue with the legacy of the Enlightenment.  After situating sociology in its historical, philosophical and theological contexts, the course analyses how the founders of the discipline developed a series of a competing visions of those processes elementary to social and moral life.  Focusing mainly on the French and German traditions of sociology, but also incorporating the British tradition, we progress by examining the tensions that have arisen between collectivist visions of the social whole and competing conceptions of voluntarist inter/action, before focusing on Parsonss attempt to reconcile these approaches within an overarching conception of the sociological tradition. The second part of the course moves away from these classical visions of sociology to those post-classical attempts to reconstruct the discipline on the basis of alternative concerns such as conflict, culture and post-modernity. Here we study a number of perspectives that have contributed to a fragmentation of the discipline.  Whilst most sessions are concerned with debating the dominant theoretical interests that have defined the discipline, others are devoted to investigating key junctures in the development of methodology and research practice. The course aims to provide students with critical insights into the ways in which sociology has been configured as a discipline in response to key junctures in its history.

   SO885 - Social Suffering


   
    In summary, social suffering calls for a new project of social science.  It involves researchers in the attempt to understand how social and cultural conditions moderate the experience of suffering.  It also brings a critical focus to the ways in which such experience serves to expose the moral character and structural force of society within peoples lives. Whilst attending to the particular ways in which individuals struggle to make the problem of suffering productive for thought and action, it also works to understand how, through to the level of collective experience, this contributes to wider dynamics of social change. This course examines these cross-disciplinary issues and debates with the aim of assessing their sociological significance and political implications.

     SO823      - Social Change & Political Order


     
      Much thinking about political order in the modern world has taken the state for granted as a normal feature of political life. It has been common to assume that1) Political order can be observed by observing a set of rules for how government is supposed to operate.2) Political institutions are entirely separate from social relations, or: political institutions are a direct reflection of broader society.3) Social change happens in one direction and change is always for the better.4) Order is the opposite of disorder.The sociological tradition offers many resources for examining empirically a) how government actually works b) how the relationship between the social and the political is imagined and institutionalized in different ways c) how change can be specified as a change in social form before it is evaluated and d) what the order of disorder and the disorder of order might be. In the last two decades, the changes associated with globalization have given new impetus for a historically grounded and empirically rich comparative sociology of political forms. In this course, we will compare political orders across history and across geographical areas or scales, mostly focusing on the west within modernity. We will discuss some of the conceptual tools others have found useful in such an exercise We will try to specify different ways political orders can vary and change and the different social factors that may make one outcome or other more likely. On that basis, we will be able to assess some of the common claims about the changing political order in times of globalization.

     SO998      - Dissertation


     
      The aims of this module are twofold:First, to provide students with the opportunity to independently carry out an in-depth inquiry to investigate a research question(s) of their choice, producing a coherent review of the relevant literature, a logical discussion and a clearly communicated set of conclusions in the form of a dissertation.Second, to prepare students to become research-minded practitioners in order that they have the capacity to undertake research in practice settings and/or take a lead role in supervising others in such work.The following represents the likely format for curriculum delivery:In mid-November, there will be a two-hour workshop, which will outline the aims, the structure, the process of the dissertation. During the spring term, the students will finalise their proposal with their chosen supervisor. If the dissertation requires ethical research approval, an application will be submitted to the school research ethics committee by the beginning of the summer term. During the summer term and vacation, students will meet their supervisor every fortnight to discuss the progress of their dissertation. The supervisors will provide feedback on written work and will set monthly work plans and targets for the students. The dissertation topic will relate to a key question, issue and problem within social science.
