Course structure


 The MA in Architectural Visualisation is jointly taught by Kent School of Architecture and the School of Engineering and Digital Arts. Building on the successful Master's programmes in Computer Animation and Digital Visual Effects, this MA  enables students to develop at an advanced level the skills, knowledge and understanding of digital simulation and 3D modelling which will equip them to become highly skilled professionals in architectural visualisation.

Drawing influence from both architecture and film, this programme offers a progression route into both industries, highlighting the different requirements needed for each profession while exploring the similarities of these markets. In this programme, the professions of architecture, film and animation fuse together, providing students with the ability and understanding to work in each or all of them.

 Modules


 


 

      
   EL837 - Professional Group Work


   
    This module is a group project which allows the student to work on a model of an actual animation job provided by our industrial partner. Each group produces an animation from established plates and models to a 4 week deadline. The student works with a model of a production pipeline, becoming familiar with the production process, chains of approval and departmental divisions.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL838 - High Definition Video


   
    This module introduces students to the key elements of film form and film-making technique. It provides them with the opportunity to look at their MSc work within the broader context of film art, and to learn basic film-making skills including screenwriting, camerawork, sound recording, and editing. Classes will comprise a mixture of practical workshops and seminars focused on how film-makers uses specific cinematic techniques including narrative construction, visual composition, camera motion, colour, sound, and editing.   Students will have a chance to experiment with these techniques by working in small groups to produce a short dramatic film work.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL868 - High Definition Compositing


   
    This 15 credit module specifically addresses the technical and artistic requirements for compositing video and 3D elements at a high resolution. Compositing is the artistic blending of several disparate elements from a variety of sources into a single image while making all the component elements appear to be in the same light space and shot with the same camera. On successful completion of the module, working at a high definition resolution, you will be able to composite a moving digital video element from one or more clips seamlessly into another; change seamlessly lightings, camera moves and framings, colour balances and film textures on existing digital video clips; build and match camera movements of 3D environments from and to the 2D evidence in digital video clips; model, texture, animate and light a 3D computer graphics object for seamless compositing into a live action digital video clip.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   AR821 - Film and Architecture


   
    This module reviews the representation of architecture in film through history, by looking at influential cinematic depictions of the built form.  With light being such an important factor in both disciplines, the links between the two industries are explored, analysing films from early German expressionist cinema through to present-day utopian/dystopian films.  Students will investigate how the cinematic depiction of architecture can alter the character of the built environment and the way in which it is portrayed.  This module aims to explore  the relationship of architecture to lens, and screen to audience.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   AR822 - Virtual Cities


   
    This module will develop skills in visual communication and representation using 3D digital modelling.  Students will develop modelling skills, learning materiality, lighting and high quality rendering skills.  This module will draw from professional practice of a number of industries, such as architecture, film and games, highlighting the priorities that each profession places on the modelling and rendering process.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   AR823 - Digital Architecture


   
    This module will intensively guide students through the procedures of modelling and animation needed for architectural visualisation.  The programme of study will compare the available software packages used in industry and will provide students with hands-on ability to model, animate and render architectural visualisations.  Through a series of exercises advancing in complexity, by the end of this module students will be able to create realistic digital architectural models appropriate for the target industry and application.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL870 - Visual Effects Project


   
    Each student uses all the experience gained on the course to produce a video short in high definition which showcases his or her professional visual effects skills and forms a suitable entree to a professional career.The subject, script, models and soundtrack of the piece are agreed with the academic staff, or is a project from an Industrial collaborator.


    Credits: 60 credits

   Assessment

  
   Modules are taught over three terms, concluding with a Major Project Visualisation, which accounts for one third of the programme. The content of the visualisation is agreed with programme staff and you build a showreel to a professional standard. Each module is assessed by practical assignments. The project work is assessed on the outcome of the project itself.
