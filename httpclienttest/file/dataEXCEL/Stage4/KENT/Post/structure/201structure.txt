Course structure


 Full-time students complete the MA in International Relations with International Law over 12 months. Full-time students must follow six modules during the first two terms, divided into three complementary components. There are two required modules on International Relations and two optional modules, one required module on public international law and one further law option. Supervised dissertation work, on a relevant agreed subject, is then undertaken during the remainder of the academic year.

The MA can be taken on a part-time basis, typically over two years but flexible arrangements are also possible. When taking it over two years, part-time students choose three modules in each academic year, and write a supervised dissertation thereafter.

The programme is also offered in a 120 ECTS credits  format &ndash; comprising nine taught modules plus a dissertation over 18 months &ndash; and as a Postgraduate Diploma &ndash; comprising six taught modules only &ndash; worth 120 Kent credits (60 ECTS) credits. Both the 120 ECTS credits version and the Diploma can also be taken on a part-time basis.

This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   PO824 - International Relations Theory


   
    Whenever we make a statement about international affairs, we rely on certain (often implicit) theoretical assumptions: about power, interests, identities, norms and how they relate to the behaviour of international actors. Whether we like it or not, we are doomed to rely on theories. The starting-point of this course is not that theories are the only possible and all-encompassing approach to the study of international affairs, but that they are helpful to understand, compare and critically evaluate interpretations of international issues: if we all use theoretical assumptions, we better make them explicit and understood, to make sure what exactly we are claiming.International Relations theories are not approached as strict categories with clear boundaries, but rather as a continuously evolving debate. The course does not attempt to give an encyclopedic overview of all theories of International Relations, but rather to confront different views. The main objective is to understand the core differences between different theoretical approaches. The course starts by discussing the nature of theorizing in international relations, pointing out how theories do not simply explain or predict, they tell us what possibilities exist for human action and intervention, they define not merely our explanatory possibilities, but also our ethical and practical horizons  (Smith, 1996: 113).  Some of the core dividing lines underlying theoretical debates (explaining/understanding, positivism/post-positivism, rationalism/constructivism, etc.) are also introduced.. After that, different theories are studied in depth.The course proceeds through successive phases of IR theory. The first phase, that of liberal internationalism (also referred to as inter-war idealism emerged in the aftermath of WW1. We will engage with the leading authors of that tradition and find in their works the foundations of our modern world: international law, economic interdependence and international organization. In the third week we turn to the second phase of IR Theory, classical Realism, who responded to the failure of inter-war idealism by reasserting the nature of the political in IR as being predicated on clashing interests. The English School, who focus on the idea of International Society, are the focus of the fourth week. In week 5 and 6 we move to the first epistemological break in IR, with both Neorealism and Neoliberalism breaking decisively away from the classical approach championed by Hedley Bull. Running in parallel with mainstream IR, Marxist theorists were also developing Methods designed to adapt and apply Marxism to global politics, their work is examined in week 7. In week 8 we encounter another epistemological break: this time between positivism and post-positivism, a debate about the nature and limits of theory that continues to shape the discipline.  In week 9, Critical Theorys focus on human emancipation is brought to the fore. In week 10, the leading challenger to Neorealism and Neoliberalism, social constructivism, will be examined. In week 11, the classes will revolve around two major ethical positions in IR, cosmopolitanism and Realism. The course will conclude in week 12 with a revision session.

   PO825 - Philosophy & Methodology of Politics and International Relations


   
    Students of politics have not been, in general, sufficiently reflective about the nature and scope of their discipline. They just do it rather than talk about it' (G.Stoker). Given that political scientists study people  individuals, groups, states, nations, cultures  rather than things, PO825 moves from the assumption that politics students ought to be reflective about their research. The module aims to provide an opportunity for reflection by presenting some of the key theoretical and methodological debates in politics and international relations. These debates deal with issues such as: the concept of the political and the concept of power; the relationship between structure and agency; the causal and constitutive role of ideas and discourse; positivism and post-positivism; critical theory, emancipation, and the importance of normative questions; an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research, to research design and research ethics.

   LW814 - Public International Law


   
    This module provides a detailed study of the history, rules, doctrines and institutions of public international law. It offers a critical analysis of the international legal order and a firm basis upon which to found arguments concerning the political importance of international law. The module pays special attention to the way in which the evolution and operation of the international legal order influence not only international relations, but also daily domestic life.At the end of the course students will be able to assess, both internally and in context, the main the rules, doctrines and institutions of public international law. Students will also develop the necessary tools to reflect critically on some of the most important problems and tensions that define the contemporary global order: from calamities resulting from war, international interventions and surveillance strategies in countries like Afghanistan, Libya and Pakistan, to the everyday effects of increasing socio-economic disparities and environmental decay in both the Global South and the Global North. The teaching, discussions and readings in the module will equip students both with a doctrinal understanding of public international law, and with an approach to the field that is grounded in a Critical, Socio-Legal and Law and Humanities perspective.

   PO916 - Security in a Changing World


   
    This module focuses on the evolution of security studies as a discipline and its implications for practice. We examine a variety of theoretical and empirical materials that provide students with the basis for analysing pressing questions related to issues of war, security and peace in the world today. This module thus provides a good grounding for understanding contemporary security challenges (such as the environmental degradation, conflict, gender-based insecurity, terrorism, mass surveillance and arms proliferation among others) and our responses to them. It will engage with debates around the broadening and deepening agenda of security studies, which has extended the scope of security studies beyond the nation-state, and the role of new security actors.

   PO8100 - Quantitative Methodology for Political Science


   
    This course is designed for graduate students in Political Science and will serve as an introduction to quantitative methods for social science research. Given that the majority of the highest level research in Political Science is conducted in the language of quantitative methodology, students will learn the use of quantitative research methods as a tool to further their research and participation in debates of the social sciences. Students can further expect to be introduced to not only the means for conducting rigorous, empirical, and quantitative research in social science fields but also how this methodology adheres to the scientific accumulation of knowledge about these phenomena. The course is intended to develop core competencies in quantitative research. These competencies include methodological literacy (the ability to read, understand, and critically assess quantitative research); statistical abilities (the ability to determine, apply, and use the appropriate statistical techniques to inform and/or support an argument as well as understand the limitations of statistical techniques); and research skills (the ability to use and present quantitative methodology to address a research question).

   PO8101 - Comparative Political Behaviour


   
    The module introduces students to some of the core issues in the field of comparative political behaviour, one of the largest groupings within the field of comparative politics. The module begins by considering some of the basic theoretical issues involved in studying political behaviour.  It then moves on to consider explanations for the two most significant issues within the field of comparative political behaviour, namely voting patterns and political participation. Within these blocks, the module includes discussion on various policy-relevant issues. The module then moves on to consider wider issues around political behaviour, notably the nature of public opinion and political representation.

   PO817 - Resistance and Alternatives to Capitalism andDemocracy


   
    This module is situated at the interface of political theory and political economy. It seeks to explore the complex and multi-faceted links between democracy and capitalism in the period from 1848 to the present day. The particular focus is on relations between the state and the market as well as the evolution of different democratic regimes and market economies. Similar emphasis will be on conceptual issues and empirical evidence (though no statistical or econometric skills will be required).The first part of the module examines the formation of market-states, beginning with a critical discussion of this concept in recent scholarship. This will be the starting point for a wider engagement with Smithian, Marxist, Keynesian and neo-liberal accounts. The focus will be on those who theorise the conditions for the convergence of state and market, including Smith, Marx, Keynes and Friedman but also some contemporary theorists. Emphasis will be on strategies of resistance and alternatives to capitalism (e.g. Karl Polanyi, Catholic Social Teaching, civil economy).The second part turns to the evolution of democracy in relation to capitalism. A brief survey of the recent post-democracy literature will be followed by a discussion of key concepts. Examples include the work of the Frankfurt School on capitalism and democracy as quasi-religions and various arguments that formal democratic representation and abstract capitalist exchange engender a society of spectacle. Just as the first part focuses on the state and the market, so the second part puts emphasis on the interaction between the politics of democracy and the economics of capitalism.

   PO936 - Resistance in Practice


   
    This module will look at how ideas of resistance are translated into political action. What are the modalities, costs and consequences of this process? We will look at specific instances of resistance to political authority and examine the techniques of resistance employed, the assumptions that underpin these techniques, and the tensions and problems that arise as ideas are actualised in political reality. Studying historical examples of resistance will help us reflect on the complex relationship between theory and practice in political reality.As part of the Resistance in Practice module, students can choose between submitting an academic essay on a historical instance of resistance and performing a practice of resistance. We envision that such practices of resistance could involve poetry, theatre, painting, sculpture, video, film, photography, music and other forms of artistic expression. The practice has to be a documented practice, which means that students have to submit not just the performance but also a portfolio in which they reflect on what they did and why. Early on in the module, students interested in submitting a documented practice for assessment discuss their ideas with the module convenor, and they will continue to work on their projects with the help of a supervisor.

   PO828 - Theories of Conflict and Violence


   
    This module will examine how conflict research has evolved within the field of political science and International Relations. It will initially investigate competing theories on conflict and violence highlighting specific case studies and new security concerns. The theoretical reflections will focus on the understanding of modern nationalism in world politics as well as different aspects of conflict ranging from inter-state to intra-state conflict. Moreover, students will be exposed to a detailed and critical analysis of the political and constitutional options in societies beset by violent ethnic conflict, with particular emphasis being given to mechanisms directed at the achievement of political accommodation.

   PO831 - The European Union in the World


   
    This module focuses on the position of Europe and the EU in particular - what it does and how it does it - in the world, through the perceptions of the other. The first challenge of this broad approach is to tackle the question what is Europe?, by way of situating Europe between the regional and global change, and understanding its multifaceted, multi-actor and multi-level environment and associated with it challenges, in the increasingly inter-dependent and inter-polar world. As part of the exercise we will focus more specifically on EU actorness reiterated through the changing modes of governance  from disciplinary and hierarchical, to more adaptable and from a distance  and democracy promotion policies, to understand how it behaves vis-&agrave;-vis the outside world. Premised on this, we will examine EU actorness in practical terms by referring to EU interactions with the other  from the neighbourhood, BRICS, to US, and Russia. The objective is to cross-compare what the EU is and what it does to enable wider generalisations of what kind of transformative power the EU is? today, in this increasingly globalising world.

     PO951      - States, Nations and Democracy


     
      The module draws from comparative politics, international relations, and political thought to analyse the past, present, and future of the democratic national state, the dominant form of political system in todays world. It addresses questions such as: Why are some states federal and others unitary? What explains the resilience of nationalism? Does economic integration leads to political disintegration? Why has regional integration gone much further in Europe than elsewhere? Is multi-national democracy possible? The module first charts the emergence of the modern state and its transformation into a national and democratic form of political system. Subsequently, it explores some key aspects of the formation, structuring, restructuring, and termination of states such as the unitary/federal dichotomy, processes of devolution, the challenge of secession, the question of the connections between the economic environment and the number and size of states, the phenomenon of supra-state regional integration, and the connections between nationality and democracy. It concludes by assessing the challenges facing the democratic national state in the 21st century and their likely trajectory in the foreseeable future.

     PO848      - Negotiation and Mediation


     
      This module explores the way in which violent conflict can be resolved peacefully. Focusing predominately on negotiation (bi-lateral discussions) and mediation (third party led dialogue) we discuss both the practical and theoretical aspects of peace processes. The aim is to provide an overview of the main problems negotiators face when attempting to resolve incompatibilities between individuals or groups. In addition to the theoretical discussion focused on case studies and systematic empirical research, we also develop practical skills of course participants by using a range of simulation exercises. The course has two main sections. The first section is focused on negotiation and is designed to teach practical negotiating skills using the Harvard Negotiation method. This is based on the premise that individuals can and do impact the outcome of international negotiations, which should not just be thought of in the abstract as between governments or parties or businesses. As well as discussing useful tools, students will have an opportunity in class to make use of these tools in role plays, and short written assignments. The emphasis is very much on learning through practical experience.The second section of the course will concentrate on third party intervention in international conflicts, and in particular on mediation and problem solving techniques. This will also aim to give you experience of working in small groups on a practical issue in the area of third party problem solving by examining cases in depth.

     LW843      - International Human Rights Law


     
      This module is designed to enable postgraduate students to obtain both essential knowledge of and critical insight into, issues relating to international human rights law. Human rights occupy an extremely important place in contemporary discussions about law, justice and politics at both the domestic and the international level. Across all spheres of government, bodies of law and, pretty much, in every single social mobilization, human rights are invoked and debated. This module approaches the key place occupied by human rights in the contemporary world from an international perspective. The module aims to link the international origins of human rights and the main human rights systems, with the actual practice of human rights. Particular attention is paid in the module to the value, as well as the limits of human rights when they approach, or try to address the problems and the aspirations of five important 'subjects': the Citizen, the Refugee, the Cultural Subject, the Woman and the Poor.The module is organized around lectures and seminars delivered by the convenor, as well as lectures given by invited guests speaker. Guest speakers will explore in their lectures how they have approached in their research and practice the five 'subjects' mentioned above (ie, the Citizen, the Refugee, the Cultural Subject, the Women and the Poor). Emphasis is placed on maximum student participation during seminar discussions for which students will need to prepare. Students are encouraged to develop a critical perspective in light of historical and socio-economic backgrounds.Similar to the module public international law, the teaching, discussions and readings in the module will equip students both with a doctrinal understanding of international human rights law, and with an approach to the field that is grounded in a Critical, Socio-Legal and Law and Humanities perspective.
