Course structure


 We are committed to offering  flexible study options at the School and enable you to tailor your degree to meet your needs by offering start dates in September and January; full- and part-time study; split-site options, and allowing students to combine two fields of study leading to the award of a degree that reflects both disciplines.  

Specialisations

The MA in International Political Economy allows students to choose secondary areas of specialisation from the range of  
programmes offered at BSIS
. Thus, a focused programme of study can be constructed by  studying International Political Economy in the context of International Relations;  Conflict and Security; International Law  and other subject areas we cover. 

This  leads  to the award of an MA degree in, for example, 'International Political Economy with International Law'.

Standard and extended versions  

The LLM is offered in both a standard version (90 ECTS credits) and an extended version (120 ECTS credits) and in each case students may take the programme with or without a secondary specialisation. Those on the extended version will take more modules to gain extra credit.  




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   PO846 - International Political Economy (BSIS)


   
    The globalisation of the international economy has raised key debates about the 'proper' relationship between the economy and society. From outcries about patents for pharmaceutical products in developing countries, to demonstrations outside meetings of the international economic institutions, it is evident that particular visions of political economy are embraced by some, and rejected by others. What should be the 'proper' balance between market rationality and social objectives always has been the fundamental concern of classical political economy. While International Relations appropriated the field of 'International Political Economy' in the 1970s, there is a strong movement to bring the classic philosophical questions of the much older discipline to bear on contemporary global problems, and this is the theme of this course.Such an appreciation cannot be achieved without knowledge of the main theories and debates in International Political Economy as they developed in historical context. This course therefore traces the rise of capitalism as a world system with the practice of Mercantilism and the process of state building; the Liberal-Mercantilist debate of the late 1700s to mid 1800s, the Depression of the 1930s, and the post 1945 liberal international economic order. Structural-dependency theories are examined in the context of the rise of alternatives to the post-war order. With this background, the course examines the evolution of the World Bank in development issues, the evolution of the International Monetary Fund, and the transformation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to the World Trade Organisation. Substantive issues in international trade are examined, such as trade in services, trade in agriculture, trade-related intellectual property rights and trade-related investment measures. The globalisation of foreign direct investment is examined, as well as the relationship between the state and multinational corporations.

   PO881 - State, Market and Society


   
    This module examines the dynamics of political and economic governance.How are capitalism, democracy, constitutional government and the nation-state mutually related as key elements in the developmental model of modern Western societies? How has the particular configuration of these elements ensured the enduring success of these societies? What are the sources of its fragility? Can the model be exported? These questions will be in the focus of our inquiry. In order to be able to answer them, we will venture into broader issues of governance. Thus, the module will engage those key concepts in the analysis of politics that any attempt at conceptualisation is bound to involve  power and authority, governance, sovereignty, the grounds and limits of political obligation, as well as some that are very likely to appear in your writing - freedom, equality, justice and security. You need to be at ease with these concepts in order to write intelligently. You also need to be aware of various approaches in political theorizing in order to master your own scientific imagination. Hence, this module supplies some knowledge of main theoretical perspectives on the relations among state, market and society  in local and global perspectives.

   LW859 - International Economic Regulation


   
    One could define market regulationas the legal form of a political decision to correct the functioning of the market in socially desirable ways. Understood in this way the concept relies on certain key assumptions. It assumes, most importantly, that markets and political communities share the same borders. It also assumes that markets react in predictable ways to legal intervention. It conceives of law as emanating from a monolithic political sovereign. It further carves up the realm of law in a sphere of public, political law intruding upon the market, and private, neutral law facilitating market exchange. Contemporary processes of globalisation and transnationalisation of economic activities and relationships challenge these foundational assumptions. This module seeks to provide an opportunity to work through some of these challenges and to engage critically with their implications for the workings of the so-called global economy.The module focuses on the positioning of international economic regulation as the normative architecture of the contemporary economy. We will explore the processes and actors engaged in the production of international economic regulation, consider debates about the rationales and objectives of international economic regulation, reflect on the sources of authority of international economic regulation and investigate the institutions and instruments that are deployed to address the particular challenges of economic regulation outwith the sovereign state. The module will engage with these general themes and questions at a theoretical and conceptual level and then will seek further to deepen understanding by working through the themes and questions in relation to specific substantive areas of regulation and regulatory processes.

   LW899 - Corporate Governance


   
    In recent years corporate governance - meaning the governance of the large corporations which dominate modern economic life - has emerged as a major area of political and academic interest. Increasing attention has come to be focused, in particular, on the comparative aspects of corporate governance and on the different legal regimes found in different parts of the world, with policy makers striving to determine which regimes are most likely to deliver (so-called) `efficiency' and competitive success. In this context much has been made of the differences between shareholder-oriented, Anglo-American governance regimes and the more inclusive (more stakeholder-oriented) regimes to be found in certain parts of continental Europe and Japan. One result is that the increasing interest in corporate governance has re-opened old questions about the nature of corporations, about the role and duties of corporate managers and about the goal of corporate activities and the interests in which corporations should be run.This module will explore these debates. More generally, the question of corporate governance has become entangled with other important debates, most notably that surrounding the merits (or otherwise) of different models of capitalism: Anglo-American regimes are associated with stock market-based versions of capitalism, while European regimes are associated with so-called welfare-based versions of capitalism.The question of corporate governance has, therefore, become embroiled with debates about the morality and efficiency of different models of capitalism. These too will be explored in this module.

   PO904 - The Politics of International Development


   
    In this module we will interrogate the politics of international development. Politics is about power and we will explore in which ways power works in development, through its historical and contemporary forms, to shape our vision of development. Some issues that we will address are: At the outset development appears to be self-evident objective; most people will agree that we should pursue development, but what do we mean by development, who decides the strategies for development, which voices are heard, which political, social and economic order are we seeking to achieve and who is the object of development? We will analyze discourses of development, their assumptions, objectives, strategies deployed, and institutions involved, and most importantly the concrete effects of thought in development projects. This requires that we learn to read development - whether in its invocation in official speeches or project documents of international development organizations. An important aspect is the ways colonial discourses and practices still continue to shape our ways of perceiving development, establishing categories of the self and the other, represented in photographs, texts, bodies and even religion. Who counts as developed, how do we portray the developed, who is in need of development and who can provide the expertise for development? This is an interdisciplinary module, primarily for students who seek to critically question ways of thinking about development. Our emphasis will be on the need for critical thought as a prerequisite for professional engagement.

   PO924 - Foreign Policy Analysis


   
    The aim of this module is to examine the nature of modern diplomacy and the formulation of foreign policy and relate it to decision-making theories. It examines the global agenda within which foreign policy takes place. Starting with an analysis of the role of foreign policy in different conceptual approaches to IR, it analyses bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, the range of foreign policy options, forms of cooperation, diplomacy, coercive diplomacy and imperialism. It examines the relationship between truth (academics) and power (practitioners). Although there is a strong conceptual input nevertheless there is plenty of room for relating these to current empirical examples.

   PO925 - Histories of International Conflict


   
    Why have the 20th and the start of the 21st centuries been so conflict-ridden, despite efforts by governments to establish international organizations and mechanisms to preserve peace? To answer this question, one must take into account the empirical studies and theoretical approaches that form the basis of international conflict and security studies. Especially important are comparative analyses of the origins and causes of inter-state conflicts since 1914. However, such studies assume a certain measure of historical knowledge of the political, economic, and ideological background to, influence on, and consequences of, not only of the 20th- and 21st-century conflicts being analyzed, but also of selected conflicts from earlier historical epochs. Such studies also require some knowledge of the diplomatic and military history of these same conflicts. This module, then, will focus on the historical context of selected international conflicts with the objective of enabling graduate students pursuing degrees in International Relations (IA) and International Conflict and Security (ICS) to gain an understanding of the complexity, nature, and dynamics of those conflicts.

   PO929 - Development: Theory and Practice


   
    This module focuses on the politics of global poverty. It seeks to analyze contemporary formations of poverty in the Global South, but also in advanced economies to explore causes, patterns and approaches for addressing poverty and related inequalities. To investigate how poverty is governed, we will primarily focus on three structuring forces: capitalism, law and geography. For each of them, we will analyze how they have the potential to generate, but also regulate and contain poverty and inequalities. Hence our task is to understand different ways of governing poverty in various societies. Starting with questions of social justice, global justice and global citizenship, we will use the exclusion and inclusion on the one hand and political, economic and social order on the other to frame our analysis of the following issues: politics of poverty, economic and financial inclusion/exclusion, urban geographies of inclusion/exclusion and legal techniques of inclusion/exclusion. To understand the diversity of poverties, we explore their plural forms by drawing upon various cases across the globe, and highlighting the effects of crosscutting issues, such as gender and race inequalities. We will integrate the variety of actors in the field of global poverty, including global development agencies and specialized agencies, such as the World Bank, UN Habitat and UNDP, but also include the role of regulation and welfare attributed to governments, NGOs and social movements. This module will provide a multidisciplinary approach to global poverty, and include theoretical and practical elements. We will use academic literature, program and policy documents, case studies and workshops to explore global poverty.

   PO930 - Security and Liberties


   
    What are contemporary security concerns and what effects do they have on liberties? After 9/11 a number of security measures have been introduced in the name of protection. The search for security has led many governments to restrict liberties for selective populations (i.e. suspected of terrorism and unauthorized migration), but also to increase surveillance measures and curtail liberties as part of everyday rule applicable to the general population. This module seeks to tackle contemporary questions of security and liberties and highlights specifically terrorism and liberties, migration and security, and general surveillance. Topics range from indefinite detention, policing, airport security, biometrics to video-surveillance. Discussions of contemporary issues are employed to understand some of the inherent problems of liberal democracies in the search for a balance of security and liberties. Part I will provide an introduction into theorizing security and the relation of security and liberties. How can the liberal state deal with its enemies? Do exceptional times require exceptional measures? Should governments suspend rights and liberties of individuals to preserve the constitution and protect the liberal order? Can and how can the liberal paradox be resolved? Is there a right balance between security and liberties? Under which circumstances should fundamental rights be restricted? Part I will discuss the relation of security and liberties from political, legal and sociological perspectives and highlight debates on exceptionalism and the rule.Part II will analyze specific contemporary issues, seeking to combine problematics of security and liberties for selective populations and general populations. Topics include terrorism and liberties, policing and criminalization, borders and biometrics, and surveillance technologies. The contemporary issues were chosen with the intent to provide students to the breadth of contemporary issues that can be analyzed through the lens of security and liberties. Part II includes policy documents, court cases, film/arts, and current newspaper articles and journals.

     PO932      - International Relations Theory


     
      Whenever we make a statement about international affairs, we rely on certain (often implicit) theoretical assumptions: about power, interests, identities, norms and how they relate to the behaviour of international actors. Whether we like it or not, we are doomed to rely on theories. The starting-point of this course is not that theories are the only possible and all-encompassing approach to the study of international affairs, but that they are helpful to understand, compare and critically evaluate interpretations of international issues: if we all use theoretical assumptions, we better make them explicit and understood, to make sure what exactly we are claiming.International Relations (IR) theories are not approached as strict categories with clear boundaries, but rather as a continuously evolving debate. The course does not attempt to give an encyclopedic overview of all theories of International Relations, but rather to confront different views. The main objective is to understand the core differences between different theoretical approaches. Inevitably, the presentation of IR theories in this course is only one way of telling the story, one of the possible ways of classifying IR theories. The course starts by raising the problem of perception in International Relations and introducing key questions behind IR theories. Classical Realism and Structural Realism are the first theories on which we focus in depth. Next, Liberalism is covered. The course continues to focus on the neo-neo debate between Neo-realism and Neo-liberalism. Both  dominant schools have been challenged by Constructivism for their rationalist assumptions. The course sheds light on consistent and moderate forms of Constructivism. The next session deals with Marxist theories (old and new) and Critical Theory.The following part of the course adds a more thematic approach, looking at different issues from the angle of different theories. First the focus is on international cooperation and international regimes. After that, the impact of norms in international relations is debated. At this point normative theories and the English School are introduced. Finally, we look beyond the conventional perspectives, highlighting non-Western theories, post-modern theories and feminist IR theories.Towards the end of the course, we return to the big debates and dividing lines in IR, drawing attention to the fact that the way in which we classify theories is not a neutral art, but rather a continuous game of positioning, promoting and marginalising ideas. Finally, we engage with current debates on post-Cold War (dis)order and globalization. Here we leave the trodden paths of different theoretical schools and present conflicting views of international affairs today for further debate.The course keeps a close link to current or historical international events, avoiding (to paraphrase Hannah Arendt) that because of our love for theories, we would end up living in a defactualised world. Therefore lectures, literature and seminars will also touch upon tangible issues, such as power, security, the role of the state, human rights, etc. Moreover, several debates on hot topics in world affairs are featuring throughout different sessions. To fulfill the objective of introducing theories, critically analyzing them in depth, and learning how to apply them, the reading lists contain different sorts of texts: introductory texts, classics and advanced applications of theories to topical issues.

     PO933      - Theories of Conflict and Violence


     
      Theories of International Conflict is designed to examine the various approaches that have been developed to understand conflict in its different forms with a particular focus on contemporary research on the causes, effects and dynamics of intrastate conflicts and civil wars. The module will also provide an opportunity to examine emerging approaches to conflict and to look at the extent to which theory is evolving to keep up with rapid changes in different conflict environments. To this end, students will be required for their final assessment to examine the relevance of the various theories of international conflict for understanding an existing conflict.

      The module explores the different ways in which actors have been conceptualizing and seeking to deal with contemporary international conflicts and security threats. The module highlights the growing interplay of security and conflict-related issues, as exemplified in the Afghan and Iraqi examples.The module is divided in three main sections. First, we explore a series of international security issues, and how these are dealt with at the international level. The stress will be put on how these security issues, such as international criminal networks, feed into the dynamics of current conflicts. Second, we examine a variety of contemporary methods of conflict management, from conflict prevention and early warning to negotiation and mediation and state-building. Third, we focus on the key question of how do conflicts end, and examine the issue of the durability of peace agreements as well as that of the successes and failures of truth-telling and reconciliation processes.

      This module has an historical dimension, which serves as a background to a political analysis of the United Nations system, including its member states and the role of non-state actors therein. It considers the role of the UN in the area of peace and security, including peacekeeping, as well as the attempts of the global multilateral system to come to terms with the twenty-first century, including tackling sustainable development challenges like climate change. This takes us into efforts at UN reform, such as those emanating from the Millennium Summit of 2000, the World Summit of 2005, the Rio+20 conference of 2012 and the Sustainable Development Summit of 2015. Globalisation comes to the fore as a major factor shaping the global agenda. The issue of global leaders - and followers - allows us a speculative glance into the future.

      This module will begin by outlining key issues relating to migration in the context of nationalism, national identity and belonging/membership. It will explore the definitions of each of these terms from a variety of theoretical/disciplinary perspectives. The interactions between the three will be examined as well. In so doing, the module will look at diaspora groups, immigrant groups, non-migrant populations and minorities. Developing and developed countries will both be discussed, while minorities such as African-Americans in the United States as well as Hungarians in Romania will be included. Sociological, political science and legal perspectives will be emphasized.

     PO940      - Theories of Migration, Integration and Citizenship


     
      Migration is a field of many questions  we investigate fascinating puzzles and seek explanations for migratory phenomena. We do not always find answers, but sometimes many more questions. Therein lies part of its attraction. It is through theories that we can begin to make sense of the puzzles. We will do precisely that in this module. This module will take you on this exploratory path and help you understand what lies behind one of the world's most significant contemporary issues.While migration is often discussed at a policy level, rarely is it examined on a theoretical level. Examining theories and applying them to specific cases can help us disentangle the complexities of migrant integration, movement and citizenship. This module thus seeks to establish a fundamental understanding of the explanatory theories relevant for the movement of peoples (immigration), the processes of incorporation (integration, assimilation, multiculturalism) and the different aspects of citizenship/inclusion. We will discuss both classic theories and the evolution of these theories today, reading both original theorists and contemporary analyses of classic theories.The module will start with an examination of theories of immigration, moving on to investigate different approaches to integration, including individuals or groups who are excluded or who choose to remain separate. The module will then move on to discuss different aspects of citizenship. While formal citizenship once defined membership, holding a passport today has declined in significance in terms of the rights it offers. The boundaries between citizens and non-citizen residents have thus become increasingly blurred. We will conclude the module with the increasingly important - and highly-debated - concept of transnationalism. The implications of these developments will be explored as well.

      Migrants or Refugees? That's a question that has been much in the news in the late summer and early fall of 2015 as Syrian asylum-seekers come to Europe  and is an important one. Which term is used has both legal and public opinion repercussions. In this module, we will examine and discuss the wide diversity of migration across the world. In order to do so, we will use the tripartite lens of conflict, state control and human rights. We will consider many of the contradictions and puzzles which arise from migration, seeking to arrive at a deeper understanding of this widespread human phenomenon  which is, at the same time, highly politically contested. We will examine the diversity of migration through broad policy categories, but also through challenging assumptions.

     PO944      - Gender and Conflicts


     
      This module will explore the various intersections between gender and conflict: how masculinities and femininities are constructed in times of conflict and war, the impact of these constructions within the conflict/post-conflict context, and how gender and ethnicity are used in narratives and political discourses. We will discuss the relationships between gender, militarism and war, between gender and power, and more generally between gender and social structures. The goal for this course is to analyse the relationship between conflict and gender. This course also aims at understanding the differing impact of conflict on women and on men and the diverging meanings of conflict and security for women and men.Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, norms, and so forth, which affect how both males and females, or rather how masculinities and femininities are defined or understood within society. A gender relations approach examines the interplay between masculinities and femininities. While feminism increased the attention to gender-related issues, most notably in regards to females, more recent men and masculinities research has offered a complementary understanding of how gender and gender relations affect us all. Conflict-related policies such as UNSC 1325, and more generally the broader focus on gender mainstreaming, gender specialists and gender trainers, have further emphasised its centrality to conflict research. The changing nature of conflict itself, including civilians increasingly being targeted, rape as a weapon of war, and both female and male combatants, necessitates a more complex approach, which takes gender into account.

The course then offers an in depth discussion of each policy phase in the cycle, highlighting key theoretical and empirical contributions relevant to the policy phase under scrutiny. The course offers students a framework to conduct their own research on a policy or policy reform/change.

     PO948      - Europe and Global Change


     
      This course offers an International Relations perspective on one of todays crucial challenges: how is Europes role in the world changing? It starts from the idea that the economic globalisation of the last decades is increasingly translated into new political structures. The centres of gravity are shifting, new players have arisen and new challenges have emerged. Inevitably this changes the position of Europe. At the heart of the course is the interaction between the regional and the global: changes within Europe are affected by global change, but also impact on global developments.Europe appears in its many different disguises, both as integrated and as fragmented Europe. We deal with different regional organisations in wider Europe: the European Union, NATO, the Council of Europe, but also post-Soviet organisations. But equally we treat the role of other actors, such as states, so that Europe appears in its multi-dimensional complex forms, with all the ambiguities resulting from this.According to Chakrabarty (2007) Europe has already been provincialised by history itself and the challenge is to provincialise the very idea of Europe (often amalgamated with that of the West): the ideas of modernity that continue to be influential worldwide and make it hard to escape Eurocentrism. Therefore it is crucial to study this interpenetration between the regional and the global  in its different dimensions: power, interests, identity, ideas, perception, institutions.Cases and examples are taken from different fields, such as foreign policy, security, trade or environmental policy. Specific attention is given to fields where certain European actors claim leadership, such as democracy promotion or climate change, as well as fields where European actors feel particularly challenged, for example energy security.The module seeks to confront different opinions, allowing students to approach these issues in a critical and balanced way.

     PO949      - EU Politics and Governance (Brussels)


     
      This course seeks to give students an advanced understanding of the functioning of the European institutions and politics of EU policy-making. The course has a double focus. First, it deals with the formal role of institutions and actors in the EU. Secondly, it focuses on the politics and governance structures in the EU. It looks into power and influence, interests, coalition formation, balancing, bargaining, policy networks and multilevel governance, as well as issues of identity and perception. In doing so, this course wants to enable students to understand and critically analyse the way in which policies are made in the European Union and the implications thereof. The seminars deal both with academic debates on the most salient topics and with specific cases. As to the latter, a specific case of policy-making will be studied by going through the stages of the policy cycle. We also discuss the conclusions of the most recent European Council meeting and detect political motivations and mechanisms behind it. These cases allow students to come to grips with both the formal competencies and political factors that influence the decision-making process. The course is concluded by a research-based simulation game at COREPER level. Students play the role of member states. For the simulation students have to do autonomous research to prepare their national position. This research will mainly be based on online research of official documents and databases. The purpose is for students to be able to retrieve and analyse relevant information and to understand the practicalities of decision-making, it complexity and political character.

     LW916      - European Union International Relations Law


     
      This module explores the external relations law of the European Union with third countries and international organisations. This is an increasingly important area given that the EU has evolved into the largest regional trading and political bloc on the world stage. Having focused initially on developing a common trading policy with the international community, since the early 1990s the EU has steadily broadened the range of its powers to be able to engage in political as well as military issues on the international scene. A significant milestone was the formal establishment of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. More recently, the Lisbon Treaty 2007 further enhanced the EU's role in foreign affairs through a series of institutional changes and innovations, notably including the introduction of the 'External Action Service', which is the EU counterpart to national diplomatic services, and the Unions High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The module will critically explore the following aspects in particular:  1. The institutional and core legal framework of EU external relations law, including the division of competences between the EU and the Member States, the impact of human rights in EU external relations and the expansion of the EU powers over time;2. Selected specific policy areas, such as the Common Commercial Policy, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the external dimension to EU environmental policy, along with their different (and sometimes conflicting) objectives and underlying political perspectives. The module will also foster a contextual, interdisciplinary and critical approach to studying the subject, with reference to political science literature on the effects of EU external policies.

     PO814      - European Foreign and Security Policy in the  21st Century


     
      This course focuses on contemporary security issues facing Europe today and on how the EU and its member states are adapting to its new role in providing security beyond its territory. The creation of the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) and the increasing number of crisis management operations since 2003 raise important issues over the EUs performance in foreign and security policy; the creation of a European strategy and strategic culture; and changing relations with NATO but also the United States. The course will thus examine the institutions of EU foreign and security policy; the future of the transatlantic relationship in light of the 2003 split over Iraq; the future of NATO; inter-institutional cooperation between the EU and the UN; EU relations with other international partners; regional challenges such as integrating the Balkans and solving the frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union; and engaging in theatres further abroad such as Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the course is to give students a thorough overview of contemporary security issues and how they are addressed by European  and international security- institutions. Lectures will provide a conceptual overview of the most important topics, whereas seminars will discuss specific case studies to illustrate concepts and themes addressed in lectures.

     LW883      - International Law of the Sea


     
      Starting from the principle of the freedom of the high seas, this course will address the different maritime zones existing today, which all possess a distinct legal regime: the internal waters, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf, the Area, and the high seas. Since all these maritime zones, in one way or another, fall back on the baseline for their measurement and often need to be delimited in case of adjacent or opposite states, introductory chapters on both issues are provided. Special attention is finally also devoted to marine pollution, the living resources of the high seas, two topical issues in the contemporary law of the sea, as well as the articles of the above mentioned convention of 1982 on the settlement of disputes, because this was the first multilateral agreement which incorporated such a detailed procedure for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

     HI825      - Total War 1914-1945


     
      First World War gave birth to the concept of total war; the Second World War became the paradigmatic instance of this new kind of warfare. Both military conflicts reveal a novel trend towards a total mobilisation of society and global, unrestricted warfare against enemy armies and populations. This module examines the experience of war in the light on the concepts implications, in particular the erosion of the boundaries between military and civilian spheres and targets. The structure of the module follows the chronology of the events. It looks at WWI and WWII, as well as total ideologies such as Fascism and Communism, the impact of the era of total war on international relations, the emergence and rule of authoritarian (military) dictatorships, possible parallels with colonial rule and the topics of genocide and the Shoah (Holocaust). The second part of this module also tackles contemporary legacies: the diverse (political, social, technical etc.) impact of total war, transitional justice, historical interpretations, current day presence and collective memories.

     LW843      - International Human Rights Law


     
      This module is designed to enable postgraduate students to obtain both essential knowledge of and critical insight into, issues relating to international human rights law. Human rights occupy an extremely important place in contemporary discussions about law, justice and politics at both the domestic and the international level. Across all spheres of government, bodies of law and, pretty much, in every single social mobilization, human rights are invoked and debated. This module approaches the key place occupied by human rights in the contemporary world from an international perspective. The module aims to link the international origins of human rights and the main human rights systems, with the actual practice of human rights. Particular attention is paid in the module to the value, as well as the limits of human rights when they approach, or try to address the problems and the aspirations of five important 'subjects': the Citizen, the Refugee, the Cultural Subject, the Woman and the Poor.The module is organized around lectures and seminars delivered by the convenor, as well as lectures given by invited guests speaker. Guest speakers will explore in their lectures how they have approached in their research and practice the five 'subjects' mentioned above (ie, the Citizen, the Refugee, the Cultural Subject, the Women and the Poor). Emphasis is placed on maximum student participation during seminar discussions for which students will need to prepare. Students are encouraged to develop a critical perspective in light of historical and socio-economic backgrounds.Similar to the module public international law, the teaching, discussions and readings in the module will equip students both with a doctrinal understanding of international human rights law, and with an approach to the field that is grounded in a Critical, Socio-Legal and Law and Humanities perspective.

     LW844      - Legal Aspects of Contemporary International Problems


     
      There are a number of ways to approach the field of international law. It can be treated doctrinally as a system of rules from various sources  such as treaties, state practices that are seen to have the binding force of law, and general principles shared across domestic jurisdictions  built up over time to regulate interactions between states and other entities. It can be studied as a historical phenomenon, emerging from out of a colonial history with contemporary implications. It can also be studied as an (imperfect) approach to addressing international 'problems', placing international law in broader social, political, and historical contexts as one possible source of 'solutions'. This course highlights international laws limits and possibilities in relation to a set of contemporary inter- and trans-national concerns, including the use of armed force, responses to emerging security threats, and unresolved territorial disputes. It focuses on key themes of international law, such as sovereignty, statehood, self-determination, and the regulation of armed conflict, drawing upon perspectives from the humanities and the interpretive social sciences. It explores these overlapping themes as they emerge across several issues and case studies, bringing international law into a relationship with contemporary geopolitics, political theory, and the fields historical inheritance. Along the way, we will address philosophical and theoretical questions such as the binding character of international law, problems of representation and interpretation, and the rhetorical dimensions of customary international law. Topics covered The topics covered vary year to year to align with changing circumstances and also according to student interest, but are anticipated to be as follows:- The use of force and the law of armed conflict - Reframing sovereignty: the responsibility to protect- Regulating the global arms trade- Targeted killing- Enforcing the prohibition against torture- Border conflicts and colonial legacies in international law

      This module is intended specifically for students following the LLM programmes. It aims to highlight how International Relations theory can contribute to a better understanding of the international context in which international law is made and how both interact.The question whether international rules determine the behaviour of states or whether they are only marginally significant, is at the heart of the International Relations debate. In the same way, the question why and under which circumstances states engage into international cooperation and sign treaties divides theoretical schools. So does the question whether international law is mainly an expression of the status quo, confirming existing relations of power, or whether international law is on the contrary a force of change, steering international relations in a certain direction.

      Object of this module is the formulation and implementation of political strategy in a variety of fields: from military strategy, to policy strategy, advocacy, lobbying, and electoral mobilisation. In the first part of the module, students will be introduced to the policy process at national, EU and international level. Students will also become familiar with a number of concepts and theoretical tools for the analysis of political strategies actors use to influence the policy process. In the second part of the module, there will be a brief introduction to political marketing and campaign management. This module will not deal with electoral mobilisation is detail as a module is dedicated to this topic in the autumn term. We will then address strategic and crisis-management communication. This will be followed by a crisis communication workshop, in which students will examine the manner in which political leaders and the media have handled a crisis situation (e.g. the 9/11 terrorist attacks). Some of the sessions in this part will be offered by policy practitioners to allow students a hands-on experience of the design and application of political strategy. Our quests will be Mr Jamie Shea, Director of Policy Planning in the Private Office of NATO Secretary General, and Mr Russell Patten, Chief Executive, Grayling Political Strategy.

     PO848      - Negotiation and Mediation


     
      This module explores the way in which violent conflict can be resolved peacefully. Focusing predominately on negotiation (bi-lateral discussions) and mediation (third party led dialogue) we discuss both the practical and theoretical aspects of peace processes. The aim is to provide an overview of the main problems negotiators face when attempting to resolve incompatibilities between individuals or groups. In addition to the theoretical discussion focused on case studies and systematic empirical research, we also develop practical skills of course participants by using a range of simulation exercises. The course has two main sections. The first section is focused on negotiation and is designed to teach practical negotiating skills using the Harvard Negotiation method. This is based on the premise that individuals can and do impact the outcome of international negotiations, which should not just be thought of in the abstract as between governments or parties or businesses. As well as discussing useful tools, students will have an opportunity in class to make use of these tools in role plays, and short written assignments. The emphasis is very much on learning through practical experience.The second section of the course will concentrate on third party intervention in international conflicts, and in particular on mediation and problem solving techniques. This will also aim to give you experience of working in small groups on a practical issue in the area of third party problem solving by examining cases in depth.

      What good are great ideas if one cannot communicate them? Politics is nothing without the ability to persuade others which is precisely what you will learn (theoretically and practically) in this module. A core module in the MA in Political Strategy and Communication (and an option for students in other Masters programmes), P0868 begins by considering several theories of political communication, political rhetoric and media theory. Using these as a springboard, we will focus on those key techniques used by all savvy political communicators: framing, spinning, cherry-picking etc. Throughout the semester, we turn to in-depth case studies which will provide us with ample opportunities to practice those skills one cannot get ahead in politics without: critical analysis, presentations, debate and persuasive speaking skills.

     SO880      - Humanitarian Issues in Forced Migration


     
      In Autumn 2015, Europe is seeing more forced migration than it has since World War II. Syrian refugees - and others - seeking to find a place of refuge need far more than just a legal status as refugee. That is just the beginning. What about family reunification for families that have been divided? Employment, school for children? This module focuses on forced migration more broadly, looking beyond those few (globally speaking) who are granted refugee status, looking at rescue at sea and what humanitarian agencies can do. The module looks at deportation and return, for those not granted leave to stay, and at the protection gap for those individuals. It also engages with the questions of integration, as well as mental health issues for forced migrants and at trafficking of human beings.

     PO997      - Dissertation in Politics and International Relations


     
      The module is built around 12 lectures and 12 seminars, delivered bi-weekly over the course of two terms.  The coursework covers the ontological, epistemological, and methodological issues in the social sciences; the main approaches to social science (for instances, including but not limited to foundationalism, realism, materialism, objectivism, anti-foundationalism, poststructuralism, subjectivism, empiricism, positivism, phenomenology, and constructivism); analytical approaches (such as dependent and independent variables, causality, and constitutive theory), and modes of reasoning (deduction, induction) and levels of analysis (agency, structure, co-determination).  As the module is team taught by a range of staff at BSIS with different disciplinary approaches, the module then will demonstrate how these concepts are used differently in different subject-specific contexts which represent the main fields of inquiry at BSIS, including legal analysis, political analysis, historical analysis, and economic analysis.  The module then moves on to practical questions of research and writing the dissertation, including the construction of the Dissertation Proposal and the Dissertation itself, the use of research materials (qualitative and quantitative data), using research and resources (libraries, documentation, and the internet); and drafting and writing, including the use of appropriate academic style and format.
