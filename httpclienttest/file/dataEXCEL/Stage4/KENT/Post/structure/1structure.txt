   MA726 - Finance and Financial Reporting


   
    This module provides an introduction to the principles of corporate finance and financial reporting. It is intended for students of Finance and Actuarial Science and is available to students in other programmes where a basic knowledge of financial markets, financial accounting and reporting is needed. The syllabus introduces and develops the concepts and elements of corporate finance including a knowledge of the instruments used by companies to raise finance and manage financial risk, introduces the concepts and techniques of financial accounting and enables students to understand and interpret critically financial reports of companies and financial institutions including financial statements used by pension funds and insurance companies.

   MA319 - Probability and Statistics for Actuarial Science


   
    The module will introduce the student to the basic concepts of probability and statistics, with applications to a variety of topics illustrated with real data. The techniques that are discussed can be used in their own right to solve simple problems, but also serve as an important foundation for later, more advanced, modules. After dealing with key ideas in probability theory, the module will cover descriptive statistics, before moving on to statistical inference - the science of drawing conclusions from data. A brief introduction to statistical computing will be included. Outline syllabus includes: Concepts and axioms of probability; marginal, conditional and joint probabilities; Bayes' theorem; discrete and continuous random variables; expectation; common distributions; numerical summaries of data; sampling distributions; point estimation; interval estimation and hypothesis tests; association between variables; goodness of fit.Marks on this module can count towards exemption from the professional examination CT3 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

   MA501 - Statistics for Insurance


   
    This module covers aspects of Statistics which are particularly relevant to insurance. Some topics (such as risk theory and credibility theory) have been developed specifically for actuarial use.

   MA529 - Probability and Statistics for Actuarial Science 2


   
    This module develops the techniques introduced in MA319. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations. The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module. Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing. All of these have been introduced in MA319. The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation. Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, cumulant generating functions etc. The Poisson process. Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables. Random number simulation. Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution. Principles of statistical inference. Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency). Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments. Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test. Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.  Statistical inference for the slope and intercept parameters in simple linear regression.  One-way ANOVA.Marks on this module can count towards examption from the professional examination CT3 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
