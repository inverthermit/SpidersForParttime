   SA806 - Social Science Perspectives on Environmental Issues


   
    This module aims to widen students' knowledge of a variety of topical and/or scientifically important or controversial environmental issues, to encourage students to look at environmental studies from the perspectives of the several social science disciplines (anthropology, law, political science, social policy, and sociology), to make connections between questions stimulated by their own individual disciplinary backgrounds and those raised in the course, and to reflect critically upon the advantages and limitations of the various perspectives. The module covers a variety of topics which are likely to include: the nature of environmental issues; the social construction of risk and the precautionary principle; global warming, climate change and energy policy; the rise of environmental consciousness and environmentalism; food and agriculture; environmental policy and regulation; environmental policy and law; ecotourism; ecology and development; traditional societies and sustainability.

   SA803 - Politics and Sociology of the Environment


   
    This module is particularly concerned with the forms and outcomes of the political contention and mobilisation around environmental issues, ranging from pressure groups, formal environmental movement organisations and Green parties to local environmental activism and radical environmental protest. It also considers the relationship between democracy and the environment: is democracy good for the environment? Would more deliberative forms of democracy improve matters? The approach is cross-nationally comparative and will also consider issues of global environmental politics.

   SE831 - Environmental Anthropology


   
    This module introduces some of the main theoretical approaches and some practical applications of the study of environmental anthropology (in particular, the cultural ecology of Steward, the concepts of carrying capacity and limiting factors as used in eco-systematic models, historical and political ecology, and new approaches deriving from post-modern anthropology). It considers some of the main cultural and social aspects of the human-environment interface, such as the relationship between social organisation and ecology; alternative forms of land use and management; the impact of processes of globalization on human interactions with the environment in a number of non-western societies; and the cultural dimension of human adaptation to the environment. The middle section of the module looks at five categories of subsistence strategy and the environments they occur in, foraging and hunting (in arid, arctic and tropical forest ecosystems), fishing (coastal marine environments), pastoralism (in grassland and arid ecosystems), low intensity and high intensity agriculture (in arid, grassland and tropical environments).  For each of these production systems we will also examine a complementary contemporary issue in conservation and/or development. These issues may involve great debates in theory, problems of methodology or issues in applying research results to solve practical problems.  Throughout the module we address methods and problems of applying research in environmental anthropology to related development, conservation and human rights issues, and in particular this year we look at adaptation to climate change among Indigenous peoples.Week 1  Theory and Explanation in Environmental Anthropology: Wildlife TradeWeek 2  Human-Nature Relationships: Cultural EcologyWeek 3  Ecological Anthropology: Complex Adaptive SystemsWeek 4  Historical Ecology: The evolution of Biocultural diversity?Week 5  Political Ecology and Environmental DegradationWeek 6  Discursive Approaches: EnvironmentalismsWeek 7  Foraging societies, hunters, and the bushmeat tradeWeek 8  Fishers, Sea Tenure, and Common Property RightsWeek 9  Pastoralists, Grasslands and Protected AreasWeek 10 Low Intensity Agricultural Systems: Swidden SystemsWeek 11 High Intensity Agricultural Systems, the Green Revolution and GM cropsWeek 12 Climate Change: Studying local knowledge and responses

   SO832 - Techniques of Data Analysis


   
    This course provides students with the understanding and skills necessary to use research, whether within a research career or outside of it.  Building on other training in the details of specific methods, it focuses on two sets of broader questions.  Firstly, it looks at uncertainty in social research  how confident are we about what we know?  In answering this question it looks at issues of quality in qualitative and quantitative research, the difficulties of causal inference and generalisation, coming to conclusions from research reviews, and philosophical issues around truth and values.  Secondly, it looks at the link between research and action.  In doing this, it goes from the very practical (how to ensure that your research is used by policymakers and/or practitioners, and to deal with the political pressures on researchers) to the conceptual (in what ways does evidence get used by wider society?) to the normative (should researchers be critical, and if so, what are their ethical obligations in doing this?).

   LW837 - Conservation and Natural Resources Law


   
    The conservation and sustainable use of living natural resources or biodiversity represents a key element in securing the overarching environmental policy objective of sustainable development.  Globally, the protection of the world's endangered species, habitats and ecosystems is becoming an ever more urgent task.  The module traces the historical progression from approaches based on property rights, welfare based legislation to more genuinely conservation oriented laws.  From early national legislation concerned with the direct protection of wildlife and the protection of ecologically important habitats the module turns to look at ecological law from broader European Union and global international perspectives.  Discussions of the EU Wild Birds and Habitats Directives, and the Biodiversity Convention  are used to illustrate some of the key legal features in biodiversity conservation law.  Concluding sessions examine the international trade dimension of conservation law and the protection of fishery resources.  The module explores some of the challenges of regulating and managing dynamic ecosystems and the implications of regulation for landholders and those engaged in wildlife exploitation.  Topics Covered The Legal Status of Natural Resources  The Direct Protection of Species and Institutional Responsibilities The Protection of Habitats The European Union Wild Birds Directive The European Union Habitats Directive Implementation of European Union Conservation Legislation International Trade and Nature Conservation The Tragedy of the Commons: Fisheries Resources

   LW838 - Land Development Law


   
    The regulation of land development and land use is a key element in the legal response to the need to protect the environment and to secure broader environmental policy objectives such as sustainable development and the enhancement of biodiversity.  Development places perhaps the greatest stress on natural resources and environmental quality. In many legal systems the decision to grant development consent is critical. This module considers the role of strategic and specific planning controls in preventing and mitigating environmental harm.  This module provides discussion of private law forms of land use control and of current debates in property law about restraining owners' rights because of social constraints such as environmental protection, and also the impact of human rights laws which seek to protect property rights from undue state interference. There is a strong emphasis on those legal forms which are found both internationally and across jurisdictions, in particular environmental assessment.  Particular attention is given to the European Union Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive, and the difficulties in implementing these that have arisen in the member states.  Topics Covered Private Control of Land Development  Public Law Origins of Land Use Regulation Land Development and Human Rights Development Planning  Development Control  Planning Conditions and Obligations  The EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive  Implementation of Environmental Impact Assessment  The EU Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive

   LW841 - International Trade Law and the Environment


   
    The law relating to international trade and the environment represents a key element in the legal response to the need to protect the environment and to secure broader environmental policy objectives such as sustainable development. Whilst these are central elements in the Environmental Law and Policy Programme, they are also of considerable relevance to students following Programmes in International Commercial Law, Public International Law and European Law given the importance of environmental regulation in different areas of international law. The module has been structured to provide a balanced coverage of the international rules and institutions which address the relationship between freedom of trade and environmental protection.  Within this structure, illustrations are provided of many of the key areas in case studies on topical and contentious issues.Topics Covered introduction to the law and economics of environmental protection and economic liberalization  introduction to the law and institutions of the World Trade Organisation  GATT 1994 and the protection of the environment  the SPS Agreement, the TBT Agreement and the protection of human, animal and plant life and health  TRIPS, biotechnology and biological diversity GATS and the environment MEAS and the WTO  Doha negotiations on trade and environment case studies: tuna/dolphins, shrimp/turtles, asbestos, beef/hormones, genetically modified products

   LW852 - European Community Environmental Law and Policy


   
    This module provides an overview of the policy and legislation of the European Union in relation to the environment and ecological protection, with particular sectors considered in more detail in other environmental modules. The overall purpose of the module is to appreciate the significance of European Union law as a system of regional international law seeking to harmonize the national laws of the Member States according to common principles of environmental regulation. An initial focus is upon foundational issues including the nature of the European Union, basic principles of European Union environmental policy and law, and problematic issues such as the tension between free trade and environmental protection. Attention is also given to particular examples of environmental measures, with some discussion of how these are implemented in national law. Finally, discussion is provided as to recent and forthcoming developments at European Union level, including critical issues of participation, implementation and enforcement, at European Union and national levels.Topics covered introductory session: a scan of the module the evolution of European Union environmental competence fundamental environmental objectives of the European Union the basis for substantive environmental legislation reconciling environmental protection and trade  substantive European Union legislation on waste regulation environmental information and participation alternative strategies in environmental regulation the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation

     SO833      - Design, Philosophy and Ethics of Social   Inquiry


     
      Module Summary: This module aims to provide students with the skills to develop a research idea and to turn this into a coherent, achievable  and interesting!  research proposal.  The course will be particularly useful for those doing empirical research in their MSc or PhD dissertation, or who will use social research after their studies.In developing these skills, the course also provides an introduction to research methods and methodological debates.  It will cover:1. Key skills in research design  developing a research question; writing a research proposal; and real-world considerations like ethics, cost, and feasibility;2. Qualitative research design  an overview of different types of qualitative methods and the logic of qualitative design; when to apply qualitative methods; and key design issues such as choosing cases and planning qualitative analysis;3. Quantitative research design  an introduction to the logic of quantitative research, and key issues such as turning the social world into numbers; when to apply quantitative methods; issues surrounding generalisation; how to interpret quantitative analysis results, and an introduction to the most common form of quantitative analysis;4. Mixed-methods designs, which combine qualitative and quantitative research. This course is complementary to the specialist courses in doing qualitative (SO817) and quantitative (SO819) research, and the course Using Social Research  Advanced Critical Skills (SO832).

     SO998      - Dissertation


     
      The aims of this module are twofold:First, to provide students with the opportunity to independently carry out an in-depth inquiry to investigate a research question(s) of their choice, producing a coherent review of the relevant literature, a logical discussion and a clearly communicated set of conclusions in the form of a dissertation.Second, to prepare students to become research-minded practitioners in order that they have the capacity to undertake research in practice settings and/or take a lead role in supervising others in such work.The following represents the likely format for curriculum delivery:In mid-November, there will be a two-hour workshop, which will outline the aims, the structure, the process of the dissertation. During the spring term, the students will finalise their proposal with their chosen supervisor. If the dissertation requires ethical research approval, an application will be submitted to the school research ethics committee by the beginning of the summer term. During the summer term and vacation, students will meet their supervisor every fortnight to discuss the progress of their dissertation. The supervisors will provide feedback on written work and will set monthly work plans and targets for the students. The dissertation topic will relate to a key question, issue and problem within social science.
