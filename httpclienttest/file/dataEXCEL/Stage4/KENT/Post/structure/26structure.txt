Course structure


 This programme provides a broad coverage of computer networks, computer security and mobile device technologies. It looks in depth at some of the security issues that fixed and wireless networks are subject to, and the current solutions employed to address these problems. This course will appeal to computing graduates seeking careers in the network or network security industries, or those who wish to carry on with this topic as an area of research.

All taught Master's programmes at Canterbury are available with an optional industrial placement or may be combined with a Pre-Master's course to form an International Master's programme.




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   CO838 - Internet of Things and Mobile Devices


   
    The module will cover a mixture of theoretical and practical topics in the area of mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), that is, the use of Internet technologies to access and interact with objects in the physical world. This will include coverage of the range of sensor and actuator devices available, ways in which they communicate and compute, methods for getting information to and from IoT-enabled devices, ways of visualising and processing data gained from the IoT, and associated privacy and security issues. A practical component will consist of building the hardware and software for a sensor network and a system to visualise data from that network.  Application development for mobile devices such as smartphones will also be introduced using a popular mobile platform.

   CO880 - Project and Dissertation


   
    Students choose their project near the beginning of term 2 in coordination with the Project Research module (CO885). Projects are normally selected from a list of suggestions proposed by the department, a number of which may involve industrial collaboration.  Alternatively, students may propose a project of their own if a suitable member of academic staff is available to act as the supervisor.  In all cases the particular project must be appropriate for, and relevant to, the student's programme of study.The project consists of an extended period during which students work on a specific piece of project work and a report on this work in the form of a dissertation.  Project work is normally undertaken individually.The project examines the student's ability to research the literature, to understand and expand on a specific technical problem commensurate with their programme of study and relate it to other work, to carry out investigations and practical work generally including programming and describe results and draw conclusions from them and to write a coherent and well organised dissertation.

   CO846 - Cloud Computing


   
    From Wikipedia"Cloud computing is Internet-based computing, whereby shared servers provide resources, software, and data to computers and other devices on demand, as with the electricity grid. Cloud computing is a natural evolution of the widespread adoption of virtualization, service-oriented architecture and utility computing. Details are abstracted from consumers, who no longer have need for expertise in, or control over, the technology infrastructure "in the cloud" that supports them.Cloud computing describes a new supplement, consumption, and delivery model for IT services based on the Internet, and it typically involves over-the-Internet provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. It is a byproduct and consequence of the ease-of-access to remote computing sites provided by the Internet. This frequently takes the form of web-based tools or applications that users can access and use through a web browser as if it were a program installed locally on their own computer."The curriculum will include: Overview of web services and their use in grid/cloud computing; Review grid computing technologies and the relations and differences between grid computing and cloud computing; Virtualisation technologies, tools for cloud computing (Xen or KVM); Open source cloud infrastructures and applications, including Hadoop,Eucalyptus etc; Cutting edge commercial cloud infrastructure and applications.

   CO882 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming


   
    Building upon CO881 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, this module covers the design and implementation of high-quality software using OO techniques. Systems are modelled as configurations of objects communicating with one another. Techniques (e.g. inheritance) are introduced which allow objects to play different roles within a system. These two concepts are key to the support for adaptation and reuse that OOP provides. Much emphasis will be placed on gaining a deep understanding of these concepts and applying them in practice by developing programs in Java. The remainder of the module will explore software component frameworks, specifically those that come packaged with Java, placing most emphasis on the frameworks to support the structuring and manipulation of data (data structures and algorithms).

     CO837      - Natural Computation


     
      There is an increasing use of nature-inspired computational techniques in computer science. These include the use of biology as a source of inspiration for solving computational problems, the application of artificial intelligence techniques to various problems, and the use of physical, chemical and biological and systems to construct computers. It is therefore proposed to allow students the opportunity to become exposed to these ideas for use in their late careers.
