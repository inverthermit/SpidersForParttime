Course structure


 The MSc in Agri-Environmental Economics and Policy is studied over one year full-time or two years part-time and is divided into two stages: eight taught modules (seven of which are compulsory) and a dissertation.

The compulsory modules provide a basis for you to acquire the basic skills for the programme, regardless of your first degree background, while the optional module enables you to acquire a broader understanding of the issues in growth and development, trade and development, or further your skills in econometrics. All MSc students take a module in Research Methods, which provides practical skills and knowledge for MSc-level research.

All of our MSc programmes require some mathematical analysis, and we recognise that students have widely differing backgrounds in mathematics. The first week of all our MSc programmes includes compulsory intensive teaching in mathematics, refreshing and improving your skills in order to equip you with the techniques you will need for the rest of the programme.

Students who successfully pass the taught element of the programme, proceed to the dissertation stage, where you undertake a supervised project of your choice on an applied issue in environmental economics. Advice on choice of dissertation topic and management is given during the taught stage of the programme. The dissertation stage develops students&rsquo; research skills and follows on from the Research Methods module. Student dissertations are supervised by academic staff.

   EC831 - Rural and Peasant Economies


   
    This module demonstrates the unique role that agriculture plays in economic development, poverty alleviation and the development of rural non-farm sectors, looking at the relationship between urban and rural economies based on the way in which these economies trade with each other and are influenced by public policy. It discusses the importance of the rural non-farm sector in the reduction of poverty and demonstrates the importance of market and infrastructural development in this process. It then goes on to look at theoretical approaches and empirical models that characterise peasant and rural household behaviour and analyses opportunities and constraints on development of rural economies and commercialisation of peasant households. Finally it assesses different government reform programmes and their impact on rural areas and small scale farming.Topics Rural and peasant economies: importance, definitions and analytical approaches Development and rural development Agriculture, poverty and rural development Development of rural-urban terms of trade Rural non-farm sectors and pro-poor growth Economic objectives of rural inhabitants Rural households: profit maximisation and risk preferences Households as producers and consumersAnalysis of opportunities and constraints facing rural farm households Land, technology and institutions

   EC817 - Research Methods


   
    The aim of this module is to introduce you to a range of research methods and sources available in modern economics, and enable you to gain an understanding of their application in the context of your own MSc dissertation topic. In more practical terms, this module deals with the practicalities of postgraduate level research: acquiring and reviewing basic analytical skills, choosing a dissertation topic, deriving interesting and well-focused research questions, addressing questions with data or theory,  and interpreting and writing up results. It aims to ease the transition of students who merely learn about existing research to being researchers working on their MSc dissertations. The module is taught by various members of the School and as such will expose you to some topics we work on and the methodologies we use. It has two components. The first focuses on specific skills: mathematical skills, use of library resources, writing skills, and data collection and management. The second aims to prepare you for the dissertation stage by giving you some concrete help and feedback in choosing a research topic and planning your work.

   EC821 - Econometric Methods


   
    This module aims to study basic single equation econometric techniques in an intuitive and practical way to develop your understanding and ability to apply econometric methods.You will develop an understanding of the conventional linear regression model and the problems associated with the application of regression methods to economic modelling. The module is concerned with the application of econometric methods, with little emphasis on the mathematical aspects of the subject (which may be studied in other modules). The microcomputer software package STATA is used for practical work throughout this module, both as a means of providing realistic applications of the theory developed in lectures and to give you experience in the use of such software as a preparation for your own empirical research.No previous knowledge of computing or econometrics is required.

   EC803 - Trade and Development


   
    This module is designed for students with interests in both development and international economics. It aims to discuss some of the fundamental models (and their extensions) in international economics and link them to the growth and development process of regions and countries. Throughout this module we provide you with the analytical tools and theoretical knowledge necessary to understand these links. We also focus on both the theoretical foundations and extensions of trade theory and the empirical evidence available to the current theoretical debates. The module consists of two main sections. The first one is devoted to the foundations of trade theory and it is the basic building block around which the rest of the module pivots. The second section deals with the relation between trade liberalisation, exports and long run growth, covering both the theory and empirical evidence.

   EC825 - Applied Microeconometrics


   
    Empirical evaluation of economic models is crucial to the study and application of economics. This module builds upon the material covered in the Econometric Methods module EC821 which introduced you to linear regression models and the problems associated with economic modelling involving single equation econometric techniques. The emphasis is on applied econometrics and so the module aims to develop further your understanding of applied econometrics and to introduce techniques used in applied microeconomic analyses. Hence, the module is concerned with the application and properties of econometric methods, with less emphasis on the mathematical aspects of the subject. Our main focus is on the techniques appropriate for the analysis of cross-section and panel (cross-section/time series) data, which are now used widely in many areas of economics. An understanding of these techniques is essential to anyone attempting to evaluate, and/or undertake, applied microeconomic analysis. Collectively, these latter techniques are referred to as microeconometrics.

   EC815 - Growth and Development Theory


   
    Some of the greatest and most important books written in economics have been about the progress of nations. Some of the most distinguished economists in the world are development economists concerned with the economic progress of developing countries. Why are some countries rich and others poor? Why do some countries grow faster than others, and why have some countries got left behind? This graduate module, Growth and Development Theory,  introduces you to  theories  of growth and development  both old and new  looking at the various influential models that have been propounded over the years from Adam Smith and other classical economists in the 18th and 19th centuries to new endogenous growth theory in the modern era. As well as aggregate models associated with the names of Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Harrod, Solow, and the new growth theorists (Barro, Romer), there are also sectoral models emphasising the role of particular factors of production or sectors of the economy, such as Arthur Lewiss famous model of economic development with unlimited supplies of labour, and Nicholas Kaldors stress on the role of manufacturing industry based on increasing returns. We also look at centre-periphery models of growth and development associated with Gunnar Myrdal and Raul Prebisch, and constraints on growth imposed by the balance of payments and inflation.
