   SE857 - Advanced Topics in Primate Behaviour


   
    The purpose of this module is to provide students with an understanding of primate behaviour and ecology, and how this allows us to better understand the evolutionary biology of human behaviour. Set within an evolutionary framework, this course combines established findings with the latest research. Lectures covers the interaction of primates with their environments, interactions between different species, social and reproductive behaviour within primate groups, the nature and evolution of primate societies, and primate cognition and communication. Seminars will critically examine classic and recent journal articles, considering the quality of research and presentation, and the utility of models derived from primate studies for understanding specific aspects of human behaviour. 


    Credits: 20 credits
     (10 ECTS credits).

   SE858 - Advanced Topics in Human Behaviour


   
    The material presented in this module is drawn from the relatively new academic disciplines of evolutionary anthropology, human behavioural ecology, and evolutionary psychology. The goal of this module is to explore and understand the principles of evolutionary psychology and other complementary paradigms. The module explores human behaviour (primarily human sexual behaviours) from a Darwinian perspective. Topics covered are reproductive and mating strategies, parenting behaviour, kinship, cooperation, survival, jealously, and aggression. The module will provide students with an advanced understanding of the deeply biological nature of human behaviour, and develop skills in critical thinking. Students will be encouraged to bring relevant questions and observations to seminars, and time will be allocated to deal with them.Seminars will critically examine classic and recent journal articles, considering the quality of research and presentation, and the utility and diversity of using Darwinian approaches to explore and explain human behaviour.

   SP844 - Advanced Topics in Group Processes


   
    This module provides an opportunity to study at an advanced level the literature on group processes and intergroup relations and to familiarize oneself with the current small group perspectives on groups. The module builds upon knowledge of social psychology and in places biological psychology gained at undergraduate level. We also consider how social psychological and evolutionary theories in combination can explain group processes. Topics that will be addressed include group cohesion, intragroup and intergroup conflict, status and leadership, and group size. The module draws primarily on small group research in social and evolutionary psychology, but we shall also consider perspectives from other fields, such as economics and anthropology. This module involves a great deal of student presentation, participation and discussion.This module provides an opportunity to study the literature on group processes and intergroup relations at an advanced level and to familiarize yourself with the current small group perspectives on groups.

   SE855 - Research Project (Evolution & Human Behaviour)


   
    This module does not employ formal workshops/ lectures, although students do receive an orientation seminar about (a) how to choose a supervisor, and (b) how to choose a good research topic.

   SE856 - Advanced Topics in Evolutionary Anthropology


   
    This module is an advanced treatment of current topics and debates in evolutionary anthropology such as human behavioural ecology, anthropological genetics, evolutionary demography, growth and development, and human adaptability. Emphasis is on advances in these areas during the past decade and the directions of future research. The goal of this course is to understand these topics and, specifically, how research and publication works in evolutionary and anthropological science. This module will allow students to be exposed to a broad series of topics, opinions, methodologies, journal articles, and ideas in numerous highly relevant fields of research.

   SP813 - Advanced Topics in Intergroup Relations


   
    This module examines advanced theory and research in intergroup relations. We consider the nature of social categorisation processes and how stereotypes develop, persist and change. The module then examines the relationship between intergroup perceptions and prejudice, and how intergroup relationships influence both variables. The module examines how and why stereotypes and prejudice become manifested as discrimination and intergroup conflict, and then how groups become mobilised to perform collective action. We study the motivational and social elements in intergroup relationships, social identity as a group member, and how these issues can be studied both in the laboratory and in real world settings.This module examines advanced theory and research in intergroup relations.

   SP827 - Current Issues in Cognitive Psychology and Neuropsychology


   
    The aim of this core module is to provide a coherent base for understanding the methodological and option modules, each of the latter outlining a major area of concern in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology (vision, learning, memory, language, reasoning, emotion). The relationship between brain and mind, the modularity of brain and mind, and the notion of different levels/frameworks of description and explanation will be discussed. Finally, the principled use of cross-domain constraint satisfaction as an essential heuristic will be critically analysed.Completion of this module should enable students to critically appraise the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of the various disciplines that comprise cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, and to evaluate how these disciplines may successfully be combined to further scientific understanding of the core problems in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology today.The aim of this core module is to provide a coherent base for understanding the methodological and option modules, each of the latter outlining a major area of concern in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology (vision, learning, memory, language, reasoning, emotion).

   SP829 - Advanced Topics in Cognition in Action


   
    The central theme of this module will be to explore how cognition functions in the real world, that is, to investigate the application of cognitive models to the broader context of human behaviour. Possible topics for study include: the role of cognition in development, emotion, memory and action; applications to eyewitness testimony, intentional forgetting and embodied cognition. Practical applications and relevance to a general understanding of behaviour will be emphasised throughout.

   SP842 - Advanced Developmental Social Psychology


   
    Advanced Developmental Social Psychology aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the theoretical accounts of major issues within the field of developmental social psychology (e.g. prejudice and stereotype development). Students will critically review recent research into the development of social cognition, with a focus on the theoretical integration of concepts from developmental psychology and social psychology, and the applied implication of the research under review. These Masters students should gain an in-depth understanding of children's social development and how this knowledge can inform educational practice.

     SP846      - Cognitive Neural Networks


     
      This module aims to give students a thorough introduction in the use and theory of cognitive neural networks. It has a theoretical component, taught in weekly 1-hour lectures. Next to that, students will have to acquire hands-on knowledge of network models in the practicals (surgeries). For psychology students, the course ends with a workshop seminar, in which each student will present on the application of neural nets to higher cognitive phenomena.This course is a collaboration between the Schools of Computing and Psychology, under the umbrella of the Kent Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems (CNCS).
