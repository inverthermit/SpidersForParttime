   SP855 - Research Apprenticeship Dissertation


   
    All students undertake a supervised empirical research project in an area of organisational psychology to gain practical experience of research. The module allows students to develop research skills by working closely with expert researchers or practitioners. The research will be conducted as a research apprenticeship, so the student will work on a wider programme or research developed by the supervisor, or on a project specific to an organisation (still with close supervision from an academic supervisor). Some of the apprenticeship will involve working in collaborative teams (e.g. for data collection) but all students will write up the research independently in the form of a dissertation. Most projects will be with academics from the University (School of Psychology, Kent Business School, or related disciplines) but there will be some opportunities for students to work on projects outside the University with external research partners.
