      DI305 - Biodiversity

      
      
       This module will introduce a range of fundamental concepts that underpin our understanding of biodiversity and, therefore, the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The differences and similarities between the multiple definitions for the term biodiversity will be considered, in addition to examining how scientists are trying to assess the magnitude of biodiversity on the planet. Spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity will be investigated, along with the importance of biodiversity (both use and non-values). The module will then explore the contemporary threats to biodiversity and provision of associated ecosystem services, in conjunction with a broad overview of the methods conservationists employ to protect and maintain biodiversity. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI311 - The Green Planet

      
      
       The module will begin with the question of what defines a plant and how they are related to the other kingdoms. This will then lead on to a journey from the plant cell to vegetation communities and how they interact with, and are important to other groups of organisms. The module will then finish with a discussion surrounding the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (from the Convention on Biological Diversity) and the targets within this document.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO602 - Social Research Methods

      
      
       In this module you will begin to understand the process and debates surrounding how researchers learn more about the social world. What techniques and approaches do social researchers draw upon to organise, structure and interpret research evidence? How do we judge the quality of research? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the range of frameworks and methodologies? The first part of the module introduces you to the conceptual issues and debates around the best way to explore social questions, forms and issues, and an overview of some popular methods for doing so. In the Spring Term, you will spend most of your time applying what you have learned in a group research project and an individual research design project. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DI528 - Conservation Social Science: Methods and Research Design

      
      
       This module introduces students to social science methods and research design - an increasingly important area of expertise in conservation, both in academia and in professional practice.  Students will gain basic training and practical experience in the design and use of (a) qualitative interviews and (b) questionnaires.  Sessions will also be devoted to processing and analysis of qualitative data, and also basic descriptive statistics to analyse quantitative data, but not inferential statistics, since this is covered elsewhere in the BSc programme (DI508).  Towards the end of the module we will look in more depth at the principles of research design in order to help students begin to plan their final year research projects.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      SO525 - Environmental Politics

      
      
       Environmental issues have become central matters of public concern and political contention. In this module we shall consider explanations for the rise  and social distribution of environmental concern as well as the forms of organisation that have been adopted to address environmental questions, including the emergence of global environmental issues and the responses to them. The development of environmental protest, environmental movements and Green parties are central concerns, but we shall also consider the greening of established political parties and political agenda.  Is it realistic to expect the development of a global environmental movement adequate to the task of tackling global environmental problems. The approach is broadly comparative and examples will be taken from Europe (east and west), North America, Australasia and south-east Asia.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO539 - Environmental Policy and Practice

      
      
       This module aims to give you an understanding of the ways in which governments have attempted to address environmental issues such as climate change, conservation, and pollution control. It discusses the role of government and other interest groups in formulating and implementing environmental policy, the various forms of policy mechanism that are employed, and the constraints upon their effective implementation.

      DI522 - Research Project

      
      
       The module is considered as an important element of Wildlife Conservation undergraduate training.  The opportunity to engage in personal research is seen as an essential element of academic training in all disciplines.  The particular skills necessary to undertake research, whether practical fieldwork or laboratory work or a desk-based study, can only be taught through the medium of practically orientated investigative tasks.  The principle objective in the research project is to assist students in gaining insight into the organisation, analysis and communication of research.  The approved investigation may be novel i.e. one that has not previously been carried out, or it may repeat previously executed work for comparative or control purposes.   

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DI527 - Practical Guiding and Interpretation

      
      
       The purpose of this module is to provide students with both a theoretical and working knowledge and understanding of guiding and interpretation (where interpretation is seen as educational activity that aims to reveal meaning and relationships through the use of first hand experience and illustrative media, rather than simply communicating factual information). In offering a rigorous, academic understanding of the subject area, as well as engaging with basic background facts and issues the lectures will cover the theoretical context of each subtopic, whether this is for example, the historical development of guiding, the process of storytelling, or the nature of factual information. Seminars will address the theoretical and evidential background covered in the lectures, address questions and issues that arise, critically examine relevant literature, and consider the practical implications in relation to guiding and interpretation. They will also assess examples of guiding from other sites, discuss and inform students private study activities, and include visits to potential guiding sites on campus. Lectures and seminars will be complemented by student presentation exercises and practical guiding and critique sessions. The final assessment will be of a short guided tour of campus focussed on a specific subject/theme, plus a written descriptive and analytical report that sets this tour within the wider theoretical and research framework. Successful completion of the module will enhance prospects of employment and business set-up in conservation and related heritage tourism industriesTopics covered   What guiding and interpretation are + their history, development and importance The visitor experience  expectations, the visit event and outcomes Preliminary site surveys and information gathering  Improving presentation and interpretative skills Developing fact lists and interpretative materials  The nature of narrative and the narrative of nature  Guiding and interpretation in practice I Planning, risk assessment and customer care Guiding and interpretation in practice II

      SO657 - Digital Culture

      
      
       This module will examine the impact of digital technology on our social and cultural lives. It will concentrate on how the Internet in particular has challenged some of our more traditional notions of identity and self, the body, relationships, community, privacy, politics, friendship, war and crime, economics, among others. Lectures will show how some of the basic components of culture such as notions of identity, space, the body, community, and even the very notion of what it is to be human, have been complicated by the rise of virtuality and cyberspace. We will also examine these issues through case study phenomena unique to digital culture, currently including gaming, music, cybersex and social networking.

      EC540 - Development Economics

      
      
       There is a wide range of views and approaches to the study of economic development spanning the whole of the political spectrum from the Marxist left to the libertarian right, and also a rich historical literature. To understand the module, some prior knowledge of economic theory and statistics is required, and a willingness to read widely. But the aim of the module is to teach the basic principles of economic development in order to answer such questions as:Why are there divisions in the world economy between rich and poor countries? How did these divisions arise and what forces perpetuate them? How important are such factors as agriculture, industry, investment performance, population growth, domestic finance, international finance and trade in explaining the economic performance of nations? What role does economics in general have to play in an understanding of why some countries are poor and others rich?

      SE594 - Anthropology and Development

      
      
       Primarily intended to offer a critical analysis of the concept of development, particularly as it is used to talk about economic and social change in the developing world, the module shows how anthropological knowledge and understanding can illuminate 'development issues' such as rural poverty, environmental degradation, international aid and humanitarian assistance, climate change and the globalization of trade.  Topics discussed include the role of anthropology in development practice, by examining some of the methods being used to either study or participate in current development projects, whether at local, national or international levels of intervention.

      SA519 - The Social Politics of Food

      
      
       The module provides an introduction to social and political issues raised by food and its provision, exploring how sociologists, social anthropologists and policy analysts have addressed this area. The module examines the role of food within the household and beyond, exploring the ways in which food and food practices make manifest social categorisations such as gender, age, ethnicity and religion. Using the examples of vegetarianism and religion, it examines the way food is entwined with symbolic and moral categorisations. The module as also addresses the political and policy issues raised by food, exploring government involvement in the area of ingestion, drawing parallels between food, alcohol and tobacco. In doing so it addresses the political issues raised by the large corporate interests of the food industry, and the role of the market in shaping provision. It addresses questions of public health, dietary adequacy and the future of the welfare state through sessions on schools meals and food banks.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW586 - Environmental Law II

      
      
       Environmental Law II builds upon the themes introduced in Environmental Law I whilst placing central emphasis upon the environmental and ecological implications of land use and development, and the regulation of land use activities to secure protection of biodiversity. The module commences with some cross-cutting issues, encompassing civil liability for environmental harms and human rights in respect of the environment, before turning to consideration of regimes for restricting land use to prevent unacceptable kinds of environmental and ecological harm. This involves looking at land use development controls in national law and European Community requirements for environmental assessment of projects and plans to anticipate and mitigate the environmental impacts of development. This leads into a discussion of laws that are more specifically concerned with the protection of species and habitats, either through direct restrictions upon destructive activities or through legal mechanisms to secure biodiversity conservation through designation and management of land that is of ecological importance. In respect of each topic, the object is to place discussion of national and European Community laws into context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving environmentally and ecologically appropriate land use and conservation of biodiversity, and ultimately sustainable development.

      DI501 - Climate Change and Conservation

      
      
       This module will inform students how climate has influenced the diversity of life on Earth, from past to present. The role that anthropogenic factors have played in contemporary climate change since the commencement of the industrial era will be examined in detail, in addition to considering their possible effect on future climatic scenarios. The impact of climate change on individual organisms, populations and communities will be investigated, with particular emphasis given to understanding how species are responding. Human impacts from and vulnerabilities to global warming will also be considered. The module will explore how conservation biologists are using particular interventions to ameliorate the most harmful and destabilising effects of climate change. From a more general perspective, the social, economic and political ways in which climate change can be mitigated will be assessed.

      DI505 - Conceptual Frameworks in Conservation Science

      
      
       The aim of the module is to cover major overarching and current issues, such as understanding biodiversity in the fossil record, extinction rates and how they are calculated, and how many species are there and why it matters. By looking at these bigger picture issues conceptual thinking will be brought in; for example how using basic biological knowledge, we can estimate the number of species on Earth. In addition, there will be guest lectures, and discussion of current global issues that are making the press such as the results of major international conferences; past examples included the outcomes of the Copenhagen conference on climate change and the concept of 'Planetary Boundaries'.

      DI518 - Contemporary Conservation Science

      
      
       Conservationists must continually analyse relevant and topical issues in a broad, real-world context. This includes understanding contemporary research, critically evaluating its ecological, evolutionary and interdisciplinary basis, and using this information to inform effective solutions to conservation problems that are embedded in social, political and economic reality. In this module, students will use and apply knowledge/skills gained throughout their degree programme during in-depth discussions of how current research programmes, as presented at the weekly DICE seminars, fit into the wider conservation context. In addition, they will write up these evaluations as a series of News and Views style commentary articles, as published in the top international journal Nature.

      DI520 - Conservation and Communities

      
      
       The driving causes of biodiversity loss are not just ecological, but also political, economic and cultural, and conservationists need to acquire the knowledge and skills to address broader social contexts. This module aims to introduce students to cutting-edge debates about the place of local people in biodiversity conservation, and provide them with an overview of the essential role that the social sciences play in the analysis of environmental issues. Objectives of the module are to provide students with a broad conceptual understanding of the social context of conservation, and particularly of the importance of politics and economics; knowledge of the history of conservation approaches towards local communities; familiarity with key issues in the implementation of community conservation; and
