      MA565 - Groups and Rings

      
      
       Groups are sets with a single binary operation.  They arise as symmetry groups in contexts from puzzles like Rubiks cube to chemistry, where they help list molecules with a given number of atoms involved.  In contrast, rings have two binary operations, generalising the arithmetic of integer numbers. This part of algebra has many applications in electronic communication, in particular in coding theory and cryptography.

      MA588 - Mathematical Techniques and Differential Equations

      
      
       Most physically interesting problems are governed by ordinary, or partial differential equations.  It is examples of such equations that provide the motivation for the material covered in this module, and there is a strong emphasis on physical applications throughout. The aim of the module is to provide a firm grounding in mathematical methods: both for solving differential equations and, through the study of special functions and asymptotic analysis, to determine the properties of solutions. The module will provide invaluable to anybody who later takes third year options in asymptotics, numerical analysis or differential equations.The following topics will be covered: Ordinary differential equations: method of Frobenius, general linear second order differential equation. Special functions: Bessel, Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre and Chebyshev functions, orthogonal functions, gamma function, applications of special functions.  Partial differential equations; linear second order partial differential equations; Laplace equation, diffusion equation, wave equation, Schr&ouml;dingers equation; Method of separation of variables.

      MA629 - Probability and Inference

      
      
       This module develops the techniques introduced in the first year probability and statistics modules, and lays the foundation for several third year statistics modules. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations.  The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module.  Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  All of these have been introduced in the first year statistics module.  The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation.  Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, etc.  Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables.  Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution.  Principles of statistical inference.  Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency).  Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments.  Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test.  Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.

      MA632 - Regression Models

      
      
       The aims of the module are to introduce the students to the theory and practice of regression, and associated linear model techniques. Quite often experimenters and researchers wish to express a response variable y as a function of some other (explanatory) variables. For example, y might be the yield of a chemical process and the explanatory variables might be temperature and pressure. Knowing the relationship would enable y to be predicted for particular values of temperature and pressure. In this module the method of deriving such a relationship will be that of least squares and the theoretical and practical aspects of this method will be covered in some detail. There will be opportunity for students to use computer programs.The module covers most of the following topics: definition of the linear model and regression, least squares estimates, sums of squares, expectations, properties of estimators, the ANOVA table, standard errors and confidence intervals for parameters, residuals, diagnostics, regression with two explanatory variables, matrix formulation of the model, multiple regression, extra sum of squares principle, use of MINITAB, model selection strategies, introduction to analysis of variance.

      MA584 - Computational Mathematics

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide an introduction to the methods, tools and ideas of numerical computation. In applications mathematics frequently generates specific instances of standard problems for which there are no easily obtainable analytic solutions. Examples might be the task of determining the value of a particular integral, or of finding the roots of a certain non-linear equation. Methods are presented for solving such problems on a modern computer. Besides a description of the basic numerical procedure, each method is analysed in terms of when it best works, how it compares with alternative approaches, and the way it may be implemented on a computer. Numerical computations are almost invariably contaminated by errors, and an important concern throughout the module is to understand the source, propagation and magnitude of these errors.The syllabus will cover: Introduction to numerics; solutions of equations in one variable; interpolation and polynomial approximation; numerical differentiation; numerical integration; direct methods for solving linear systems; iterative techniques for solving linear systems.

      MA578 - Dissertation for MMath Mathematics

      
      
       The module offers students the opportunity to work independently, under limited supervision, on an area of mathematics of their choice.  There is no specific mathematical syllabus for this module.  The topic of the dissertation will depend on the mutual interests of the student and the students chosen supervisor.  However, there will be four workshops on key skills relevant to dissertation planning and oral presentation.Students will be expected to discuss possible dissertation topics with academic staff members of the Mathematics group within SMSAS.  An initial supervision will be arranged during the first three weeks of the Autumn term during which the student and supervisor will discuss the approaches to the topic and draw up a timetable plan which will include some meetings to discuss progress and areas of difficulty.  Over the next 3-4 weeks most of the work will be background reading and project planning, which will be the basis for the dissertation plan report.  The main work and writing of the dissertation will occur during the second half of the Autumn term and the Spring term.  Students are expected to arrange regular meetings with their supervisor to discuss progress.  The supervisor will normally see a draft copy of the dissertation before the final version is submitted at the end of the Spring term.

      MA587 - Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

      
      
       Most differential equations which arise from physical systems can not be solved explicitly in closed form, and thus numerical solutions are an invaluable way to obtain information about the underlying physical system. The first half of the module is concerned with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several different numerical methods are introduced and error growth is studied. Both initial value and boundary value problems are investigated.  The second half of the module deals with the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The syllabus includes initial value problems for ODEs, Taylor methods, Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, error bounds and stability.  Boundary value problems for ODEs, shooting methods and finite difference schemes.  Partial Differential Equations, difference schemes, iterative methods, stability analysis and the method of lines.

      MA572 - Complex Analysis

      
      
       The module is concerned with complex functions, that is functions which are both defined for and assume complex values.  Their theory follows a quite different development from that of real functions, is remarkable in its directness and elegance, and leads to many useful applications.Topics covered will include: Complex numbers. Domains and simple connectivity.  Integration and  Cauchys theorem.  Singularities and residues.  Applications.

      MA574 - Polynomials in Several Variables

      
      
       This module provides a rigorous foundation for the solution of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  In the 1890s, David Hilbert proved four ground-breaking theorems that prepared the way for Emmy Noether's famous foundational work in the 1920s on ring theory and ideals in abstract algebra.  This module will echo that historical progress, developing Hilbert's theorems and the essential canon of ring theory in the context of polynomial rings.  It will take a modern perspective on the subject, using the Groebner bases developed in the 1960s together with ideas of computer algebra pioneered in the 1980s. The syllabus will be: Multivariate polynomials, monomial orders, division algorithm, Groebner basis; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and its meaning and consequences for solving polynomials in several variables; Elimination theory and applications; Linear equations over systems of polynomials, syzygies, discussion of Hilbert's Syzygies Theorem, its proof and applications. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other applications.  Depending on time, these may include: invariants of group actions, linear PDEs, combinatorics and the Stanley-Reisner ring, and algebraic codes.

      MA567 - Topology

      
      
       This module is an introduction to point-set topology, a topic that is relevant to many other areas of mathematics. In it, students will be looking at the concept of topological spaces and related constructions. In an Euclidean space, an "open set" is defined as a (possibly infinite) union of open "epsilon-balls". A topological space generalises the notion of "open set" axiomatically, leading to some interesting and sometimes surprising geometric consequences. For example, we will encounter spaces where every sequence of points converges to every point in the space, see why for topologists a doughnut is the same as a coffee cup, and have a look at famous objects such as the Moebius strip or the Klein bottle.

      MA549 - Discrete Mathematics

      
      
       Recently, with the rapid developments in IT, in particular in electronic communication systems, some quite surprising new applications have been found for Discrete Mathematics (as opposed to the Continuous Mathematics based on the calculus). Thus methods for the encoding of information in order to safeguard against eavesdropping or distortion by noise have involved using some basic results from modular arithmetic, polynomial algebra and the theory of finite fields. The module will provide a self-contained introduction to this general area and will cover most of the following topics:(a)   Modular arithmetic, polynomials and finite fields: Applications to orthogonal Latin squares, RSA public key ciphers, coin-tossing over a telephone, linear feedback shift registers and m-sequences.(b)   Error correcting codes: Binary block, linear and cyclic codes including repetition, parity-check, Hamming, simplex; Reed-Muller - BCH - Golay - and other codes; channel capacity; Maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, syndrome and algebraic decoding.

       This module provides an introduction to the study of properties of solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, difference equations and their application to problems in Biology. Topics covered include continuous population models, discrete population models (including the onset of chaos), interacting population models (including predator-prey, competition and mutualism models), reaction kinetics and reaction-diffusion models. The emphasis will be on developing an understanding of nonlinear systems and using practical analytical techniques to analyse them. The module will utilise biological models to illustrate the theory and give an insight into how Mathematics can be of practical use in the study of phenomena which are observed in the real world and include some recent developments in this field. The development will bring together several aspects of Mathematics - analytic, geometric and numerical ideas, as well as computation through the use of MAPLE.The module will cover topics in the following areas: Introduction to nonlinear systems and Mathematical Biology; Continuous population models for single species; Discrete population models; Phase plane analysis; Continuous models for Interacting Populations; Stability, instability and limit cycles; Reaction kinetics; Reaction-diffusion models; Reaction-diffusion (Turing) mechanisms.

      MA871 - Asymptotics and Perturbation Methods

      
      
       The lectures will introduce students to asymptotic and perturbation methods for the approximate evaluation of integrals and to obtaining approximations for solutions of ordinary differential equations. These methods are widely used in the study of physically significant differential equations which arise in Applied Mathematics, Physics and Engineering. The material is chosen so as to demonstrate a range of mathematical techniques available and to illustrate some different applications which are amenable to such analysis.  Asymptotics. Ordering symbols. Asymptotic sequences, expansions and series. Differentiation and integration of asymptotic expansions. Dominant balance. Solution of algebraic and transcendental equations. Asymptotic evaluation of integrals. Integration by parts. Laplace's method and Watson's lemma. Method of stationary phase.  Approximate solution of linear differential equations. Classification of singular points. Local behaviour at irregular singular points. Asymptotic expansions in the complex plane. Stokes phenomena: Stokes and anti-Stokes lines, dominance and sub-dominance. Connections between sectors of validity. Airy functions.  Matched asymptotic expansions. Regular and singular perturbation problems. Asymptotic matching. Boundary layer theory: inner, outer and intermediate expansions and limits. Uniform approximation. WKB method. Schr&ouml;dinger equation and Sturm-Liouville problems. Turning points. Multiple scales analysis and related methods. Secular terms. Multiple scales method. Method of strained coordinates (Lindstedt-Poincar&eacute; method).

      MA962 - Geometric Integration

      
      
       The equations studied in this module will be ordinary differential systems, especially Hamiltonian systems. The aim of this subject area is to obtain and study numerical solutions of these systems that preserve specific qualitative and geometric properties. Review of basic numerical methods, variational methods and Hamiltonian mechanics. Properties that numerical methods can preserve: first integrals, symmetries (for example, scaling, Galilean), symplecticity, time reversibility.  Modified Euler and Runge-Kutta methods, splitting methods. Use and misuse of the various notions of error. Examples, applications and computations.

      MA965 - Symmetries, Groups and Invariants

      
      
       In this module we will study certain configurations with symmetries as they arise in real world applications. Examples include knots described by admissible diagrams or chemical structures described by coloring patterns. Different diagrams and patterns can describe essentially the same structure, so the problems of classification up to equivalence arises. This will be solved by attaching invariants which are then put in normal form to distinguish them. Review of basic methods from linear algebra, group theory and discrete mathematics; Reidemeister moves and the Smith Normal form of integral matrices; The Jones - and Kauffman polynomials, limits of classification; Permutation groups, transitivity, primitivity, Burnside formula and Polya-enumeration; Examples, observations, generalizations and proofs.

      MA973 - Basic Differential Algebra

      
      
       Differential algebra is a relatively recent branch of algebra that exploits the analogies between systems of algebraic equations and nonlinear systems of (mainly ordinary) differential equations. The basic references are (1) and (2) below. The tools developed in differential algebra are useful for practical problem solving, but they must be used through computer algebra packages since computations can get very heavy. In this module, we will give special emphasis to the package  "DifferentialAlgebra" included in the Maple kernel. We will give a rigorous but example led introduction to the main ideas of computer algebra. The main applications to be discussed are the analysis of singularities and the simplification of nonlinear differential systems. As already indicated, the module will have a strong computational flavour: Students will explore concrete examples with the computer algebra system Maple, comparing hand computations with the results achieved by the full-blown algorithms and dispatching large computations to the package.
