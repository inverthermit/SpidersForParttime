      IT552 - Italian Short Story

      
      
       This module focuses on a number of Italian contemporary short stories. More specifically, it discusses the literary treatment of love, and the love story, in the short stories of some of the most important Italian writers of the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century. Works by worldwide renowned authors such as Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese and Leonardo Sciascia, accomplished "postmodernist" writers belonging to a younger generation such as Antonio Tabucchi and Pier Vittorio Tondelli, as well as less celebrated authors such as Gianni Celati, Erri De Luca and Fabrizia Ramondino will be taken into consideration. While not underestimating the profound economic, social and political changes that Italy underwent during the last sixty years, particular emphasis will be given to the similar way in which all these writers seem to fictionally conceive of the love relationship as a missed encounter. In spite of the manifold forms of love being described in these texts (between husband and wife; wife and lover; young boy and ideal father; sister and brother; mother and daughter; two young men, etc.), all the short stories chronologically analysed in this module seem to rely on Calvino's provoking suggestion according to which the missed encounter is the "fundamental element" of love relationships.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      IT548 - Italian Cinema and Literature

      
      
       This module discusses contemporary film adaptations (1990s-2000s) taken from four different Italian textual sources (childrens tale, monologue, novel and non-fiction) under the following main aspects: 1.   as "parallel" works which supplement the original literary texts. Films expand, update and adjust the themes of the original literary texts to the historical, social and cultural context in which the adaptations are made. 2.   as works of literary criticism. The way the narrative of a film adaptation is structured and the way a film chooses to selectively focus on some particular episodes and themes is evidence of how the film director critically analyses the literary text and "re-writes" it in the form of a screenplay and in the editing of the material filmed;3.   as an altogether "new" product that structurally differs from the original literary source. Cinema's language relies on signifying images or visual signs that are irreducible to those of written and spoken languages;4.   finally, we will analyse the impact that filmmaking had on the art of writing, assessing the extent to which contemporary novels are often already written with the big screen in mind. We will focus on four emblematic contemporary adaptations: Collodis Pinocchio, adapted by Roberto Benigni, Bariccos Novecento (a monologue), adapted by Tornatore (La leggenda del pianist sulloceano), Ammanitis Io non ho paura, adapted by Gabriele Salvatores, and finally Savianos Gomorra, adapted by Matteo Garrone.

      IT564 - Istantanea: Photography and Visual Culture in Modern and Contemporary I

      
      
       This module aims at developing students visual literacy within the context of Italian studies, by teaching the skills necessary for the reading of static visual materials, especially photography. Contextually, it aims at developing and enhancing the critical response of students to such imagery, with particular focus on their social, cultural and political context. Photography worldwide has been at the centre of daily life, artistic production and political propaganda for the last century and a half. This holds all the more true for Italy, whose contemporary history as a unified country begins almost at the same time as the popularisation of photography. This module will explore this relationship on a socio-historical basis: It will analyse, among other topics, the portrayal of the Risorgimento; Lombrosos criminological and anthropometric use of photography; pseudo-anthropological photography in colonialist exploits, racism and eugenics; Fascist propaganda; futurism and modernism; neo-realist documentary photography and its influence on photojournalism of the 1960s-70s; the paparazzi, fashion and advertisement; photography and the contemporary visual arts; digital photography and social networks. By means of a close reading of photographic and other visual materials, the students will gain a profound understanding of the practicesideological, political, commercial, aesthetic, socialthat produce such materials within the modern Italian cultural context.

      LS550 - Reading Monstrosity in Iberian Culture

      
      
       This module will take a close look at the figure of the monster in Iberian culture, ranging from medieval considerations of the monster in bestiaries to eighteenth-century medical treatises on monstrous forms to twentieth-century depictions of monsters. We will focus on the historical context out of which a particular meaning of the monster emerges. In order to do so, the course will draw upon high and popular culture, a variety of disciplines, and a variety of media (literature, prints, paintings, films). Discussions will be supplemented with relevant historical, critical or theoretical readings. The monster in this course will be an interpretative model for an understanding of how notions such as normalcy, beauty, the classical body are constructed and will enable us to look at issues of otherness, gender, and race. This module is taught in English

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
