Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules.

 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PO314 - Introduction to Political Thought

      
      
       This module introduces students to the study of political concepts that are central to thinking about political life.  Through the study of these concepts students will be introduced to the principal ideas of many of the major figures in the history of Western political thought (for example, Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau and Marx) and to the work of many contemporary political theorists as well (John Rawls, Michael Sandel, Richard Rorty, Susan Okin and others).  In addition, lectures and tutorials will familiarise students with a variety of different debates about how best to understand any given concept (such as, debates about what constitutes 'human nature') as well as how to understand the relationship between different concepts (such as, whether a just society must be an equal one or not).  Moreover, the module is designed to allow students to develop a set of conceptual tools with which to interrogate and shape the political world in which they find themselves; a world which is saturated everyday with competing articulations of the political concepts that we will study in this module.  As such, students should come to develop a subtle appreciation of how the concepts examined on this module are, to greater or lesser degrees, intrinsic to all of their studies in politics and international relations (and related subjects).

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO327 - Introduction to Comparative Politics

      
      
       The module introduces students to the empirical study of the key structures, institutions and processes in political life. It does so through the lens of the comparative method, in which political systems are compared and contrasted to test hypotheses about the factors producing similarities and differences across countries and over time. The module first introduces the comparative method, and then discusses the different ways in which political systems can be organized and classified. It focuses on the three key powers in all political systems  executive, legislative and judicial  the intermediate actors that link people to their governments, namely political parties, interest groups and the media, and how citizens behave politically in relations to such institutions and actors. Throughout the module, students are encouraged to identify the factors and the processes leading to different political outcomes across states and over time and to use both qualitative and quantitative data to support their arguments.

      FR599 - Description of Modern French

      
      
       Written and spoken French are now, arguably, so far apart as to constitute distinct varieties. Unlike most French modules, this module will take the latter as its starting point. The phonology (sound system) will first be explored, and basic transcription skills acquired, with consideration of recent and ongoing changes in the general system known as fran&ccedil;ais standard. The module will then move on to consider the gap between written and spoken French grammar, notably in such areas as the tense/mood system, morphosyntax or pronouns, grammatical gender and agreement, and verb classification. The treatment of neologisms, and particularly the status of franglais in contemporary French, will also be considered. Although the module will provide students with some basic tools of linguistic description, no background in Linguistics is required or assumed.

      FR593 - Paris: Myth and Reality in the 19th century

      
      
       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and interesting history.  In the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the nineteenth century (1830, 1848, 1870-71), the city played a key role in deciding the fate of the nation.  In the same period, it grew dramatically in size and emerged as a modern metropolis.  Widely divergent views were expressed as to the wholesomeness of city living; opinion differed equally violently among writers as to the benefits to be derived from the explosive growth of the city. The module will examine conditions of life in the real Paris of the 19th Century and in particular the radical and highly controversial changes to the face of the city brought about during the Second Empire under the direction of Baron Haussmann.  The main focus of the module, however, will be the images of the city as mediated in contemporary fiction (Balzac and Zola amongst others), poetry (Baudelaire) and painting (Manets vision of city life).

      FR594 - Paris: Myth and Reality in the 20th century

      
      
       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and exciting history. It played, for example, a key role during the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the 19th century. This module follows on from FR593  Paris: Myth and Reality I (which is NOT a prerequisite for FR594). It explores the different and evolving representations of Paris of the 20th century in the context of modernity and postmodernity. Although the main focus of the course will be literary, including poetry and fiction, there will also be examination of the changing landscape of the capital as mediated through film.

      FR598 - Occupation and Resistance in the French Novel

      
      
       This module will examine ways in which this turbulent and divisive period of French history is reflected in imaginative writing. Some texts are nearly contemporaneous with events; others reflect collective memory of the Occupation across generations. Questions raised will include: problems of realistic description and of narrative technique; the relationship of the individual to events beyond his/her control; conflicting loyalties and responsibilities; Resistance and occupation as metaphor; the mode r&eacute;tro in French fiction since the 1960s. A certain amount of historical background reading will be essential.

It will include plays in French by major authors such as Apollinaire, Cocteau, Sartre and Ionesco. Taking one play each week, the syllabus will be approached in broadly chronological order, with emphasis given to diversity but also to continuing links and developments, such as the use and influence of popular culture, politics and classical mythology.

       This module will introduce a selection of short narrative fiction in French drawn from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It will reflect on the techniques and forms used by a number of authors and inquire whether short fictions tend to display common features.  The authors chosen use the form in a wide variety of ways, from illustrating a philosophical position to dramatising an ethical dilemma or even questioning the conventions of fiction themselves.  The texts will be considered with some reference to concepts drawn from general theory of narrative.

       Detective fiction is an extremely popular genre whose basic template can give rise to a multitude of approaches, settings, plots and values. This course is designed to give students an overview of the tradition of French crime fiction as it has evolved from the mid-19th century to the early 21st century. Short crime fiction, full crime novels, and film will be analysed. Close attention will be paid to generic conventions, and how they alter over time. Questions of social order and disorder will be central to our enquiry. We will also study the extent to which detective novels mount a critique of contemporary society.

       This module examines the complex relationship between foreign policy analysis and foreign policy practice.  It does so by exploring shifting approaches to making and examing foreign policy, including the contributions of  IR theory to Foreign Policy Analysis. Historical antecedents of foreign policy as a practice are examined via observations of traditional bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, followed by traditional state-based actors, non-state actors, and the nature of the structure they inhabit. FP decision-making is then examined, followed by the process of foreign policy implementation. The issue of motivation is tackled through analyses of the largely domestic impact of culture, interests and identity and broader effect of intra-state norms, ethics, the issue of human rights. Case studies of key countries reinforce the practical implications of above-mentioned issues throughout the module.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO566 - Europe and the World

      
      
       This module focuses on European foreign policy, i.e. the external dimension of European politics, exploring the relationship between Europe and the rest of the world. Following the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU now stands poised to unleash significant foreign policy potential in its neighbourhood, and beyond. The difference between the EU and Europe will be examined in component fashion through the foreign policies of some of the major European states. Thereafter, the foreign policy tools of the EU will be looked at, after moving into an in-depth thematic treatment of the key foreign policy issues facing the EU vis-&agrave;-vis its security, defence, economic, trade and development relations, and its dynamics with rising powers, the US, its eastern and southern neighbours in Central Europe, Asia and North Africa. Other issues include its burgeoning military capacity and a growing set of overseas military missions. Broader themes will include the impact of global developments on Europe, the international significance of European integration and the more general role of Europe in the new world order This course will draw on theories from political science and international relations and concepts defining Europes global role.

      PO646 - Presidents, Parliaments and Democracy

      
      
       This module introduces students to central debates about the influence of different executive formats on democratic government. The course examines the differences between and within presidential, parliamentary and semi-presidential constitutions and examines their consequences for the quality of democracy and for policy outcomes. The course initially focuses on identifying the key institutions and processes that shape the behaviour and strategies of politicians in the executive, before moving on to consider the consequences of these for governance, policy-making and democratic stability. Throughout the central focus is on understanding the extent and the ways that formal political institutions may shape how politicians respond to citizen preferences, bargain with each other to resolve political conflict and choose policies. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about the impact of political institutions on politics, different ways of conceptualizing and measuring democratic performance and encouraged to think about how a broad range of other factors may interact with constitutional formats to shape outcomes. The approach used will be broadly comparative and will use case-specific and cross-national evidence from both developed and less developed democracies in all regions of the world.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      FR561 - Contemporary French Cinema

      
      
       This module examines some of the key works of French cinema since 1990. The films in this module will be studied in terms of their cultural background and within the context of French cinema history. While all the films are studied in close detail, students will be invited to develop important themes such as race and national identity, changing perceptions of Paris and the banlieue, and symptoms of social crisis. The aim of the module is to show how French filmmakers have had to invent new forms and styles of film in order to be able to address the specific issues raised by life in contemporary France.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SCL501 - Languages in the Classroom

      
      
       The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act to some extent in the role of a teaching assistant, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a language topic or talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly online journal. Some travel may be required by students taking this module.  In this instance, it should be noted that the University is unable to cover the cost of any such journey.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      FR621 - Writing on Art: Text and Image in Modern French Culture

      
      
       The eighteenth-century 'philosophe' Denis Diderot was the first major French author to write at length about painting, and he bequeathed to later writers such as Baudelaire a new literary genre, the 'salon'. The mutual influence of literature and the visual arts is a major theme of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French culture, and an important area of current research. The module will begin with a study of a selection of passages from Diderot's 'Salon de1767'. We will then examine Balzac's 'Le Chef d'oeuvre inconnu' and 'Sarrasine', Baudelaire's 'Le Peintre de la vie moderne', Zola's 'L'Oeuvre', a selection from Proust's 'A la recherche du temps perdu', and Georges Perecs 'Un Cabinet damateur.

      FR601 - Mothers and Daughters in Women's Writing

      
      
       The module is designed to acquaint students with samples of the main trends within the work of Twentieth Century Women writers by paying close attention to the relations between mothers and their daughters who become writers. Each novel chosen is one of personal analysis of the often-violent relationship between the mothers and their daughters who turn to writing in a search for identity and liberation from the mother or maternal figure of their youth. Students analyse the texts in order to evaluate how the picture of the mother has evolved. We will pay close attention to the underlying theme of the progression of the role of women in French society. Each text will also provide us with a variety of specific themes to discuss which will enable us to better understand the changes which French women have faced during this century.

      FR613 - The Reader and the Text

      
      
       This module aims to examine literature from an unusual angle by concentrating on the importance of the figure of the reader for the interpretation of novels.  Often novels address the reader directly; some novels are written in the second person, as if the reader were a central character.  Sometimes novels involve self-reflexive or self-referential elements that force the reader to reflect on his/her own expectations of literature.  When novels invoke the reader in these various ways, they invite us to reflect on the text  how it comes to exist, who it is for, what is its message or purpose  in new and challenging ways.  The module also concentrates on the 'nouveau roman', which involves sustained reflection on these and related questions.

      FR637 - Travels to Japan in Modern French Culture

      
      
       This course examines the portrayal of Japan in French and Belgian writing and culture from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Since Japan was opened to the West in the mid-19th century, there has been a tradition of French literary japanophilia. The course will permit a critical evaluation of the evolution of French japonisme, from its exoticist beginnings in the work of Pierre Loti, through the travel writing of early- and mid- 20th century authors, to  the portrayal of contemporary Japan in Am&eacute;lie Nothombs and Jacques Roubauds work. Japoniste images by French Impressionist painters will also be studied, as will a cinematic adaptation of Nothombs work. The study of these texts and images will involve the exploration of themes such as: intercultural understanding (or the lack thereof); the idealisation or demonisation of the other; the way in which French writers turn to the foreign culture in order to critique their own culture; the nature of Orientalism; genre (what is travel writing? what are its limits?).

      FR645 - Desire in the Text: Romanticism to Decadence

      
      
       This module presents a broadly chronological survey of canonical works of French literature of the nineteenth century centred on the theme of desire. More specifically, these works explore contemporary codes of love and marriage, shifting gender identities, capitalism, consumerism, moral, social and sexual transgression, alienation, lethargy, and death. The module takes fiction of the Romantic era as its starting point, exploring the frustration of desire associated with the mal du si&egrave;cle (the disillusionment and melancholy experienced by (primarily) young adults in the early nineteenth century). It concludes with naturalist and decadent works of the fin de si&egrave;cle, which are concerned with a discrepancy between desire and a generalised depletion of the energy required to fulfil it. The module identifies desire (whether satisfied, unfulfilled or conspicuously absent) as a central preoccupation in French cultural production of the nineteenth century. It also examines the extent to which desire is a strategy for expressing contemporary concerns and anxieties around specific aspects of modern life with which the human subject was coming rapidly and problematically to terms.

      FR646 - Crossing Borders: Travel in Modern French Writing

      
      
       This module will explore the evolution of the notion of travel in modern French thought and literature by looking at a wide range of French travel writing in prose as well as poetry, essays, and travel diaries from the late 19th century to the late 20th century.The objective is to show how travel writing questions the relevance of myths about travel itself (often seen as a means to discover new worlds and to allow different cultures to blend together) or about the other and otherworldliness.The module takes Arthur de Gobineaus and Victor Hugo's fictional travels to the East as a starting point to explore how 19th-century orientalism fed an imaginary, idealised or demonised conception of the other. From there we will move on to different (post)modern texts by Victor Segalen, Henri Michaux and Nicolas Bouvier, demonstrating how travel and writing can work together to cross borders of a cultural but also linguistic and stylistic nature.More specifically, these different works explore themes such as exoticism, (post)modern conceptions of intercultural relationships, opacity, loneliness, fragmentation, and chaotic trajectories.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
