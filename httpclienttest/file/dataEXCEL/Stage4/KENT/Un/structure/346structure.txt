The plays will be from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries.  Attention will be paid to theories of drama (in particular, Classical and Romantic theory). We will examine issues such as the creation of dramatic illusion, the ways in which character is portrayed on the stage, the meaning of a play in its social and political context, and the ways in which the production of a play can change its impact.  The main focus of the course, however, will be thematic; the various ways in which love, marriage and politics are lent dramatic form by the authors studied.  The works studied will be the following: Moli&egrave;re, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman; Racine, Phaedra; Marivaux, The Double Inconstancy; Hugo, The Preface to Cromwell; Musset, Lorenzaccio; Anouilh, Antigone; Sartre, No Exit.

      FR301 - Writer and Genre in France I

      
      
       This module selects works from the rich tradition of French drama, from the classical to the modern, examining issues such as the creation of dramatic illusion, the ways in which character is portrayed on the stage, the meaning of a play in its social and political context, and the ways in which the production of a play can change its impact. The module is a particularly good means of introduction to French literature, since plays are generally shorter than novels, whilst being equally important in the evolution of French cultural life. All texts are studied in French.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

       This module is designed to introduce students to the range and variety of French literature by the close study of a number of texts from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The authors studied use short fiction to explore a wide variety of themes: philosophical, political, and social questions will be examined as they are raised in each text. Students will undertake close readings of the primary texts and will make connections with broader political, social and cultural issues. All texts are studied in French and the teaching takes place partly in French and partly in English. FR302 may be taken independently of FR301.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      FR308 - Questions of French Cinema

      
      
       This module will provide students with a basic knowledge of the most important periods of French cinema (including realism, the nouvelle vague, Beur cinema, the 1980s 'cin&eacute;ma du look') and introduce key film concepts such as the politique des auteurs. Students will gain experience in critical reading and viewing, in close analysis of films, texts and issues, and in developing arguments in French. They will also be introduced to the skills of presentation and the sustaining of cogent argument in written English. The module will examine a number of films from the 1920s to the 1990s which illustrate the scope and development of French cinema.  While most of the films are now regarded as canonical, a major aim of the module is to place the works in context so as to emphasize their radical and often transgressive power.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      FR310 - Twentieth Century France in Crisis

      
      
       The module explores how four major 'crises' in twentieth-century France are reflected in cinema: World War I, World War II, the Algerian crisis, and the events of May 1968.  A dossier of textual materials provides the student with background historical and cultural documents, and suggests further reading.  Some films are almost contemporary with events, whereas others were made decades later.  We will explore themes such as realistic depiction, socio political agendas, and collective or individual memory.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      TH345 - From: Eden To The End of The World: An Introduction to The Bible

      
      
       The Bible is not a single book, but ta biblia, the library. At the most modest estimate, the literatures of the Bible span a period of over eight hundred years.  If we think of the metaphor of a library, the books in the Bible would not just be shelved in the Religion/Theology section, but also, say, Philosophy, Politics and Cultural History/Myth. The influence of these books on Western culture has been immense. This is a course for those seeking basic biblical literacy, which is profoundly useful for studies in other disciplines (e.g. History, or Literature), as well as for students in Religious Studies. It is a course for those who think they already know the Bible (this course will help you read the Bible in different ways, with new questions) and those who have never read a Bible at all. The course gives a basic overview of the story and contexts of the books of the Bible (Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and New Testament) from Genesis to the Apocalypse of John, or from Eden to the End of the World.This course provides a basic introduction to different sections of the biblical library, combining a general overview with in-depth study of selected passages and books. NB: As with all Biblical Studies courses at the University of Kent, Bible is defined in the broadest sense: the Christian and Jewish canons (73 or 66 books, though we wont be studying all of them!) apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, and also all the ancient and modern intertexts, poems, films and novels, that inform and draw on biblical traditions.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      TH622 - Cracking Biblical Codes: Prophecy, Apocalyptic and Wisdom

      
      
       This module will explore the theme of Biblical Codes from two angles:1) How has the Bible been read as code?2) How can we read/ decode biblical mysteries (prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom) Under heading 1) we will be exploring how different writers and groups (some of them inside the Bible, some of them outside it) have read the Bible as temporal or political code. For example, the biblical book of Daniel attempts to decode the book of Jeremiah, which had already become deeply mysterious to ancient readers. Similarly, the New Testament deciphers biblical prophecy and motifs by applying them to Jesus or the Roman Empire. At the other end of the time spectrum, we find bestsellers like Michael Drosnins The Bible Code (1997), Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHayes attempts to decrypt biblical visions of the end of time by way of contemporary global politics, or recent readings of the book of Ezekiel as prophecies about UFOs. Techniques of decryption are also built into central developments within Jewish and Christian traditions. In fact, what is often called the history of hermeneutics could also be described as the history of How not to read literally. We will be looking at a range of examples of such developments by focusing on readers like Philo of Alexandria, Augustine of Hippo, or Jewish Kabbalah. Under heading 2, we will undertake some in-depth readings of prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom textsthe ones that readers of the Bible find most difficult to decode. Texts to be studied will be taken from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Pseudepigrapha. We will be exploring the contexts that produced these literatures and thinking about how to read (decipher?) them across the abyss of time.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      TH601 - Hindu Religious Thought

      
      
       The main emphasis of the course is on identifying and evaluating the competing soteriological perspectives and paths to spiritual emancipation which have shaped the development of the Hindu religious tradition. Among the themes discussed are: the relationship between mysticism and philosophy, mythology, magic and devotion; gnosis, action and devotion as paths to salvation; ontology and cosmology; cartographies of states of consciousness; theism, panentheism and non-dualism; types of contemplative practice; the role of the body in spiritual life; asceticism and pleasure as vehicles for spiritual liberation; the role of the guru and the nature of spiritual transmission. These themes will be approached through the study of Hindu texts in translation, but attention will also be given to some Sanskrit terminology.

A range of cases will also be explored to provide students with opportunities to think about how relevant concepts might relate to specific social and cultural phenomena, and to provide a basis for the analytical work they undertake in their assessed essay.  An illustrative list of sessions would be:a. ontological and cultural theories of the sacredb. the sacred and cultural sociologyc. The influence of Durkheim's theory of the sacredd. Edward Shils: the place of the sacred in modern societye. Robert Bellah: the case of American civil religionf. Jeffrey Alexander: performing the sacred in the modern worldg.

It will equip you with the ability to situate current views within their historical and theological context, critically assess them, and constructively apply them to current phenomena. The module will introduce you to key Islamic debates such as those which address textual interpretation, the relation between revelation and human reason, and the nature of political authority. It will familiarise you with key sources such as the Qur'an, Hadith and treatises of key Islamic theologians and jurists, and it will introduce you to classical and modern theorists from Ibn Taymiyyah to Tariq Ramadan. A range of case studies will allow you to apply these sources and theories to contemporary situations.

      TH626 - Gods and Government from the Roman Empire to Tony Blair

      
      
       Recent cultural and political theories have been haunted by the question of religion, its definitions and functions, its emancipatory capacities, its relation to violence, and its relationship to the history and future of the concept of the secular. The centrality of religion as a topic for these recent interdisciplinary discussions has emerged in relationship to a growing unease about earlier, modern modes of distinguishing public and private life; a return of religion as an internationally significant political force in recent decades; and surprising appropriations of religion as a figure for secular Western democracy. Theorists (particularly in the area of postcolonial theory) are questioning naturalized or ahistorical distinctions between religion and the secular (e.g., Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Saba Mahmood). Many contemporary thinkers attempt to short-circuit the distinction between religion and politics, making possible surprising paradoxes of a materialist theology (Slavoj iek), an emptied religiosity (Gianni Vattimo), or what Hent de Vries calls simply a political theology. Once we get down beneath the easily-rehearsed stereotypes, we find that the old religious archives (like the Bible) model competing forms of politics: from messianic anarchism to theocracy. In our political historiesand presentsthese have been used (and now are being re-used) in surprising ways.This course considers important moments in the Western history of political theology in order to understand modern and contemporary discussions of secular politics. These moments will be considered in relation to comparable instances of politically imagined theology (or theologically imagined politics) from other religious traditions as well. Students will:- examine key topics in the modern formation of these discussions (e.g., distinctions between public and private; secular spheres; religion as extra-political ideal; fanaticism; politicized evaluations of Western religion as exceptional in relation to the others; religion and political revolution)- map important similarities and differences between Western and non-Western modelling of the relationship between religion and politics- critically evaluate recent presentations of the inherent violence of religions, the inevitability of the clash of civilizations, and the usefulness of religion in making globalization work

      TH636 - Religion and Capitalism

      
      
       The aim of the course is to provide an understanding of the interrelations between religion, modernity, capitalism and ideology.

      TH641 - Death and the Afterlife

      
      
       This module will evaluate and critique a range of historical, philosophical, theological and secular perspectives on death and the afterlife, beginning with the way the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, the Quran, the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Upanishads conceptualize the nature and destiny of humankind, including such concepts as sheol, moksha, purgatory, eternal life, heaven and hell. This will be followed by a discussion of the interplay in western theological and philosophical traditions between competing notions of the resurrection of the flesh and the immortality of the body as well as an evaluation of what various Christian thinkers, including Augustine and Origen, believed that an eternity in heaven or hell might be like. The module will then investigate the range of eschatological teachings that different traditions have offered, including in Christian thought the diversity of realized and future forms of eschatology, as well as the tenability of purported testimony surrounding the possibility of out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences and mind-dependent worlds, and the way in which such endeavours have been sustained or critiqued in the light of scientific and historical advances. The module will conclude with a detailed study of the way in which filmmakers and novelists have approached eschatological and apocalyptic teachings and reconceptualised them, with specific reference to Conrad Ostwalts work on the desacralization of the apocalypse in Jewish and Christian thought in a range of 1990s Hollywood science fiction movies, and the impact that such attempts have had on the way questions of life after death have conventionally been approached.

      TH638 - Global Christianities

      
      
       This module will examine the theme Global Christianities through the lenses of the anthropology of Christianity and the sociology of religion. We will explore the ways in which we can see Christianity as a cultural product, and how Christianity has shaped different cultures and societies globally, as well as how the religion has been shaped by and through encounters in different local settings. We will look at the history of the globalization of Christianity, and consider the historical, political and economic effects of local missionary encounters. The course will examine the processes of conversion to Christianity in different contexts, both at the level of individual and broader social group, and how these have been understood in relation to concepts of modernity. The course will draw attention to the relatively recent emergence of the anthropology of Christianity in relation to the broader disciplines of anthropology as a discrete area of study and how this relates to the study of Christianity as a global phenomenon within sociology. We will consider the ways in which these disciplines have constructed and objectified religion as an object of study in ways that has historically occluded the social scientific study of Christianity in different global contexts. The course will address some of the main debates in the anthropology of Christianity, deepening understanding of global Christianities through exploring studies of Christian cultures in diverse ethnographic contexts. The topics addressed will include: culture and conversion; globalization and localization; interrelations between Christianity, subjectivity and language; embodied and emotional forms of different Christianities; concepts and experiences of God; mediation, immanence and transcendence; coherence and fragmentation; gender, sexuality and the family. Through engaging with readings on these areas, we will explore the socio-religious power-dynamics of Christianity in relation to both culturally dominant and marginal traditions.

       The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and evaluate the range of models by which film and religion may be employed as conversation partners and to provide them with the tools necessary for exploring critical links between theology/religious studies and the medium of film. The course will begin with an examination of the methodological, conceptual and disciplinary issues that arise before exploring in critical depth the historical relationship between religion and film, with specific reference to the reception (ranging from prohibition to utilisation) of film by different religious groups. There will be a focus on particular categories of film and categories and models of religious and theological understanding, allowing students taking this module to develop the critical skills helpful for film interpretation and for exploring possible religious and theological approaches to film criticism.Film clips will be used within lectures and will be discussed and unpacked in the seminars.

      FR593 - Paris: Myth and Reality in the 19th century

      
      
       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and interesting history.  In the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the nineteenth century (1830, 1848, 1870-71), the city played a key role in deciding the fate of the nation.  In the same period, it grew dramatically in size and emerged as a modern metropolis.  Widely divergent views were expressed as to the wholesomeness of city living; opinion differed equally violently among writers as to the benefits to be derived from the explosive growth of the city. The module will examine conditions of life in the real Paris of the 19th Century and in particular the radical and highly controversial changes to the face of the city brought about during the Second Empire under the direction of Baron Haussmann.  The main focus of the module, however, will be the images of the city as mediated in contemporary fiction (Balzac and Zola amongst others), poetry (Baudelaire) and painting (Manets vision of city life).

       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and exciting history. It played, for example, a key role during the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the 19th century. This module follows on from FR593  Paris: Myth and Reality I (which is NOT a prerequisite for FR594). It explores the different and evolving representations of Paris of the 20th century in the context of modernity and postmodernity. Although the main focus of the course will be literary, including poetry and fiction, there will also be examination of the changing landscape of the capital as mediated through film.

       This module will examine ways in which this turbulent and divisive period of French history is reflected in imaginative writing. Some texts are nearly contemporaneous with events; others reflect collective memory of the Occupation across generations. Questions raised will include: problems of realistic description and of narrative technique; the relationship of the individual to events beyond his/her control; conflicting loyalties and responsibilities; Resistance and occupation as metaphor; the mode r&eacute;tro in French fiction since the 1960s. A certain amount of historical background reading will be essential.

       Detective fiction is an extremely popular genre whose basic template can give rise to a multitude of approaches, settings, plots and values. This course is designed to give students an overview of the tradition of French crime fiction as it has evolved from the mid-19th century to the early 21st century. Short crime fiction, full crime novels, and film will be analysed. Close attention will be paid to generic conventions, and how they alter over time. Questions of social order and disorder will be central to our enquiry. We will also study the extent to which detective novels mount a critique of contemporary society. All texts are studied in French and teaching is partly in English, partly in French.

      FR599 - Description of Modern French

      
      
       Written and spoken French are now, arguably, so far apart as to constitute distinct varieties. Unlike most French modules, this module will take the latter as its starting point. The phonology (sound system) will first be explored, and basic transcription skills acquired, with consideration of recent and ongoing changes in the general system known as fran&ccedil;ais standard. The module will then move on to consider the gap between written and spoken French grammar, notably in such areas as the tense/mood system, morphosyntax or pronouns, grammatical gender and agreement, and verb classification. The treatment of neologisms, and particularly the status of franglais in contemporary French, will also be considered. Although the module will provide students with some basic tools of linguistic description, no background in Linguistics is required or assumed.

       It is commonly accepted that identity or a sense of self is constructed by and through narrative  the stories we tell ourselves and each other about our lives. This module explores the complex relationships that exist between memory, nostalgia, writing and identity in a range of twentieth-century autobiographical and first- and third-person fictional works in French. These texts foreground issues of childhood, memory, history, and trauma in the construction of identity.

       This module will introduce a selection of short narrative fiction in French drawn from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It will reflect on the techniques and forms used by a number of authors and inquire whether short fictions tend to display common features.  The authors chosen use the form in a wide variety of ways, from illustrating a philosophical position to dramatising an ethical dilemma or even questioning the conventions of fiction themselves.  The texts will be considered with some reference to concepts drawn from general theory of narrative.

       The main emphasis of the course is on identifying and evaluating the competing soteriological perspectives and paths to spiritual emancipation which have shaped the development of the Hindu religious tradition. Among the themes discussed are: the relationship between mysticism and philosophy, mythology, magic and devotion; gnosis, action and devotion as paths to salvation; ontology and cosmology; cartographies of states of consciousness; theism, panentheism and non-dualism; types of contemplative practice; the role of the body in spiritual life; asceticism and pleasure as vehicles for spiritual liberation; the role of the guru and the nature of spiritual transmission. These themes will be approached through the study of Hindu texts in translation, but attention will also be given to some Sanskrit terminology.

      TH558 - Sociology of Religion

      
      
       The aim of this module is to enable students to think sociologically about religious life. Whilst addressing key debates within the sociology of religion (e.g. secularization, subjectivization), it seeks to introduce students to core concepts and methods in sociology that will enable them to understand religious life in terms of broader social structures and processes.  Examples of issues covered in the module include: the nature of sociology as a discipline, macro and micro levels of analysis, the agency/structure debate and the nature of social structure, individualization, and sociological perspectives on gender, class, emotion, materiality and belief. The significance of intersectionality between different social structures will also be discussed, and useful sources of secondary data (e.g. BRIN) will be explored. The central assessment task for the module  a case study presenting the sociological analysis of the nature and place of religion in a particular individuals life  brings these theoretical and methodological approaches together into a micro-level analysis of lived religion in a way that is informed by broader social and cultural structures. Examples of good writing in this style of sociological research are presented and explored through the module.

      TH515 - Theology and Religious Studies Dissertation

      
      
       Students are required to identify a viable research focus or question for their project which they will then pursue, with supervisory support, in order to submit their final dissertation. In the summer before joining the module, students will be given advice on how to identify their research focus, and by the start of the autumn term in which the module begins they will be expected to have produced a single side of A4 summarising key literature or other sources relevant to their specific project. Individual supervision will begin from the autumn term onwards. Initially this is likely to focus on clarifying the research focus or question, and situating it more deeply in existing literature and debates. Following this a clearer outline plan for conducting the research will be developed, with students then undertaking work necessary to meet each phase of this plan. If the project involves original fieldwork, the student will be expected to submit a research ethics application form for Faculty approval. As the project develops, chapter drafts will be submitted for review and discussion with the supervisor. Supervision contact time is likely to vary according to the project and student need, but will not exceed a total of 6 hours per student (including face to face supervision or time spent writing written feedback to electronically-submitted drafts). Supervisors will provide feedback on chapter drafts, which will need to be submitted to supervisors in good time before supervision meetings, but will not provide feedback on whole draft manuscripts once chapters are completed.Supervisors will only provide supervisory support during term-time. Once the project has been agreed and a supervisor allocated in the autumn term, students will not normally be allowed to change their fundamental focus of their project (although their specific questions are likely to change as the project develops) or change their supervisor unless in highly exceptional circumstances.

      TH629 - Gods and Government from the Roman Empire to Tony Blair

      
      
       Recent cultural and political theories have been haunted by the question of religion, its definitions and functions, its emancipatory capacities, its relation to violence, and its relationship to the history and future of the concept of the secular.  The centrality of religion as a topic for these recent interdisciplinary discussions has emerged in relationship to a growing unease about earlier, modern modes of distinguishing public and private life; a return of religion as an internationally significant political force in recent decades; and surprising appropriations of religion as a figure for secular Western democracy. Theorists (particularly in the area of postcolonial theory) are questioning naturalized or ahistorical distinctions between religion and the secular (e.g., Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Saba Mahmood). Many contemporary thinkers attempt to short-circuit the distinction between religion and politics, making possible surprising paradoxes of a materialist theology (Slavoj iek), an emptied religiosity (Gianni Vattimo), or what Hent de Vries calls simply a political theology. Once we get down beneath the easily-rehearsed stereotypes, we find that the old religious archives (like the Bible) model competing forms of politics: from messianic anarchism to theocracy. In our political historiesand presentsthese have been used (and now are being re-used) in surprising ways.This course considers important moments in the Western history of political theology in order to understand modern and contemporary discussions of secular politics.  These moments will be considered in relation to comparable instances of politically imagined theology (or theologically imagined politics) from other religious traditions as well. Students will:- examine key topics in the modern formation of these discussions (e.g., distinctions between public and private; secular spheres; religion as extra-political ideal; fanaticism; politicized evaluations of Western religion as exceptional in relation to the others; religion and political revolution)- map important similarities and differences between Western and non-Western modelling of the relationship between religion and politics- critically evaluate recent presentations of the inherent violence of religions, the inevitability of the clash of civilizations, and the usefulness of religion in making globalization work

      TH623 - Cracking Biblical Codes: Prophecy, Apocalyptic and Wisdom

      
      
       This module will explore the theme of Biblical Codes from two angles:1) How has the Bible been read as code?2) How can we read/ decode biblical mysteries (prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom) Under heading 1) we will be exploring how different writers and groups (some of them inside the Bible, some of them outside it) have read the Bible as temporal or political code. For example, the biblical book of Daniel attempts to decode the book of Jeremiah, which had already become deeply mysterious to ancient readers. Similarly, the New Testament deciphers biblical prophecy and motifs by applying them to Jesus or the Roman Empire. At the other end of the time spectrum, we find bestsellers like Michael Drosnins The Bible Code (1997), Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHayes attempts to decrypt biblical visions of the end of time by way of contemporary global politics, or recent readings of the book of Ezekiel as prophecies about UFOs. Techniques of decryption are also built into central developments within Jewish and Christian traditions. In fact, what is often called the history of hermeneutics could also be described as the history of How not to read literally. We will be looking at a range of examples of such developments by focusing on readers like Philo of Alexandria, Augustine of Hippo, or Jewish Kabbalah. Under heading 2, we will undertake some in-depth readings of prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom textsthe ones that readers of the Bible find most difficult to decode. Texts to be studied will be taken from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Pseudepigrapha. We will be exploring the contexts that produced these literatures and thinking about how to read (decipher?) them across the abyss of time.

      FR637 - Travels to Japan in Modern French Culture

      
      
       This course examines the portrayal of Japan in French and Belgian writing and culture from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Since Japan was opened to the West in the mid-19th century, there has been a tradition of French literary japanophilia. The course will permit a critical evaluation of the evolution of French japonisme, from its exoticist beginnings in the work of Pierre Loti, through the travel writing of early- and mid- 20th century authors, to  the portrayal of contemporary Japan in Am&eacute;lie Nothombs and Jacques Roubauds work. Japoniste images by French Impressionist painters will also be studied, as will a cinematic adaptation of Nothombs work. The study of these texts and images will involve the exploration of themes such as: intercultural understanding (or the lack thereof); the idealisation or demonisation of the other; the way in which French writers turn to the foreign culture in order to critique their own culture; the nature of Orientalism; genre (what is travel writing? what are its limits?).

      FR621 - Writing on Art: Text and Image in Modern French Culture

      
      
       The eighteenth-century 'philosophe' Denis Diderot was the first major French author to write at length about painting, and he bequeathed to later writers such as Baudelaire a new literary genre, the 'salon'. The mutual influence of literature and the visual arts is a major theme of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French culture, and an important area of current research. The module will begin with a study of a selection of passages from Diderot's 'Salon de1767'. We will then examine Balzac's 'Le Chef d'oeuvre inconnu' and 'Sarrasine', Baudelaire's 'Le Peintre de la vie moderne', Zola's 'L'Oeuvre', a selection from Proust's 'A la recherche du temps perdu', and Georges Perecs 'Un Cabinet damateur.

      FR601 - Mothers and Daughters in Women's Writing

      
      
       The module is designed to acquaint students with samples of the main trends within the work of Twentieth Century Women writers by paying close attention to the relations between mothers and their daughters who become writers. Each novel chosen is one of personal analysis of the often-violent relationship between the mothers and their daughters who turn to writing in a search for identity and liberation from the mother or maternal figure of their youth. Students analyse the texts in order to evaluate how the picture of the mother has evolved. We will pay close attention to the underlying theme of the progression of the role of women in French society. Each text will also provide us with a variety of specific themes to discuss which will enable us to better understand the changes which French women have faced during this century.

      FR613 - The Reader and the Text

      
      
       This module aims to examine literature from an unusual angle by concentrating on the importance of the figure of the reader for the interpretation of novels.  Often novels address the reader directly; some novels are written in the second person, as if the reader were a central character.  Sometimes novels involve self-reflexive or self-referential elements that force the reader to reflect on his/her own expectations of literature.  When novels invoke the reader in these various ways, they invite us to reflect on the text  how it comes to exist, who it is for, what is its message or purpose  in new and challenging ways.  The module also concentrates on the 'nouveau roman', which involves sustained reflection on these and related questions.

      FR645 - Desire in the Text: Romanticism to Decadence

      
      
       This module presents a broadly chronological survey of canonical works of French literature of the nineteenth century centred on the theme of desire. More specifically, these works explore contemporary codes of love and marriage, shifting gender identities, capitalism, consumerism, moral, social and sexual transgression, alienation, lethargy, and death. The module takes fiction of the Romantic era as its starting point, exploring the frustration of desire associated with the mal du si&egrave;cle (the disillusionment and melancholy experienced by (primarily) young adults in the early nineteenth century). It concludes with naturalist and decadent works of the fin de si&egrave;cle, which are concerned with a discrepancy between desire and a generalised depletion of the energy required to fulfil it. The module identifies desire (whether satisfied, unfulfilled or conspicuously absent) as a central preoccupation in French cultural production of the nineteenth century. It also examines the extent to which desire is a strategy for expressing contemporary concerns and anxieties around specific aspects of modern life with which the human subject was coming rapidly and problematically to terms.

      FR646 - Crossing Borders: Travel in Modern French Writing

      
      
       This module will explore the evolution of the notion of travel in modern French thought and literature by looking at a wide range of French travel writing in prose as well as poetry, essays, and travel diaries from the late 19th century to the late 20th century.The objective is to show how travel writing questions the relevance of myths about travel itself (often seen as a means to discover new worlds and to allow different cultures to blend together) or about the other and otherworldliness.The module takes Arthur de Gobineaus and Victor Hugo's fictional travels to the East as a starting point to explore how 19th-century orientalism fed an imaginary, idealised or demonised conception of the other. From there we will move on to different (post)modern texts by Victor Segalen, Henri Michaux and Nicolas Bouvier, demonstrating how travel and writing can work together to cross borders of a cultural but also linguistic and stylistic nature.More specifically, these different works explore themes such as exoticism, (post)modern conceptions of intercultural relationships, opacity, loneliness, fragmentation, and chaotic trajectories.

       This module examines some of the key works of French cinema since 1990. The films in this module will be studied in terms of their cultural background and within the context of French cinema history. While all the films are studied in close detail, students will be invited to develop important themes such as race and national identity, changing perceptions of Paris and the banlieue, and symptoms of social crisis.
