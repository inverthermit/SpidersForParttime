 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SE307 - Thinkers and Theories: An Introduction to theHistory and Development of

      
      
       The module introduces students to the major figures who have shaped the discipline of Anthropology (both socio-cultural and biological) and take them through the historical development of the discipline.  Major thinkers such as Marx, Weber and Durkheim on the one hand, and Linnaeus, Lamarck, Darwin and Mendel on the other, are introduced, and their influence on and contribution to the discipline traced.  The module will provide an historical outline of major schools of thought within Anthropology - evolution, diffusionism, functionalism structuralism, postmodernism, socio-biology, evolutionary psychology - in both Britain and the USA, and examine the relationship between socio-cultural anthropology and biological anthropology from an historical perspective.

      SE313 - Relations: Global Perspectives on Family, Friendship and Care

      
      
       The aim of this module is to introduce students to anthropological thinking on a major field of enquiry that is widely considered to constitute a mainstay core of contemporary social anthropology: systems of relatedness, formally referred to as kinship studies. Here we examine relatedness - family, friendship, community and care  as fundamental yet changing aspects of society and social organization. These topics will be dealt with from historical but mostly contemporary perspectives, providing accounts of the development of social anthropology, and demonstrating the foundational and transformational positions that relatedness continues to hold in the definition of the discipline.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE586 - Ethnographies 1

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of reading four professional ethnographic monographs in their entirety.  The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the thematic topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology I module, i.e. Kinship and Social Organisation, and Economic Systems.  Students will be expected to come to seminars with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology I.  Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier class meetings, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      SE587 - Ethnographies 2

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of professional ethnographic monographs of varying length to be read at the rate of one (or selected substantial parts of one) monograph per week. The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the analytical topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology 2 module, thereby divided into two congruent blocs. These are labelled Power and Authority and Belief and Practice [see Module specification for SE 589]. Students will be expected to come to class with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology 1. Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier classes, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      SE588 - Advanced Social Anthropology 1: Power and Economy

      
      
       The module is a cross-cultural analysis of economic and political institutions, and the ways in which they transform over time. Throughout the term, we draw upon a range of ethnographic research and social theory, to investigate the political and conceptual questions raised by the study of power and economy. The module engages with the development and key debates of political and economic anthropology, and explores how people experience, and acquire power over social and economic resources. Students are asked to develop perspectives on the course material that are theoretically informed and empirically grounded, and to apply them to the political and economic questions of everyday life. The module covers the following topics: the relationship between power and authority; key concepts and theoretical debates in economic anthropology; sharing and egalitarianism; gift exchange; sexual inequality; violence; the nation state; money; social class; work; commodification; financialisation. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE589 - Advanced Social Anthropology II: Religion &  Cosmological Imagination

      
      
       This module is focused on a diverse range of approaches deployed by anthropologists to the study of religion, and belief and symbolic systems. It introduces a range of an-thropological insights to the ongoing transformations of religious traditions and belief systems vis-&agrave;-vis colonial encounters, post-colonial settings, as well as globalisation. The aim of the module is to familiarize students with the complex interactions between lived religious practice, religious traditions, and the ways in which these are intertwined with other domains of social life, politics, economics and ideology. The key topics covered in this module focus on ritual and sacrifice; witchcraft and sorcery; secularisation and fundamentalism; millennialism and conversion; cosmology and ideology; human and non-human relationships; modes of religiosity, rationality and belief; mediation and ethics. This module will develop students awareness of the strengths and limitations of anthropological insights compared to other disciplinary perspectives on religion such as theology, cognitive science or sociology.

  Year abroad

  
   Spend a year between Stages 2 and 3 taking courses in Social Anthropology at a university in Finland (where the courses are taught in English). Students are required to have obtained a Stage 2 average of 60% or above, before commencing their year abroad.

Examples of modules available during your year abroad are available from the School of Anthropology and Conservation website
.

In the unlikely event that force majeure prevents us from placing every student who meets the academic requirement, for example if a partner university is forced to terminate an exchange unexpectedly,  and places become limited, the School/Schools concerned will weigh up applicants' academic performance,  attendance  and individual merit in order to decide who is placed. Individual merit would cover such things as commitment to the degree programme, participation and motivation.

      SE596 - Theoretical Perspectives in Social Anthropology

      
      
       This module aims to develop the anthropological imagination of Stage 3 students, that is, to instill the ability to apprehend theoretical issues and apply them with a critical and informed sense of difference in the human experience.  The module is not a 'history of theory' survey; rather, it will proceed by means of a set of topics through which different theoretical approaches to the same ethnographic problem or issue have been explored.  The module may be organised around a single theme that has long dominated anthropological discussions (such as 'the gift', hierarchy and scale, structure and agency etc.) which will be used as a lens through which to view theoretical discussions within social anthropology as well as its appropriations from other disciplines.

      SE597 - Theoretical Topics in Social Anthropology

      
      
       This module aims to aid Stage III students in making connections between theoretical issues and the ways in which they recur in the practices and debates of social anthropologists. The module teaches theoretical engagement by means of tracking the way that similar problems in ethnographic practice have been approached by different theoretical schools. The module engages a series of themes that illustrate how social anthropologists throughout the history of the discipline, and from different national traditions within the discipline, have engaged with the pressing political and social concerns of their day.

      SE601 - European Societies

      
      
       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE592 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies

      
      
       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

      SE547 - South East Asian Societies

      
      
       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      SE549 - The Anthropology of Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

      SE550 - The Anthropology of Gender

      
      
       This module explores the central historical and contemporary debates in the anthropology of gender, including: the search for universal principles underlying gender inequality (such as nature/culture and domestic/public), relationships between gender, sex, and sexuality, how gender articulates with other indices of difference such as race, class and nation, gendered perspectives on power, the interaction of agency and structure in the production of femininities and masculinities, gender and technology, gender and the state, and gendered modernities.  A key concern of the module will be to understand, discuss and debate how the primarily qualitative methods of ethnographic research can inform and further these debates.  The module will first review the historiography of theoretical developments in the anthropology of gender and feminist anthropology, then move on to consider key classic and contemporary ethnographies to explore how they contribute to our ability to analyse and understand gender.

      SE552 - Culture and Cognition

      
      
       An introduction to cognitive anthropology and a critical exploration of theories concerning the relationship between cognitive processes, culture and social organisation.  The topics covered will include the forming of categories, relations between categories, the symbolic construction of nature, the classification of natural kinds, the convergence of cognitive and symbolic approaches, the evolution of hominid cognitive processes, the development of second order representations, social cognition and classification, spatial orientation, time reckoning and the cultural construction of knowledge.

      SE554 - Visual Anthropology Theory

      
      
       This module is a general introduction to visual anthropology. It includes treatment of cross-cultural cognition and symbolic analysis, the social history of still photography and film relating to ethnographic subjects, the study of national and regional cinematic traditions (outside Europe and America), the comparative ethnography of television and broader consideration of issues of social representation and political ideology in visual imagery, combining empirical ethnographic analysis of these issues with the alternative (complementary) contributions of scholars of visual imagery from a literary and humanistic tradition of interpretation. It includes a short practical introduction to different visual media, but extended practical experience is available only through the project modules.

      SE555 - Project in Visual Anthropology

      
      
       Within the Anthropology degree programme this module represents an optional component of Part II studies, namely the practical study of visual representations. It assumes that students will be taking SE554 Visual Anthropology Theory as a prerequisite. Its distinctiveness relative to the other module is that it focuses principally on the exploration of theoretical issues, through the development of an ethnographic project, focussed on either photography or video and delivered as multimedia. The module requires the making a visual project (a photographic essay, a short ethnographic film) with practical instruction in developing, editing and mounting procedures.Students will be introduced to basic techniques of visual production and presentation. The practical component of the course cannot attempt to provide qualified instruction in professional photographic or video production expertise, and we are narrowly constrained by the limited equipment and technical support available. The visual project is intended to give practical experience of general techniques of visual communication that should critically inform understanding of more theoretical topics dealt with in the module. Techniques of camera use, instruction (theoretical and practical) on research methods, practice and demonstration of visual presentation will all be taught sequentially, and linked to students practical experience in formulating and producing their projects.

      SE556 - Social Sciences in the Classroom

      
      
       This module is a one-term placement opportunity that allows students to teach aspects of their degree subject in a local school. Launched to coincide with Kents 50th anniversary, this module highlights the longstanding excellence of social science research and teaching at the University, and the important role the institution has in contributing to the local community The module will begin with (formative) training sessions (2x3hours) in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the sections of the national curriculum that are degree specific, the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of the specific degree subject. In the Spring term the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a local school. Generally, they will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of their subject area within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project ( in consultation with the teacher and with the local module convener.

      SE565 - Sex Evolution and Human Nature

      
      
       Much of the material presented in this course forms part of the relatively new academic discipline of evolutionary psychology/anthropology. The goal of this course is to discover and understand the principles of evolutionary psychology and other complementary paradigms. The module explores human behaviour (primarily human sexual behaviours) from an evolutionary perspective. Topics covered are reproductive and mating strategies, parenting behaviour, kinship, cooperation, survival, status striving, jealously, and aggression. The course will provide an excellent understanding of the deeply biological nature of human behaviour, and develop skills in critical thinking. Students will be encouraged to bring relevant questions and observations to seminars and time will be allocated to deal with them.Lecture and seminar topics will include: The origins of human nature and evolutionary anthropology Why does sex exist, what does it mean to be a particular sex, and why dont men breast-feed?  What aspects of our personalities are determined by our biological need to reproduce? Why are human beings so intelligent? Viewing humans as a species of ape. What can we learn by studying chimpanzees about ourselves  and our ancestors?  Human mating strategies. Male and female long and short term strategies. The essence of beauty.  Do men and women differ in their natures? If so, are these differences genetic? Adultery. Whats love got to do with it?  Why do humans have a concealed (not advertised) ovulation?  Why is there a menopause?  Sexual conflict and jealousy  Why do we make friends, and what are they good for?

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      SE585 - From the Raw to the Cooked: The Anthropology of Eating

      
      
       Students will learn about the evolution and significance of food production, especially in relation to globalisation, identity and health.  The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development.  it will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation.  Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings.  We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporarary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

       Ethnicity and nationalism are matters of contemporary urgency (as we are daily reminded by the media), but while the meanings of these terms are taken for granted, what actually constitutes ethnicity and nationalism, and how they have been historically constituted, is neither clear nor self-evident. This module begins with a consideration of the major theories of nationalism and ethnicity, and then moves on to a series of case studies taken from various societies around the world., and then moves on to examine a number of other important conceptsindigeneity, race, hybridity, authenticity, invention of tradition, multiculturalism, globalizationthat can help us appreciate the complexity and dynamics of ethnic identities. The general aim of the module is to enable and encourage students to think critically beyond established, homogenous and static ethnic categories.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE575 - Medicinal Plants: Home Remedy, Pharmaceutical, Illicit Drug

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ethnopharmacology, a multidisciplinary field of study that employs chemistry, ecology, biology, pharmacology and anthropology to evaluate and understand the use of plants (and other substances) in non-western medical systems.  While  students will be introduced to all of the disciplines involved in ethnopharmacological research, this module will have a heavy anthropological focus.  Lecture and reading materials will address questions related to the actions of natural products in the human body, the ecological and evolutionary basis of medicinal plants use, the epistemology of non-western medical systems, the efficacy of medicinal plants and the development of pharmaceuticals based on traditional medicines.  Topics discussed in class will provide ideas and models for student   research projects. This module should appeal to students with interests in anthropology  and/or medical care/research. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE593 - Evolution of Human Diversity

      
      
       The nature and extent of the biological diversity observed amongst human populations has been at the heart of anthropological enquiry for centuries. This module will provide an introduction into human phenotypic and genetic diversity across the globe.  Biological anthropologists today use a variety of analytical models and techniques drawn from population and quantitative genetics in order to analyse human biological diversity in a meaningful way. Students will be introduced to these such that the complexities of evolutionary ecological theory are readily understood. Students will learn the extent to which humans have adapted to various environmental conditions as well as understanding the effects of recent demographic changes and population expansions. Students will also learn how human adaptations affect ecological patterns in the species that interact with human populations. This facilitates a direct comparison with other ecological patterns while placing human diversity in broad comparative perspective. This also serves as a platform for critically evaluating claims of human ecological or evolutionary uniqueness.  

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE594 - Anthropology and Development

      
      
       Primarily intended to offer a critical analysis of the concept of development, particularly as it is used to talk about economic and social change in the developing world, the module shows how anthropological knowledge and understanding can illuminate 'development issues' such as rural poverty, environmental degradation, international aid and humanitarian assistance, climate change and the globalization of trade.  Topics discussed include the role of anthropology in development practice, by examining some of the methods being used to either study or participate in current development projects, whether at local, national or international levels of intervention. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE595 - Social Computing

      
      
       In this module you will learn how people are using social computing resources, how anthropologists and others understand these activities, how to access and deploy these resources yourself, and how to leverage your participation to better understand social and cultural processes that are underway in social computing contexts.In Social Computing we describe and analyse how people use and adapt new technologies to form and navigate cultural and social contexts, create and spread knowledge and undertake action emerging from computer-enhanced capabilities.  Capabilities include the internet (including so call Web 2.0), clouds, augmented reality, robotics and virtual devices, wearable computers and sensors and artificial intelligence.We begin by looking at the major theoretical paradigms and methods that have guided research on these in anthropology and related disciplines.  In the remainder of the module we examine case studies of social computing based on different capabilities, using a took-kit that supports the creation and analysis of social computing capabilities and developing group and individual contributions to an on-going collective module project that will contribute to the Social Computing context.Topics considered include the creative commons of open source, Web 2.0 and resource clouds, social networks, organisational change, reputation, social, lgel and ethical issues, mobile and ubiquitous computing and argmented reality.  Topics discussed in class will provide ideas and models for student research projects.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE752 - Anthropology of Creativity

      
      
       This module critically surveys anthropological approaches to creativity and creative expressionselected from research on creativity itself, and on the anthropology of art and literature (both oral and written).  We explore three fields of creative practice as they relate to contemporary anthropology. 1) We review classic approaches to the anthropology of art, in both non-Western and Western contexts. We assess recent breakthroughs which challenge the borders between artistic and ethnographic discourse, exploring how the ethnographic encounter can be rethought via dialogue with contemporary artists. 2) We review the anthropology of literature, and assess both pioneering forms of literary expression in the work of anthropologists, and the output of anthropological practitioners of literary fiction and poetry. 3) We examine how anthropology itself can be conceptualised as the creative expression of an encounter with others, lived experience, and the unknown, and explore the implications for anthropological modes of representation (including public anthropology). Students have the option to develop a creative project during the module that builds on this training, and can submit both academic and practice-led creative anthropological research as their assessment.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE534 - Special Project in Social Anthropology

      
      
       This module offers Stage 3 students the opportunity to design, execute, and write up a dissertation project of their own devising.  Students may pursue a module of library-based research under supervision on a particular topic and/or undertake limited ethnographic research on that topic.  The topic, and the way it is researched, will be of the students own choosing.  All projects must be supervised by a member of staff in Social Anthropology, with whom the student has arranged to work before registering for the module.  Students who wish to do a project on this module should collect the information sheet from the School Undergraduate Office during Stage 2 (this includes students on a Year Abroad programme) not later than then end of the online module registration period in the Spring Term.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
