Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.

For the  first four  years, you  follow the course structure of the  BA in Digital Arts with a Year in Industry.

Most modules consist of a mix of lectures, seminars, studio work, computer sessions and private study. The workstations in our computer suites are equipped with current industry-standard software.

In the  fifth  year, you  take seven 15-credit modules based on our existing MSc provision, with the opportunity to specialise by taking optional modules from our Computer Animation or Digital Visual Effects MSc programmes. An additional 15-credit project module  runs in the spring term.

       Animation Principles is a 15 credit module concerned with fundamental animation concepts. Originally developed by Hollywood animators in the 1940s, these principles have been derived from classical drawn animation and model animation, transposed into the digital medium. Topics covered include: Rules of Thumb...anticipation, action, reaction, keys and breakdowns, successive breaking of joints, breaking up actions. Bouncing Ball...timing, spacing, squash and stretch. Weight...indicating force and mass, strain, judders, release. Line of Action...arcs, intentionality of movement. Secondary Animation...overlapping actions, cloth, hair, wave motions, spline deformations. Effects...dynamics in particles and rigid bodies, fields, fluids. Delivery is by means of Lectures, Demonstrations, Workshops and Assessed Practical Assignments.

       This module is 15 credit module focused on a sequence of practical workshops which introduce the editing and compositing tools used on the course and is supported by a series of lectures concerned with high definition video technology. Students gain an understanding of the theory and standards of colour models, and how they are applied to motion imaging in video, HDTV and digital-cinema and become familiar with the relevant broadcast and compression standards that are used for high definition digital video. In addition, students work together in teams of 4 or 5 students to produce a short digital film which includes high definition video footage and composited effects.

      EL833 - Visual Training

      
      
       The exact configuration which makes up a particular facial expression, the exact state of the muscles of a body under different circumstances, the exact nuance of meaning conveyed by different gesture positions, are all elements that go to distinguish superior from mediocre animation. The most effective way to develop such observational and outputting skills is through traditional drawing and sculpture, which is frequently reflected in studio hiring policies. This 15 credit module uses traditional art techniques to develop the students digital animation abilities. Delivery is by means of Lectures, Demonstrations, Workshops, and Life Drawing Classes and is marked on the production of a portfolio of artwork: drawings, a sculpture, 2D and 3D sequences, created over a series of practical assignments.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EL865 - Action in Animation

      
      
       Action in Animation is a 15 credit module concerned with the techniques used to produce articulate motion which is life-like and convincing - this is the base of both comedic cartoon animation and realistic animation for compositing as in creating realistic stunts or armies for action and historical spectaculars, where cost or danger prohibit live shooting. Students completing the module will be able to create convincing human, animal and bird locomotion of all kinds, create transitions between different speeds and different modes, reuse this animation by repositioning it and putting it on motion paths, and co-ordinate this repositioning and path animation on a large scale in crowd or herd staging.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EL866 - Acting in Animation

      
      
       This 15 credit module allows you to develop a wellrounded understanding of how thoughts and emotions are clearly and engagingly conveyed using 3D character models. In order to be a good character animator, one must not merely copy performances and reproduce them; one must be an actor through the technology and the techniques available to the animator. Like acting, there are two main ways of developing this - the external observation of behaviour, gesture and expressions, and the internal use of ones own emotional experiences to breathe life into a performance. The aim of this module is to sharpen the students approach to both of these under the guidance of an experienced veteran character animator.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EL867 - Technical Direction

      
      
       This 15 credit module is concerned with the use of lighting and shading for storytelling and visual communication. Students will gain an understanding of the fundamental, theoretical concepts in digital lighting as well as gain the necessary skills and experience to produce customized light and shading models which provide aesthetic possibilities not available from "off-the-shelf" packages. Undertaking this module students become expert in the use of the Mental Ray renderer.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EL868 - High Definition Compositing

      
      
       This 15 credit module specifically addresses the technical and artistic requirements for compositing video and 3D elements at a high resolution. Compositing is the artistic blending of several disparate elements from a variety of sources into a single image while making all the component elements appear to be in the same light space and shot with the same camera. On successful completion of the module, working at a high definition resolution, you will be able to composite a moving digital video element from one or more clips seamlessly into another; change seamlessly lightings, camera moves and framings, colour balances and film textures on existing digital video clips; build and match camera movements of 3D environments from and to the 2D evidence in digital video clips; model, texture, animate and light a 3D computer graphics object for seamless compositing into a live action digital video clip.

      EL869 - Film and Video Production

      
      
       This module introduces students to the key elements of film form and film-making technique. It provides them with the opportunity to look at their MSc work within the broader context of film art, and to learn basic film-making skills including screenwriting, camerawork, sound recording, and editing. Classes will comprise a mixture of practical workshops and seminars focused on how film-makers uses specific cinematic techniques including narrative construction, visual composition, camera motion, colour, sound, and editing. Students will have a chance to experiment with these techniques by working in small groups to produce a short dramatic film work.
