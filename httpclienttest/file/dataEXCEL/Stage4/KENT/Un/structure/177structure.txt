      MA629 - Probability and Inference

      
      
       This module develops the techniques introduced in the first year probability and statistics modules, and lays the foundation for several third year statistics modules. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations.  The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module.  Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  All of these have been introduced in the first year statistics module.  The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation.  Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, etc.  Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables.  Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution.  Principles of statistical inference.  Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency).  Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments.  Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test.  Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.

      MA552 - Analysis

      
      
       The concept of a limit is basic to Calculus and, unless this concept is defined precisely, uncertainties and paradoxes will creep into the subject. Based on the foundation of the real number system, this module develops the theory of convergence of sequences and series and the study of continuity and differentiability of functions. The notion of Riemann integration is also explored. The syllabus includes the following: Sequences and their convergence. The convergence of bounded increasing sequences. Series and their convergence: the comparison test, the ratio test, absolute and conditional convergence, the alternating series test. Continuous functions: the boundedness theorem, the Intermediate Value Theorem. Differentiable functions: The Mean Value Theorem with applications, power series, Taylor expansions. Construction and properties of the Riemann integral.

      MA565 - Groups and Rings

      
      
       Groups are sets with a single binary operation.  They arise as symmetry groups in contexts from puzzles like Rubiks cube to chemistry, where they help list molecules with a given number of atoms involved.  In contrast, rings have two binary operations, generalising the arithmetic of integer numbers. This part of algebra has many applications in electronic communication, in particular in coding theory and cryptography.

      MA588 - Mathematical Techniques and Differential Equations

      
      
       Most physically interesting problems are governed by ordinary, or partial differential equations.  It is examples of such equations that provide the motivation for the material covered in this module, and there is a strong emphasis on physical applications throughout. The aim of the module is to provide a firm grounding in mathematical methods: both for solving differential equations and, through the study of special functions and asymptotic analysis, to determine the properties of solutions. The module will provide invaluable to anybody who later takes third year options in asymptotics, numerical analysis or differential equations.The following topics will be covered: Ordinary differential equations: method of Frobenius, general linear second order differential equation.

      MA584 - Computational Mathematics

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide an introduction to the methods, tools and ideas of numerical computation. In applications mathematics frequently generates specific instances of standard problems for which there are no easily obtainable analytic solutions. Examples might be the task of determining the value of a particular integral, or of finding the roots of a certain non-linear equation. Methods are presented for solving such problems on a modern computer. Besides a description of the basic numerical procedure, each method is analysed in terms of when it best works, how it compares with alternative approaches, and the way it may be implemented on a computer. Numerical computations are almost invariably contaminated by errors, and an important concern throughout the module is to understand the source, propagation and magnitude of these errors.The syllabus will cover: Introduction to numerics; solutions of equations in one variable; interpolation and polynomial approximation; numerical differentiation; numerical integration; direct methods for solving linear systems; iterative techniques for solving linear systems.

      MA632 - Regression Models

      
      
       The aims of the module are to introduce the students to the theory and practice of regression, and associated linear model techniques. Quite often experimenters and researchers wish to express a response variable y as a function of some other (explanatory) variables. For example, y might be the yield of a chemical process and the explanatory variables might be temperature and pressure. Knowing the relationship would enable y to be predicted for particular values of temperature and pressure. In this module the method of deriving such a relationship will be that of least squares and the theoretical and practical aspects of this method will be covered in some detail. There will be opportunity for students to use computer programs.The module covers most of the following topics: definition of the linear model and regression, least squares estimates, sums of squares, expectations, properties of estimators, the ANOVA table, standard errors and confidence intervals for parameters, residuals, diagnostics, regression with two explanatory variables, matrix formulation of the model, multiple regression, extra sum of squares principle, use of MINITAB, model selection strategies, introduction to analysis of variance.

      MA587 - Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

      
      
       Most differential equations which arise from physical systems can not be solved explicitly in closed form, and thus numerical solutions are an invaluable way to obtain information about the underlying physical system. The first half of the module is concerned with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several different numerical methods are introduced and error growth is studied. Both initial value and boundary value problems are investigated.  The second half of the module deals with the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The syllabus includes initial value problems for ODEs, Taylor methods, Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, error bounds and stability.  Boundary value problems for ODEs, shooting methods and finite difference schemes.  Partial Differential Equations, difference schemes, iterative methods, stability analysis and the method of lines.

      MA771 - Applied Stochastic Modelling and Data Analysis

      
      
       The module starts with an introduction to a range of atypical data sets, drawn from areas such as ecology, biology, genetics and psychology.  Each of the examples can be described by a suitable stochastic model, making use of the known background to the data, and built on the axioms of probability theory. Fitting models to data is traditionally accomplished by the method of maximum likelihood, and typically this involves numerical optimisation. The labour involved here is only feasible using a computer, and integral to the module is the use of the MATLAB integrated computer package. The module also describes modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, and MATLAB is again very useful for illustrating these methods in operation. In supervised computer practical classes you will gain experience with running a range of computer programs for modern methods of statistical analysis.

      MA772 - Analysis of Variance

      
      
       This module will build on the material on linear-models covered in the module, MA632 Regression.   Analysis of variance is a fundamentally important method for the statistical analysis of data.  It is used widely in biological, medical, psychological, sociological and industrial research.  In analysing experimental data, the appropriate form of analysis of variance is determined by the design of the experiment, and we shall therefore discuss some aspects of experimental design in this module.  Lectures are supplemented by computing classes which explore the analysis of variance facilities of the statistical package R. Syllabus: One-way ANOVA (fixed effects model); alternative models; least squares estimation; expectations of mean squares; distributional results; ANOVA table; follow-up analysis; multiple comparisons; least significant difference; confidence intervals; contrasts; orthogonal polynomials; checking assumptions; residual plots; Bartletts test; transformations; one-way ANOVA (random effects model); types of experiment; experimental and observational units; treatment structure; randomisation; replication; blocking; the size of an experiment; two-way ANOVA; the randomised complete block design; two-way layout with interaction; the general linear model; matrix formulation; models of full rank; constraints; motivations for using least squares; properties of estimators; model partitions; extra sum of squares principle; orthogonality; multiple regression; polynomial regression; comparison of regression lines; analysis of covariance; balanced incomplete block designs; Latin square designs; Youden rectangles; factorial experiments; main effects and interactions

      MA781 - Practical Multivariate Analysis

      
      
       Many statistical problems (in biology and psychology, for example) are multivariate, in that more than one measurement is made on each individual under study.  For example, we may be given scores on several different tests, or the levels of several chemicals in the blood.Some statistical techniques for analysing multivariate data are extensions of standard univariate techniques. Other techniques are concerned with the relationships between variables; they lead, in conjunction with modern computing techniques, to a wide variety of descriptive and exploratory tools.In this module, students will attend about 20 lectures and classes designed to introduce all the major concepts and techniques of multivariate analysis, and will do some reading and undertake a small project designed to deepen their appreciation of some of the methodology.Syllabus: Random variables and their properties; The Multivariate Normal (MN) distribution; Partial and multiple correlation; Sampling distributions based on MN; Inference for  the  MN  distribution; including  Hotelling's  T2 and multivariate analysis of variance; Likelihood ratio and Union-intersection methods; Discriminant analysis; Principal component analysis and Factor Analysis; Scaling and rotation of factors; Canonical analysis; Metric and non-metric scaling.  Methods of cluster analysis.

      MA591 - Nonlinear Systems and Mathematical Biology

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the study of properties of solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, difference equations and their application to problems in Biology. Topics covered include continuous population models, discrete population models (including the onset of chaos), interacting population models (including predator-prey, competition and mutualism models), reaction kinetics and reaction-diffusion models. The emphasis will be on developing an understanding of nonlinear systems and using practical analytical techniques to analyse them. The module will utilise biological models to illustrate the theory and give an insight into how Mathematics can be of practical use in the study of phenomena which are observed in the real world and include some recent developments in this field. The development will bring together several aspects of Mathematics - analytic, geometric and numerical ideas, as well as computation through the use of MAPLE.The module will cover topics in the following areas: Introduction to nonlinear systems and Mathematical Biology; Continuous population models for single species; Discrete population models; Phase plane analysis; Continuous models for Interacting Populations; Stability, instability and limit cycles; Reaction kinetics; Reaction-diffusion models; Reaction-diffusion (Turing) mechanisms.

      MA567 - Topology

      
      
       This module is an introduction to point-set topology, a topic that is relevant to many other areas of mathematics. In it, students will be looking at the concept of topological spaces and related constructions. In an Euclidean space, an "open set" is defined as a (possibly infinite) union of open "epsilon-balls". A topological space generalises the notion of "open set" axiomatically, leading to some interesting and sometimes surprising geometric consequences. For example, we will encounter spaces where every sequence of points converges to every point in the space, see why for topologists a doughnut is the same as a coffee cup, and have a look at famous objects such as the Moebius strip or the Klein bottle.

      MA572 - Complex Analysis

      
      
       The module is concerned with complex functions, that is functions which are both defined for and assume complex values.  Their theory follows a quite different development from that of real functions, is remarkable in its directness and elegance, and leads to many useful applications.Topics covered will include: Complex numbers. Domains and simple connectivity.  Integration and  Cauchys theorem.  Singularities and residues.  Applications.

      MA574 - Polynomials in Several Variables

      
      
       This module provides a rigorous foundation for the solution of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  In the 1890s, David Hilbert proved four ground-breaking theorems that prepared the way for Emmy Noether's famous foundational work in the 1920s on ring theory and ideals in abstract algebra.  This module will echo that historical progress, developing Hilbert's theorems and the essential canon of ring theory in the context of polynomial rings.  It will take a modern perspective on the subject, using the Groebner bases developed in the 1960s together with ideas of computer algebra pioneered in the 1980s. The syllabus will be: Multivariate polynomials, monomial orders, division algorithm, Groebner basis; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and its meaning and consequences for solving polynomials in several variables; Elimination theory and applications; Linear equations over systems of polynomials, syzygies, discussion of Hilbert's Syzygies Theorem, its proof and applications. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other applications.  Depending on time, these may include: invariants of group actions, linear PDEs, combinatorics and the Stanley-Reisner ring, and algebraic codes.

      MA549 - Discrete Mathematics

      
      
       Recently, with the rapid developments in IT, in particular in electronic communication systems, some quite surprising new applications have been found for Discrete Mathematics (as opposed to the Continuous Mathematics based on the calculus). Thus methods for the encoding of information in order to safeguard against eavesdropping or distortion by noise have involved using some basic results from modular arithmetic, polynomial algebra and the theory of finite fields. The module will provide a self-contained introduction to this general area and will cover most of the following topics:(a)   Modular arithmetic, polynomials and finite fields: Applications to orthogonal Latin squares, RSA public key ciphers, coin-tossing over a telephone, linear feedback shift registers and m-sequences.(b)   Error correcting codes: Binary block, linear and cyclic codes including repetition, parity-check, Hamming, simplex; Reed-Muller - BCH - Golay - and other codes; channel capacity; Maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, syndrome and algebraic decoding.
