      AR546 - Technology 4

      
      
       The aim of the module is to promote a comprehensive understanding of sustainability in which cost factors and environmental impact are considered inextricably bound into its definition. The lecture course covers the following areas: architecture from a global perspective, research methodologies, sustainability criteria in construction and environmental design, benchmarking and legislation in technical design, integration of structure, services and passive environmental features, reviewing the performance of technical design solution, the passive house and its technical challenges, technology from socio-cultural and economic, financial and cost control perspectives. Students can elect one of two thematic approaches and demonstrate that they have met the Learning Outcomes through a written Case Study essay and verbal presentation of its content to a panel of critics, as a critical evaluation of the effectiveness of technologies in one or a series of buildings:Option 1: Technologies and their application in architecture (Design)Students investigate the challenges associated with the application of particular technologies in actual buildings with integrating construction and environmental design strategies. Students are required to analyse how cost factors shape the design process, both in regards to construction cost, specification strategy, and in relation to operational energy use in the post-construction phase.Option 2: Technology in the cultural context (Policy) Students are required to consider how the wider cultural context of regulation, statutory legislative frameworks, procurement mechanisms, national economic incentives, and voluntary certification schemes all have an impact on building technology. Students develop an advanced understanding of design, technical factors, financial and cost control mechanisms which operate before, during and after the development of a project.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      AR647 - Technology 5

      
      
       This technology portfolio further develops how the concurrent and parallel design module (or exceptionally a design project already completed in a previous MArch design module) would be realised in terms of the technology and environmental considerations of the building programme. It further develops, demonstrates and integrates the building technologies and environmental control strategies underlying the design project. Each student is to produce a series of technical detail drawings from Scales 1:20  1: 5, together with a physical model of a key part of their building, for instance a section through the envelope at a corner, at a scale of 1:20 or as directed by the module convener. Students have to demonstrate a developed ability to critically evaluate and refine technical propositions through an iterative process. Additionally design drawings and models will be expected to demonstrate an advanced consideration for and provision of technology addressing the environmental exposure, temperature control, waterproofing, ventilation, circulation, structural support and integration, and sensibilities and sensitivities to appropriate building construction technologies. This will include an articulated attitude to the use of Material Tectonics. Students will need to summarise the iterative process and the final solution through clearly annotated drawings, sketches and models (both presentation and working models) appropriately.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      AR600 - Architectural Pedagogy

      
      
       One of three optional modules taught in Autumn Term of stage 5, this module aims to provide students with a formal programme in teaching architectural design and communication. Students will develop a good understanding of architectural pedagogy, first through practical experience in first year undergraduate studio teaching and second through research in higher education. The focus is on teaching and learning models specific to architecture, such as studio-based tutorials and design reviews. The module is taught through a combination of lectures, tutorials, group seminars and review sessions. Teaching and assessment of this module is divided into two components: 1) theory of architectural education 2) teaching practice. For the theory component students produce an academic essay based on a topic in architectural education. Through these essays students will explore a particular area of architectural education in greater depth. Students will choose a topic in consultation with the module convenor and will develop their research over the course of the term. Feedback is provided during weekly tutorials and two formative review sessions. During the reviews students will present their research and receive feedback from a panel of critics. In Autumn Term weekly lectures and a series of group seminars will be provided, introducing students to (a) educational theories and models of architectural education (b) research methodologies in education and (c) practical pedagogical methods used in studio teaching. For the practical component stage 5 students take on the role of Teaching Assistants throughout the first year undergraduate programme under the supervision of a dedicated studio tutors and the module convenor.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      AR601 - Artefact

      
      
       Students following this module  focus their research question around making and assembling an artefact, as a piece of research-through-practice, together with a 3500 word written essay in combination with the submission of the artefact., which it will frame and discuss theoretically. The module comprises 10 half-hour bi-weekly tutorials to develop an individual, integrated written and artefactual investigation with an assigned tutor; students develop a research question related to architecture or another field of environmental/spatial design. Students are expected to develop their ability to gather and synthesize data, as well as to analyse it in a coherent and convincing manner. In addition, they are expected to situate their own investigation in the broader context of architectural history, culture, and discourse.
