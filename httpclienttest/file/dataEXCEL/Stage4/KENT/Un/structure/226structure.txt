      DI304 - Economic and Environmental Systems

      
      
       Economic growth and the environmental are intimately linked. With climate change threatening our current way of life and global biodiversity we need to understand the linkages between economic activity and the environment in order to avert catastrophic changes.  This module explains these links and possible solutions to climate change and other threats.  In Part 1, we consider the evolution of the earth and the environmental processes that determine past and present patterns of biodiversity. In Part II we look at how human-environment interactions and specifically consider the role of market forces in determining resource use and in the creation of environmental problems. In Part III we investigate contemporary environmental problems and explore possible solutions through various market and government mechanisms such as carbon trading, environmental taxation and new forms of consumerism.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI305 - Biodiversity

      
      
       This module will introduce a range of fundamental concepts that underpin our understanding of biodiversity and, therefore, the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The differences and similarities between the multiple definitions for the term biodiversity will be considered, in addition to examining how scientists are trying to assess the magnitude of biodiversity on the planet. Spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity will be investigated, along with the importance of biodiversity (both use and non-values). The module will then explore the contemporary threats to biodiversity and provision of associated ecosystem services, in conjunction with a broad overview of the methods conservationists employ to protect and maintain biodiversity.

      DI311 - The Green Planet

      
      
       The module will begin with the question of what defines a plant and how they are related to the other kingdoms. This will then lead on to a journey from the plant cell to vegetation communities and how they interact with, and are important to other groups of organisms. The module will then finish with a discussion surrounding the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (from the Convention on Biological Diversity) and the targets within this document.

      SE307 - Thinkers and Theories: An Introduction to theHistory and Development of

      
      
       The module introduces students to the major figures who have shaped the discipline of Anthropology (both socio-cultural and biological) and take them through the historical development of the discipline.  Major thinkers such as Marx, Weber and Durkheim on the one hand, and Linnaeus, Lamarck, Darwin and Mendel on the other, are introduced, and their influence on and contribution to the discipline traced.  The module will provide an historical outline of major schools of thought within Anthropology - evolution, diffusionism, functionalism structuralism, postmodernism, socio-biology, evolutionary psychology - in both Britain and the USA, and examine the relationship between socio-cultural anthropology and biological anthropology from an historical perspective.

      SE313 - Relations: Global Perspectives on Family, Friendship and Care

      
      
       The aim of this module is to introduce students to anthropological thinking on a major field of enquiry that is widely considered to constitute a mainstay core of contemporary social anthropology: systems of relatedness, formally referred to as kinship studies. Here we examine relatedness - family, friendship, community and care  as fundamental yet changing aspects of society and social organization. These topics will be dealt with from historical but mostly contemporary perspectives, providing accounts of the development of social anthropology, and demonstrating the foundational and transformational positions that relatedness continues to hold in the definition of the discipline.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

      DI303 - Survey and Monitoring for Biodiversity

      
      
       The broad aim of this module is to provide students with practical field experience in wildlife conservation monitoring and assessment methods. Specific aims are to introduce students to a range of basic field techniques and develop their skills in the collection, analysis and presentation of field data.  The module provides an essential practical element of the Biodiversity Conservation and Management programme.The module is offered as an intensive one-week residential field course during the Easter Vacation.  Groups of students will undertake five-day surveys and monitoring projects under the supervision of members of staff.  Each project will assess the biodiversity of an appropriate taxonomic group (such as invertebrates, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles and plants) in either a terrestrial or freshwater habitat.  Students will be expected to arrive at an appropriate design for data collection in discussion with their supervisor, carry out the survey, analyse the data and present a short seminar on their results at the end of the week.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI508 - Skills for Conservation Biologists (Field trip)

      
      
       The most important skill of a field biologist is to be able to correctly interpret the biological meaning of their data. This course is designed to introduce and re-affirm statistical concepts, and their correct use and relevance to field biologists. Throughout this taught module, emphasis will be placed on practical application of statistics as much as possible, and when and how they are applied. Since there is both a theoretical and practical component to this module, students should aim to link the theory presented in lectures with the practical sessions and field trip parts of the course. By the end of the module, students should have a knowledge of the underlying principles of biological statistics, be able to evaluate from a theoretical stand-point and in practise, statistical results, and have a sound appreciation of the benefits and limitations of different statistical techniques and their application to field biology.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI528 - Conservation Social Science: Methods and Research Design

      
      
       This module introduces students to social science methods and research design - an increasingly important area of expertise in conservation, both in academia and in professional practice.  Students will gain basic training and practical experience in the design and use of (a) qualitative interviews and (b) questionnaires.  Sessions will also be devoted to processing and analysis of qualitative data, and also basic descriptive statistics to analyse quantitative data, but not inferential statistics, since this is covered elsewhere in the BSc programme (DI508).  Towards the end of the module we will look in more depth at the principles of research design in order to help students begin to plan their final year research projects.

      DI530 - Spatial Analysis: Principles and Methods

      
      
       The overall aim of this module is to provide students with an outline of the principals of Spatial Analysis and to introduce a range of methods for collection and analysis of spatial data. Particular attention is paid to the development of students analysis skills through the use of remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS are increasingly being used in wildlife conservation and environmental sciences in general to help solve a wide range of real world environmental and associated social problems. As the current trend in ecological studies moves towards the acquisition manipulation and analysis of large datasets with explicit geographic reference, employers often report shortages of relevant GIS skills to handle spatial data. Thus, this module will introduce the use of GIS as a means of solving spatial problems and the potential of GIS and remote sensing techniques for wildlife conservation providing the student with marketable skills relevant to research and commercial needs. Topics will include: understanding the major concepts in Spatial Analysis;  introduction to the principles of GIS;  introduction to remote sensing  data structures in GIS;  data sources and methods of data acquisition  georeferencing, co-ordinate systems and projections  working with raster and vector data mapping (how to create and transform maps), ArcGIS -overview of ArcGIS, ArcMap, ArcCatalog; ArcToolbox, Spatial Analyst. GIS operations (Calculating area, Intersection of polygons etc) manipulation, spatial data query and analysis of a wide range of environmental and socio-economic information relevant to wildlife conservationThese topics will be taught using a combination of lectures and practicals. The practical classes will provide hands-on experience using ArcGIS which is the most widely used GIS system. Students will be able to use knowledge and skills acquired in this module in practical project work.

      SE547 - South East Asian Societies

      
      
       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      SE549 - The Anthropology of Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

      SE601 - European Societies

      
      
       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

      SE592 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies

      
      
       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

      SE593 - Evolution of Human Diversity

      
      
       The nature and extent of the biological diversity observed amongst human populations has been at the heart of anthropological enquiry for centuries. This module will provide an introduction into human phenotypic and genetic diversity across the globe.  Biological anthropologists today use a variety of analytical models and techniques drawn from population and quantitative genetics in order to analyse human biological diversity in a meaningful way. Students will be introduced to these such that the complexities of evolutionary ecological theory are readily understood. Students will learn the extent to which humans have adapted to various environmental conditions as well as understanding the effects of recent demographic changes and population expansions. Students will also learn how human adaptations affect ecological patterns in the species that interact with human populations. This facilitates a direct comparison with other ecological patterns while placing human diversity in broad comparative perspective. This also serves as a platform for critically evaluating claims of human ecological or evolutionary uniqueness.

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

      SE552 - Culture and Cognition

      
      
       An introduction to cognitive anthropology and a critical exploration of theories concerning the relationship between cognitive processes, culture and social organisation.  The topics covered will include the forming of categories, relations between categories, the symbolic construction of nature, the classification of natural kinds, the convergence of cognitive and symbolic approaches, the evolution of hominid cognitive processes, the development of second order representations, social cognition and classification, spatial orientation, time reckoning and the cultural construction of knowledge.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

      SE580 - Primate Behaviour and Ecology

      
      
       This module introduces students to the discipline of behavioural ecology, with particular reference to non-human primates. The module looks at the patterns and principles that can be generalised from the variation in behaviour and ecology across primate species. Set within an evolutionary behavioural-ecological framework, this module combines established findings with the latest research. It emphasises the importance of direct observations of primate behaviour and the use of theoretical models with which to make sense of these data. The module covers social and reproductive behaviour within primate groups, the nature and evolution of primate societies, and cognition and communication, as well as interactions between primates and their environments: primates as foragers, predators and prey. The module will make particular use of multi-media technology to allow students to see and hear primates in their natural habitats.

      SE585 - From the Raw to the Cooked: The Anthropology of Eating

      
      
       Students will learn about the evolution and significance of food production, especially in relation to globalisation, identity and health.  The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development.  it will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation.  Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings.  We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporarary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

      DI531 - Human Wildlife Conflict and Resource Competition

      
      
       Human-wildlife conflicts and resource competition imply costs on human social, economic or cultural life and on the ecological, social or cultural life of wildlife concerned, often to the detriment of conservation objectives and socio-economic realities. This module aims to introduce students to the magnitude and multidisciplinary dimensions of human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) and resource competition, and current approaches and challenges in mitigating and preventing HWC. We will explore how theoretical frameworks for approaching HWC are most often confined within disciplinary boundaries and how more holistic approaches can better equip conservationists and other professionals in dealing with the issue. Using a variety of teaching and learning methods, students will learn about issues involved in determining and analysing HWC, and planning, implementing and evaluating conflict mitigation or prevention schemes.

      DI532 - Creative Conservation

      
      
       Creative Conservation will engage students with a range of ways of thinking critically about conservation issues and their communication whilst developing their own creative practice and skills portfolio. The approach will seek to take a truly interdisciplinary approach, exploring these issues form a range of disciplinary perspectives and seeking syntheses and new imaginings in addressing them. Topics of focus will be chosen from amongst: History of place and the relationship with nature  esp. East Kent and the Blean Photography - and the use of the still image Video - as representation and a research tool Art and Conservation - craftwork, eco-regional design and natural resource utilisation The Wildlife Documentary - a critical deconstruction and analysis Conservation, Religion and Culture Campaigning for Conservation Conservation and Agriculture Literature and Storytelling Conservation and Cuisine - benefit or burden to the conservation mission? Performance Ethnography - a theoretical framework for action research in conservationIn each case the theoretical, as well as the applied practical aspects of the topic will form a core component of the learning and teaching.

      DI535 - Tropical Ecology and Conservation

      
      
       This residential module is designed to provide students with first-hand experience of ecological processes, biodiversity and conservation issues associated with humid tropical environments. Tropical rainforests are the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth and the loss of rainforest is of tremendous conservation concern, both due to loss of diversity as well as its consequences for global warming. Topics to be covered in the curriculum include: Ecological processes and services in tropical rainforests including nutrient cycling, decomposition, pollination and seed dispersal.  Rainforest structure and defining characteristics of pristine and disturbed habitats.  Rainforest community ecology and tropical forests as centres of ecological diversification and biodiversity. Practical training in ecological techniques and survey methods for a range of terrestrial taxonomic groups.  Anthropogenic factors affecting rainforests including logging, fragmentation, global warming & agriculture.The module will take place in a field studies centre at a rainforest location where there is an adequate infrastructure to ensure an acceptable standard of logistical support and health and safety conditions. Students will spend time working in forest and non-forest systems, and there will be an emphasis on practical training in ecological survey and assessment methods. Teaching on conservation will be integrated with short visits to surrounding sites to gain direct appreciation of the issues, problems and solutions surrounding rainforests and their wildlife. Participation in the module will be dependent on maintaining a clean disciplinary record during registration on the degree programme prior to the module. These requirements may be waived in individual cases at the discretion of the module and programme convenors where we judge that there is a strong case for allowing the student onto the module.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI522 - Research Project

      
      
       The module is considered as an important element of Wildlife Conservation undergraduate training.  The opportunity to engage in personal research is seen as an essential element of academic training in all disciplines.  The particular skills necessary to undertake research, whether practical fieldwork or laboratory work or a desk-based study, can only be taught through the medium of practically orientated investigative tasks.  The principle objective in the research project is to assist students in gaining insight into the organisation, analysis and communication of research.  The approved investigation may be novel i.e. one that has not previously been carried out, or it may repeat previously executed work for comparative or control purposes.   

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SE594 - Anthropology and Development

      
      
       Primarily intended to offer a critical analysis of the concept of development, particularly as it is used to talk about economic and social change in the developing world, the module shows how anthropological knowledge and understanding can illuminate 'development issues' such as rural poverty, environmental degradation, international aid and humanitarian assistance, climate change and the globalization of trade.  Topics discussed include the role of anthropology in development practice, by examining some of the methods being used to either study or participate in current development projects, whether at local, national or international levels of intervention.

      DI501 - Climate Change and Conservation

      
      
       This module will inform students how climate has influenced the diversity of life on Earth, from past to present. The role that anthropogenic factors have played in contemporary climate change since the commencement of the industrial era will be examined in detail, in addition to considering their possible effect on future climatic scenarios. The impact of climate change on individual organisms, populations and communities will be investigated, with particular emphasis given to understanding how species are responding. Human impacts from and vulnerabilities to global warming will also be considered. The module will explore how conservation biologists are using particular interventions to ameliorate the most harmful and destabilising effects of climate change. From a more general perspective, the social, economic and political ways in which climate change can be mitigated will be assessed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE585 - From the Raw to the Cooked: The Anthropology of Eating

      
      
       Students will learn about the evolution and significance of food production, especially in relation to globalisation, identity and health.  The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development.  it will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation.  Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings.  We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporarary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

      SE580 - Primate Behaviour and Ecology

      
      
       This module introduces students to the discipline of behavioural ecology, with particular reference to non-human primates. The module looks at the patterns and principles that can be generalised from the variation in behaviour and ecology across primate species. Set within an evolutionary behavioural-ecological framework, this module combines established findings with the latest research. It emphasises the importance of direct observations of primate behaviour and the use of theoretical models with which to make sense of these data. The module covers social and reproductive behaviour within primate groups, the nature and evolution of primate societies, and cognition and communication, as well as interactions between primates and their environments: primates as foragers, predators and prey. The module will make particular use of multi-media technology to allow students to see and hear primates in their natural habitats.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

      SE554 - Visual Anthropology Theory

      
      
       This module is a general introduction to visual anthropology. It includes treatment of cross-cultural cognition and symbolic analysis, the social history of still photography and film relating to ethnographic subjects, the study of national and regional cinematic traditions (outside Europe and America), the comparative ethnography of television and broader consideration of issues of social representation and political ideology in visual imagery, combining empirical ethnographic analysis of these issues with the alternative (complementary) contributions of scholars of visual imagery from a literary and humanistic tradition of interpretation. It includes a short practical introduction to different visual media, but extended practical experience is available only through the project modules.

      SE593 - Evolution of Human Diversity

      
      
       The nature and extent of the biological diversity observed amongst human populations has been at the heart of anthropological enquiry for centuries. This module will provide an introduction into human phenotypic and genetic diversity across the globe.  Biological anthropologists today use a variety of analytical models and techniques drawn from population and quantitative genetics in order to analyse human biological diversity in a meaningful way. Students will be introduced to these such that the complexities of evolutionary ecological theory are readily understood. Students will learn the extent to which humans have adapted to various environmental conditions as well as understanding the effects of recent demographic changes and population expansions. Students will also learn how human adaptations affect ecological patterns in the species that interact with human populations. This facilitates a direct comparison with other ecological patterns while placing human diversity in broad comparative perspective. This also serves as a platform for critically evaluating claims of human ecological or evolutionary uniqueness.

      SE592 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies

      
      
       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

      SE601 - European Societies

      
      
       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

      SE549 - The Anthropology of Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

      SE547 - South East Asian Societies

      
      
       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      DI510 - Global Biodiversity

      
      
       The aim of this module is to explore the evolutionary, ecological and biological concepts underlying biodiversity. Patterns of species richness, endemism and extinction risk will be examined at different spatial scales using recently available global datasets for mammals, birds and amphibians. We will consider the abiotic and biotic processes that explain these patterns including: - climatic, latitudinal and altitudinal gradients; topography; productivity; habitat heterogeneity and human population density. The main anthropogenic threats to biodiversity will also be examined including habitat loss, fragmentation, over-exploitation and invasive species. Finally, predictive models of future biodiversity loss will be appraised.

      DI518 - Contemporary Conservation Science

      
      
       Conservationists must continually analyse relevant and topical issues in a broad, real-world context. This includes understanding contemporary research, critically evaluating its ecological, evolutionary and interdisciplinary basis, and using this information to inform effective solutions to conservation problems that are embedded in social, political and economic reality. In this module, students will use and apply knowledge/skills gained throughout their degree programme during in-depth discussions of how current research programmes, as presented at the weekly DICE seminars, fit into the wider conservation context. In addition, they will write up these evaluations as a series of News and Views style commentary articles, as published in the top international journal Nature.

      DI532 - Creative Conservation

      
      
       Creative Conservation will engage students with a range of ways of thinking critically about conservation issues and their communication whilst developing their own creative practice and skills portfolio. The approach will seek to take a truly interdisciplinary approach, exploring these issues form a range of disciplinary perspectives and seeking syntheses and new imaginings in addressing them. Topics of focus will be chosen from amongst: History of place and the relationship with nature  esp. East Kent and the Blean Photography - and the use of the still image Video - as representation and a research tool Art and Conservation - craftwork, eco-regional design and natural resource utilisation The Wildlife Documentary - a critical deconstruction and analysis Conservation, Religion and Culture Campaigning for Conservation Conservation and Agriculture Literature and Storytelling Conservation and Cuisine - benefit or burden to the conservation mission? Performance Ethnography - a theoretical framework for action research in conservationIn each case the theoretical, as well as the applied practical aspects of the topic will form a core component of the learning and teaching.
