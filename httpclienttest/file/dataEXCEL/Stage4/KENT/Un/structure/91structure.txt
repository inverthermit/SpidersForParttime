This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PL302 - Introduction to Philosophy: Knowledge and Metaphysics

      
      
       Can I know that I am not dreaming? Am I the same person I was when I was ten years old? Do I have an immaterial mind or immortal soul? Am I a mere machine or do I have a free will? What are the fundamental properties of the world? Does God exist? This module is meant to be an introduction to these and other fundamental problems of philosophy. The module begins with an examination of some themes in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, and moves on to discuss the arguments of other classical philosophers, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and also of contemporary thinkers. Among the themes addressed are: the nature of knowledge, scepticism, personal identity, the mind-body problem, free will and determinism, primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, God. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL303 - Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics

      
      
       Students studying on this module will be introduced to a number of big questions in ethics. The questions may include the following: What makes a life good? Is it happiness? Or is it something else? Another big question is: What makes actions right or wrong? Is it God demanding or forbidding them? Or are actions perhaps right to the extent that they serve to make lives better off, and wrong to the extent that they make lives worse off? Some philosophers have thought so. Others wonder: What if I steal money from someone so rich that my act in no way makes her life go any worse. Might it still be the case that I have acted wronglyeven if I haven't made anyone worse off? A third bit question is this: Whats the status of morality? Is it, for example, the case that whats right for me might be wrong for you? Does it make any sense at all to talk about moral claims being true or false, even relative to moral communities? Might moral judgments be nothing but expressions of sentiments? Throughout the course, students will be examining these and similar questions from the point of view of a variety of philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL310 - Introduction to Philosopy: Logic and Reasoning

      
      
       Since Platos Dialogues, it has been part of philosophical enquiry to consider philosophical questions using logic and common sense alone.  This module aims to train students to continue in that tradition.  In the first part students will be introduced to basic themes in introductory logic and critical thinking.  In the second part students will be presented with a problem each week in the form of a short argument, question, or philosophical puzzle and will be asked to think about it without consulting the literature.  The problem, and students responses to it, will then form the basis of a structured discussion.  By the end of the module, students (a) will have acquired a basic logical vocabulary and techniques for the evaluation of arguments; (b) will have practised applying these techniques to selected philosophical topics; and (c) will have acquired the ability to look at new claims or problems and to apply their newly acquired argumentative and critical skills in order to generate philosophical discussions of them.It will be taught through a combination of lectures and seminars in the first half of the term, and seminars only in the second half of the term.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL315 - Philosophical Reading and Writing (core)

      
      
       What do philosophers do?  How do they think?  What do they typically think about?  How do philosophers write?  What sorts of writing are acceptable in philosophy?  How should you write?  How should philosophy best be read in order to be understood and assessed? In this module we will introduce you to some of the most interesting questions in philosophy, both from its history and from current debates.  As we do this we will show you how to think, read and write as a philosopher.   Some of the questions we will discuss this year include: Why is Humes fork so important in the history of philosophy?, What is the difference between evaluative and descriptive judgements in aesthetics? and What is the difference between is and ought?  We will also think about questions of more general philosophical import, such as: What it is to presuppose something?, What is it to argue in a vicious circle?, and What does a philosophical definition look like?

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CL329 - Introduction to Archaeology

      
      
       The module will introduce archaeology as an academic discipline, providing grounding in basic concepts and methodology and techniques of analysis relating to archaeological evidence. It will provide background relevant to other archaeological and historical modules through examining aspects of the archaeological process in prehistoric, Roman and medieval contexts. It will enable students to make an informed choice of subsequent modules. Topics will include basic fieldwork methods and techniques, and an introduction to key topics in interpretation, such as society and culture, ritual and religion, technology, etc. through case studies e.g . of Pompeii, Sutton Hoo, and the Ice Man.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CL353 - The Civilisations of Greece and Rome

      
      
       In the Autumn term we start with Greece. The history will centre on Athens in the 5th century B.C. We begin with Solons reforms, then after considering the period of the Persian invasions we study the developed democracy with its empire under Pericles and its destruction in the Peloponnesian War. After 5 weeks, we move to the literature of the period, more specifically, the development of tragedy and comedy in fifth-century Athens, examining staging and dramatic conventions such as the role of actor, chorus and religious function and plot, especially the handling of mythological themes. We will analyse a selection of major plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Within this framework the module explores the role of tragedy and comedy as vehicles for public debate in the democracy, and its treatment of justice, religion, rationalism and patriotic themes.In the Spring term, we move to Rome. In the Roman part of the course we shall treat the last century of the republic. Our focus will be on how that republic fell and was replaced by the empire whose founder was Augustus. Among the themes examined will be political violence, the intrusion of the army into political life and the rise of the warlord. In the literature part of the Spring term the module is concerned with the patronage of the arts (poetry, history writing, art and architecture) under Augustus, with the role of the arts as propaganda, and the thesis that writers were recruited to act as spokesmen for the policies and ideals of the principate. The central theme is the creation of enduring images of Rome and Empire, using traditional historical and mythological materials; alongside this the module treats areas of public policy such as moral legislation, festivals, religious reform and the position of women.  The module is also concerned with the responses of the writers, whether as supporters of public policy, or as commenting on and reacting against it. Thus, its content is much better understood as a result of the historical development outlined in the first part of term.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      CL604 - Roman and Medieval Artefacts

      
      
       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL659 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world? This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

      CL663 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences. Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject. Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness. In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject. An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus. The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine. From here, the study will move into the Roman period. Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry. For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen. Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another. Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.

      CL665 - Constantinople and the Late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL666 - Foundations of Britain

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL677 - Fieldwork Practice

      
      
       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL652 - Gods, Heroes and Mystery Cults: Religion in  Ancient Greece

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL685 - Torture and Sacrifice: the literature of early Christianity

      
      
       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity.  A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

      CL692 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

      CL700 - Museum Studies (with internship)

      
      
       The module will allow the student to acquire knowledge and critical understanding of the fundamental principles related to collecting and interpreting objects within museums and managing these institutions. .Students will be required to become familiar and engage critically, during the seminars, with the key references on these topics. Students will then be required to apply concepts and principles learnt in class in the context of their internship.. As part of their internship, each student will devise a special project in consultation with the mentor and the module convenor. Precise objectives and skills to be learnt will be recorded and tracked regularly. Students will keep a weekly log of their activities. The placement may take place either as a block during the Easter vacation of Stage 2 or 3, or at regular intervals over the Autumn and Spring terms.

      CL310 - Greek for Beginners

      
      
       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

       This module examines, in detail, Greek history from the end of the Persian invasions to the fall of Athens in 404 BC. The main themes of the module are the rise and fall of the power of Athens, the Peloponnesian War and the role of the Persian Empire in Greek history in the 5th century BC. Particular attention will be paid to the causes of the conflict between Athens and Sparta and to the political and military history of the last three decades of the 5th century BC.

      CL708 - Greek Philosophy: Plato and Aristotle

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to some of the major works in ancient Greek philosophy in relation to ethics, aesthetics, political theory, ontology and metaphysics. Students will study substantial portions of primary texts by the Pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle. The emphasis throughout will be on the philosophical significance of the ideas studied. The module will concentrate on understanding key philosophical arguments and concepts within the context of the ancient Greek intellectual tradition. This means that students will gain a critical distance from normative and modern definitions of philosophical terms in order to understand how Greek philosophy generally approached questions and problems with different suppositions and conceptions of reality, reason and the purpose of human existence.

      CL713 - Athenian Power Plays

      
      
       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      PL640 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL642 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL628 - Continental Philosophy: Subject, Identity and the Political

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to introduce students to some of the key arguments and debates in contemporary continental political philosophy through the focussed reading and discussion of the works of a number of central thinkers (Charles Taylor, Iris Marion Young, Foucualt, Derrida, Butler) in this field. It is also the aim of this module to consider the works and ideas of philosophers that are often overlooked on undergraduate political philosophy courses e.g. feminist thinkers and Queer theorists.The curriculum should not be regarded as written in stone but responsive to new publications and developments in this field of research and to events in the wider world.

      PL638 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations.   They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology.  Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel.  However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes.  In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist.  An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students.  However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand.  This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight.    The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers.  Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full.  These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

       Is it right that the talented profit from their (undeserved) talents? Should the government provide compensation for people who find it hard to meet that special someone? Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses.

      PL584 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL585 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL596 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL602 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval.The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

       What is art?  What is an artwork?  Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common?  If so, what are they?  Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided?  Do avant-garde works count as art?  Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention?  What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally?  These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course.  After that we will consider other issues and questions.  What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities?  What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way?  Why is rock music such a part of our lives?  Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery?  What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art?  Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters?  Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code?  And what on earth is the point of public art?  What is public art?

      PL625 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      CL310 - Greek for Beginners

      
      
       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

       The module will allow the student to acquire knowledge and critical understanding of the fundamental principles related to collecting and interpreting objects within museums and managing these institutions. .Students will be required to become familiar and engage critically, during the seminars, with the key references on these topics.  Students will then be required to apply concepts and principles learnt in class in the context of their internship.. As part of their internship, each student will devise a special project in consultation with the mentor and the module convenor. Precise objectives and skills to be learnt will be recorded and tracked regularly. Students will keep a weekly log of their activities. The placement may take place either as a block during the Easter vacation of Stage 2 or 3, or at regular intervals over the Autumn and Spring terms.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CL686 - Torture and Sacrifice: the literature of early Christianity

      
      
       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity. A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

      CL691 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

      CL590 - The Foundations of Britain: Archaeology of the first Millenium B.C.

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL591 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world?  This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL607 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences.  Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject.  Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness.  In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject.  An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus.  The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine.  From here, the study will move into the Roman period.  Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry.  For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen.  Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another.  Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL639 - Constantinople and the late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       This module is intended to introduce undergraduate students to research. As such it provides an opportunity to work on a topic of their own choosing, in either archaeology, history or ancient literature. Originality and feasibility are important aspects of writing dissertations, and to avoid problems topics will be scrutinised and approved by CLAS before research can begin. Students can expect guidance from the module convenor and an academic supervisor throughout the process, varying from one-to-one tutorials to classes on how to edit your own prose. There will also be a meeting regarding the Dissertation at the end of the Spring term of the previous year to clarify arrangements and to outline what work is required on this module.The programme document with regulations is sent to all students at the end of spring term of Stage 2. Students are invited to suggest titles for comment, for which tutors are allocated. They are advised to do preliminary reading over the summer based on generic advice of the module convenor. They then choose precise topics in consultation with the convenor and personal tutors at the start of the autumn term. This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses

Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

      PL639 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations. They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel. However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes. In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist. An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students. However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand. This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight. The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers. Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full. These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

      PL514 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

       What is art? What is an artwork? Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common? If so, what are they? Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided? Do avant-garde works count as art? Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention? What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally? These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course. After that we will consider other issues and questions. What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities? What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way? Why is rock music such a part of our lives? Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery? What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art? Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters? Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code? And what on earth is the point of public art? What is public art?

      PL527 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL643 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      TH619 - Religious Studies and Philosophy in the Classroom

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. This module is aimed at those students who would like to follow a career as Secondary School teachers, but is also suitable to those who would like to combine an academic course with work experience. Placements in a school environment will enhance the students employment opportunities as they will acquire a range of skills. It will also provide the students with the opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of Religious Education and Philosophy in the secondary school context. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other. The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school where each student will have a designated teacher-mentor who will guide their work in school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progress, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL570 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      PL576 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      PL641 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL623 - Advanced Topics in Reasoning

      
      
       The module will cover some of the major topics of the theory of reasoning, with a focus on presenting students with new and exciting research. The syllabus will vary from year to year. The approach will be philosophical and critical, and may involve the close reading of texts. Students will be expected to engage critically with the works being studied and to formulate and argue for their own views on the issues covered. As an indication of the kind of topics covered, the following are three potential syllabi, one of which might operate in any particular year:1. Probability and probabilistic reasoning. This syllabus will present the major interpretations of probability and their connection with the various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. Topics covered might include: the classical interpretation; the logical interpretation; the subjective interpretation; the frequency interpretation; the propensity interpretation; the objective Bayesian interpretation. The key text will be D.A.Gillies (2000): Philosophical theories of probability, Routledge.2. Causality and causal reasoning. This syllabus will present the major theories of causality, including difference-making theories (probabilistic theories, counterfactual theories, agency theories), mechanistic theories (process theories, complex systems theories) and pluralist theories. It will go on to consider methods of causal reasoning in the sciences and the implications of such methods for the metaphysics of causality. In the absence of a comprehensive text, this syllabus will appeal to papers, especially those in the Oxford Handbook of Causation (OUP 2009), and Causality in the Sciences (OUP 2011).3. Invalid arguments. This syllabus will look in detail at methods of assessing the cogency of deductively invalid arguments. In particular it will present the methods of inductive logic for assessing the plausibility of arguments. It will provide an introduction to probabilistic logics and their semantics, as well as to methods of inference in probabilistic logics, with a focus on elementary methods that can be readily acquired by students with little prior training in logic and no prior knowledge of probability theory. In the absence of a text at a suitable level, this syllabus will be accompanied by a set of detailed lecture notes.Convenor: Jon WilliamsonJon Williamson works on various topics connected with reasoning, inference and scientific method, including causal reasoning in the sciences, inductive reasoning, and the nature of probability. The aim of this module is to introduce students to cutting-edge research on topics such as these. Jon is editor of the gazette The Reasoner, co-director of the Centre for Reasoning, and author of books on reasoning such as Bayesian nets and causality (OUP 2005), In defence of objective Bayesianism (OUP 2010) and Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks (Springer 2011).

      PL624 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.
