      SP301 - Introduction to Biological and General Psychology

      
      
       Psychology is an increasingly popular discipline, possibly because of its relevance to the problems of everyday life. It is also a scientific discipline and draws on other areas of scientific investigation for its concepts and ideas, including Biology, Linguistics, Computer Science and Philosophy. The general aim of this module is to introduce students to the scientific study of behaviour, covering the basic approaches to the subject, including the Biological approach, the Cognitive approach, Behaviourism and Ethology, the Development perspective and related philosophical ideas. Rather than teach these topics in separate blocks, the module is organised so as to emphasise how the theoretical frameworks underlying these approaches relate and contrast. The module also shows how psychological theories and ideas can be used to account for both everyday and abnormal human behaviour.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SP302 - Introduction to Social Psychology

      
      
       This module, along with other Stage 1 psychology modules, provides a foundation for Stages 2 and 3. It will provide students with an introduction to the methods, techniques and issues involved in the study of social psychology. The emphasis of the module is on theory as the foundation of an empirical discipline and the importance of scientific methodology. It highlights the interplay between theory, research, and application in social psychology. Focus is placed on core theories and research in social psychology, developmental psychology, personality psychology, and applied psychology. The module is taught through lectures and skills workshops.

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SP500 - Psychology Statistics and Practical

      
      
       The broad aims of the module are: (a) to provide a continued training in methodological skills appropriate to psychological investigation; (b) to provide advanced training in statistical techniques of the analysis of psychological data; (c) to provide training in computing skills for conducting analysis of psychological data; and (d) to provide direct experience of some of the phenomena encountered in other Stage 2/3 psychology modules.  The practical component of the module consists of a structured programme of laboratory classes and non-laboratory sessions during which students work in small supervised groups designing and carrying out four research projects related to themes encountered in the departments other Stage 2/3 modules.  A programme of statistics lectures and computing workshops is closely linked to the practical classes.  Computerbased statistical analysis is illustrated using SPSS, a general-purpose statistical package.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SP528 - Child Development

      
      
       The focus of this module is on understanding how children develop, with particular emphasis on the historical background of this part of the discipline, and the key theories, explanations and research conducted within developmental psychology.  Certainly, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that for all of us, the period of our lives we go through described as childhood has a significant influence on who we become as adults. Understanding something of the processes we all appear to go through is a central part of any psychology degree, and by the end of this module you should be in a much better position to understand the significance of child development for human psychology.  As the course progresses we will move from issues germane to early infancy, then through early childhood and the associated social, cognitive and emotional changes the child experiences during that period, and then a detailed look at adolescence.  An additional major component of the course examines how children acquire language and learn how to talk - possibly the most significant development of all.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

       The personality module examines different perspectives on the study of personality from Allport to the present day. The aim is to provide the student with a comparative and critical review of the major theories in personality and the research and findings that stem from them. Teaching will be by lectures and seminars.

      SP604 - Biological Psychology

      
      
       This module focuses on the study of the biological bases of human behaviour, relating actions and experiences to genetics and physiology.  It will cover topic areas including drug addiction, sleep, emotion, language, memory, and schizophrenia.  The module will also discuss biological research methods such as brain imaging techniques (for example PET, fMRI, EEG), physiological recording, and the study of brain-damaged patients. The aim of the module is to enable students to reach a sufficient level of understanding of biological psychology to be capable of critically evaluating theory and method in published research.

      SP619 - The Social Psychology of Groups

      
      
       This module introduces you to the major orientations and discoveries in the social psychology of group processes.  The material covers both behaviour within groups (e.g. group structure, social influence, leadership, and group performance) and behaviour between groups (e.g. intergroup conflict and cooperation, social categorisation and social identity, prejudice and its reduction). Basic mechanisms in groups that occupy the same position in the social structure in terms of power, status, and group size, as well as mechanisms that characterize asymmetric groups will be analyzed. There is a strong emphasis on social psychological theory being examined by systematic empirical research.  Teaching will be by lectures and seminars with additional practical demonstrations from time to time.

       This module will build upon the cognitive theories and research methods explored in those modules taught at Stages 1 and 2. The central theme of the module will be to focus on distinct neuropsychological deficits acquired through stroke, such as hemi-spatial neglect, prosopagnosia, aphasia and amnesia. The idea will be to give students a grounding in how different strands of neuroscientific research - behavioural, cognitive, structural, physiological - have both advanced our understanding of neuropsychological disorders and informed on the design of relevant intervention strategies.

      SP612 - Attitudes and Social Cognition

      
      
       This module is concerned with contemporary concepts, theories and findings in this broad area of social psychology and how they may be applied with benefits for individuals, groups and society. We will address the question how individuals form and maintain an understanding of themselves, other people, and the world they are living in. Drawing on cognitive principles, we will study the processes that underlie human judgments, behaviour, and decision making in real-life contexts. Students will have the opportunity to propose new research to address an unanswered research question, and apply their knowledge to represent scientific psychology more fully and accurately to the wider public.

       This course will introduce students to a wide range of areas in the field of the psychology of music, including psychoacoustics and auditory perception, the development of musicality, the cognitive neuroscience of music and the relationship between music and emotion. The primary aim will be to describe and explain the different theoretical approaches and research methodologies employed in the psychology of music. Consideration of the ways in which we perform, listen to, engage with and learn about music allows us to address key issues in the areas of language processing, brain function, creativity, problem solving and memory. In addition the course will example contexts where the psychology of music has practical applications, for example in health psychology and in the media.
