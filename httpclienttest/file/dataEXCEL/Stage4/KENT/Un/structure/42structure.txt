 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      FI313 - Film Style

      
      
       This course will change the way in which you watch films and will make going to the movies even more exciting than it has ever been before. You are going to be introduced to the language of film, from aspects of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne to framing, sound and editing. The study of these elements will enable you to understand film narrative, as well as the stylistic, expressive and dramatic functions of specific strategies. The course investigates a number of diverse film genres, including science fiction, horror, and western, as well as animation and documentary films, and explores a variety of national and historical contexts. It also aims at establishing connections between film, performance and other arts, including painting and photography.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI315 - Introduction to Film Theory

      
      
       This module approaches the big questions that have surrounded film and the moving image and puts them into historical context. Although specific topics will vary, representative topics may address competing definitions of film and its constitutive elements, the effects that cinema has on spectators, the social, cultural and political implications that moving images reproduce, and the status of the medium between art and entertainment. Students will debate seminal writings on the nature of film and bring their arguments to bear on exemplary film productions.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA315 - Introduction to Contemporary Art

      
      
       This course aims to draw on both the history and theory of art in order to present a wide range of contemporary forms of art and artistic practice, and to articulate some key distinctions useful for addressing the question of the place of art in culture.  In particular, a discussion of ideas of the avant-garde, of modernity and postmodernism will be relevant here.  The course will explore, through pursuing general themes and case studies of particularly controversial art objects, the different means by which our notions of art and of the artist are 'framed' today, and it will therefore both inform students' broader study of the history of art and complement their individual artistic practice. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA355 - Introduction to the History of Art

      
      
       The module is intended as an introduction to the History of Art, as a body of visual artefacts and as an academic discipline.  It is intended to be accessible to those with little or no previous experience, but also stimulating and informative to students with more background knowledge. The approach is chronological, focussing on a sequence of canonical works of art produced within the Western tradition.  Such works provide a frame for introducing students to many of the basic analytical concepts and terms routinely deployed by art historians in describing, analysing and interpreting works of art: period, style, iconography, meaning, material/medium, technique, composition, creative process, representation, tradition, social function, patronage, genre etc.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI537 - Postwar European Cinema

      
      
       This course investigates some major aesthetic, political, and theoretical trends of postwar European cinema. Students are introduced to a selection of European films as well as to the writings of key Continental filmmakers, theorists and critics. Students will examine the new waves from France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, and the neo-realism originating in Italy, as well as movements such as Dogme '95. The module also looks at the impact of popular European genre cinema, including analysis of the horror movie and the Spaghetti Western. In addition, the module will also have a contemporary scope, with a study of more recent developments in European film. The films will be examined for their claims to interpret the real world, their relationship to films in other national contexts, and also be interrogated for the economic and artistic motivations behind their existence as critical categories.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI565 - British Cinema

      
      
       In a country with a very strong literary and theatrical tradition, the British have also had a long-standing love of "going to the pictures."  For more than a century, British filmmakers have been forging a rich and diverse national cinema in the face of Hollywoods dominance on British screens for most of that time.  This course will offer an introductory historical overview of British cinema from its beginnings to the present day, assessing its role in the construction of British national identity, evaluating its major directorsincluding Humphrey Jennings, Ken Loach and Sally Potter. The films will be approached through multiple frameworks, including consideration of aesthetics (e.g. realism), culture (e.g. gender and class), and history (e.g. the legacy of colonialism).  The institution of cinema and film culture in a larger sense will be considered through the exploration of British film exhibition, criticism, cultural policy, and industry.  Both fiction films and documentaries will be discussed.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI602 - Documentary Cinema

      
      
       This module addresses a series of documentary films in their historical context and in relation to the different modes of non-fiction filmmaking. Documentary narrative techniques including the use of archival footage, staged reconstructions of past events, and talking-head interviews, are investigated by means of close textual analysis and through a comparative approach to diverse documentary films. This module also explores the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction and, while articulating a definition of documentary film, it studies film forms that present an interplay between the two, such as Mockumentaries and Essay Films.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI603 - Sound and Cinema

      
      
       Cinema has typically been conceived of as an essentially visual phenomenon  films, it is often said, are essentially moving pictures. Sound has, nevertheless, played an important role from the beginnings of cinema, a fact which has been acknowledged in the detailed historical, theoretical and critical work on film music, and film sound more generally, produced over the last decade. Sound and Cinema will provide an overview of this new field of research, and aim to provide students with a clearer understanding of and greater sensitivity to the soundtrack. The course will begin by setting up an introductory framework for the understanding of sound, which considers the relationship between music and other aspects of film sound (dialogue, voice-over, effects), as well as the nature of the relationship between image and sound. Subsequent sessions will consider the evolution of sound technology and its impact on the aural aesthetics of film; the use of classical and popular music in film scores; the emergence of sound designers, such as Walter Murch and Alan Splet, in contemporary cinema; and the distinctive and innovative use of sound and music by such diverse directors as Wim Wenders, Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch, and William Raban.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI604 - Digital Domains

      
      
       The module primarily focuses on contemporary digital filmmaking practices and film viewing. The first section of the module introduces trick cinema, special effects, the digital intermediate, and a range of computer generated images to explore the different opportunities these offer for manipulating space, constructing narratives and aesthetic innovation. The second section of the module more explicitly engages with a range of theoretical frameworks in order to think about how digital technologies alter our understanding of film, its relationships with other media, and the ways in which we participate in film culture.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI607 - Storytelling and the Cinema

      
      
       This module examines different forms of narrative and story-telling in cinema, drawing upon theories of myth, folk and fairytale as well as upon anthropological studies of oral storytelling in order to place film narration within the tradition of the popular arts. The psychological and aesthetic role of narrative will be explored through the accounts offered by philosophy and psychoanalysis in order to understand the relations and tensions between narrative realism based on Aristotelian notions of cause and effect as well as character verisimilitude, and popular and avant-garde modes which transgress such notions.  The role played by, for example, film genres and the star system in disrupting or supporting narrative cause and effect will be considered.   The function of the script and of script-writing will be looked at in relation to the deployment of the cinematic elements of sound and image, spectacle and event in film.  The course will be taught through a series of case-studies using a wide range of films within American and world cinema.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI611 - New York & The Movies

      
      
       This module examines the way New York has been used as a site for filmmaking, looking at the history of the production of films in and about the city, and as a vital centre of film culture -- not just of filmmaking, but also exhibition and film criticism. Beginning with an examination of film, and modernity, with a specific focus on late silent/early sound film production, the module then shifts to look at avant-garde practice in New York during the 1950s and 60s, and concludes by considering the citys representation in mainstream Hollywood productions with a particular focus on generic crime movies and/or romantic comedies.  The work on New York and film will be contextualised within a cultural history of the city, with a dual emphasis on narratives of immigration and the city as the postwar centre of the world art market.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI594 - Film Authorship

      
      
       This module will offer students the rare opportunity to examine in detail the work of a single director or a group of directors. It will thus enable students to acquire a more complex understanding of the issues at stake in the production, distribution, and reception of a specific body of film work. The module will also develop students knowledge and understanding of the questions, theories and controversies, which have informed critical issues and theoretical debates on film authorship. It will thus appeal to students who wish to extend their skills in analysing film form, meaning, and practice in both a conceptual and a historical context. Furthermore, as the module will enable detailed consideration of what film directing is, as an artistic and cultural practice, in given contexts, it will be a very useful course to combine with the practical study of filmmaking.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI595 - Film Genre (Horror)

      
      
       This module studies individual genres, which may vary across different academic terms (it may focus on the horror, science-fiction, western, musical, comedy, the noir or the gangster film, among others). It combines aesthetic and narrative analysis with the history of the genre. The theoretical framework draws from Marxist, psychoanalytical, feminist, and reception theories. The historical portion of the course examines the genres growing commercial viability, the proliferation of subgenres, and the growing attention of academics. Topics include gender politics, representations of sexuality, and political commentary and allegory. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI597 - Animated Worlds

      
      
       Animation is a term covering a diverse range of forms, and this module introduces cel- animation, stop-motion puppetry, abstract animation, as well as computer-generated cartoons and features (including animated documentaries) to explore the animated form. The first section of the module introduces different styles of through a study of Disney and Warner Bros cartoons, the stop-motion animations of the Quay Bros, TV Anime, abstract music animation and web-based animation. The second section of the module uses a range of critical approaches to explore contemporary feature length animations from different national contexts.

      FI599 - The Gothic in Film

      
      
       This module will investigate the Gothic as a significant and recurring cycle within Hollywood film with recognisable tropes and themes, and a dominant tone and style. Beginning with the cycle of Womens Gothic which emerged at the same time as Film Noir, and visually and thematically overlapped with it, the module will explore the particularly filmic ways that such texts manage to evoke the menacing atmosphere and the tone of sexualised danger and suspense achieved by the Gothics source novels and short stories. Continuing from the original cycle of 1940s films, the module will examine later Hollywood films that have employed the themes and imagery of the Gothic to tap into similar complex anxieties and desires, before inspecting films from other cinemas (for example, those of Europe and Asia) which also make use of the dominant Gothic tropes.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI600 - Film Criticism

      
      
       This course introduces students to the history and theory of film criticism, emphasising the coexistence of different approaches to the analysis, evaluation and appreciation of film. The module will also have a practical aspect, offering students the opportunity to write critical pieces on the films screened for the class. In addition to traditional lectures and seminars, some sessions will be devoted to writing and to analysing fellow students' work. Participants will also be encouraged to reflect critically on different media of film criticism (newspapers, magazines, academic journals, the internet, television) and on the current state of film criticism.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI601 - Extreme Cinema

      
      
       This course probes issues of extreme cinema, i.e., arthouse films which, because of violent, sexual, or other iconoclastic content, form or style, have created critical or popular controversy. Representative topics include the aesthetics of violence and the ethics of representing and viewing pain, boundaries between erotic art and exploitation, disgust and the unwatchable, authorial performance and resistant spectatorship, reception studies and censorship.

      FI618 - Screenwriting: An Introduction

      
      
       This module offers students an introduction to the terms, ideas and craft, involved in the creation of screenplays. Screenwriting is a unique form of writing with very different concerns from the novel, theatre and radio. Although the screenplay is a vital component of a films success, it tends to be neglected as a separate art form.In this module we explore the conventions of dramatic structure, new narrative forms and short film variations. Students are encouraged to think critically about screenplay writing and will have an opportunity to write their own screenplay. A selection of writing exercises have been designed to take them through the writing process; from preparation and initial concept to final draft.The emphasis here will be on practical knowledge and support as students uncover their creative voice. This module does not aim to provide vocational training for students wishing to pursue careers in the feature film or television industries.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI622 - Television Series: Narration, Engagement and Evaluation

      
      
       The module explores storytelling in fictional television series, and how the long duration of these series changes the spectators engagement, as compared to engagement in the relatively short fiction film. Furthermore, this module focuses on case studies in order to investigate their narrative, stylistic and thematic characteristics, their specific genre conventions and their background in television history. Case studies may include The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Madmen in an inquiry into the narrative as well as moral complexity of this recent, so-called quality trend of American drama television series, and the emerging genre convention of the antihero. The module also addresses how various types of television series have been valued in critical reception through the history of television. For example, in relation to the case studies mentioned above, the module may examine critically the implications of the oft-used label Quality TV and the HBO slogan Its not TV, its HBO. In addition to introducing the students to current developments in television studies, this module takes a film theoretical, narratological approach to current television series, and trains students in various approaches to the study of television series in and beyond television studies proper. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      FI623 - Beyond Cinema

      
      
       From the intimate viewing experience offered by mobile phones to the social interaction required by sing-a-long screenings, this module considers the changing nature of where, when and how audiences engage with film and the moving image. It considers the history of cinema-going, paying attention to the old and new sites of exhibition, especially those facilitated by new technologies. Connectedly, the module analyses the different modes of spectatorship, including audience participation and the desire to prolong or enhance the cinematic experience via extra-filmic activities, such as film-tourism. It also considers films interaction with other arts and mediafor example, its use within theatrical performances and its relationship with television. In doing so, this module reflects upon and reconsiders the definitions and limits of cinema and addresses the implications this has for the academic discipline Film Studies.

      HA671 - Beauty in Theory, Culture and Contemporary Art

      
      
       After decades of neglect, beauty has made a controversial return both in contemporary art and as a concept in contemporary aesthetics, art theory and criticism.  The module examines the issues raised by this recent resurgence of beauty. Looking at the concept of beauty, the role of beauty in culture and society, and its presence in contemporary art and theory, the module explores the issues that make the return of beauty such a controversial topic.  The module will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines to examine the place of beauty: classic philosophical texts (Plato, Kant, Lessing), contemporary philosophy (Levinson, Gaut, Nehamas, Walton, Zangwill, Hepburn), cognitive and evolutionary science (McMahon, Etcoff), art criticism (Danto, Hickey, Beckley), art history (Gombrich, Clark), sociology and cultural theory (Wolff). In addition, a range of traditional, modern and contemporary artists will be discussed, including Goya, Warhol, Orlan, Duchamp, Picasso, Goldsworthy, Rubens, Ofili, Poussin, Serrano, Metsys, Velazquez, Motherwell, Rembrandt, Mangold.

      HA676 - Transatlantic Dialogues: British and Modern Art c.1900-1970

      
      
       The development of British and American art reveals patterns of affinity, divergence and mutual interplay, against a backdrop of the wider of an international Modernism centred to a large degree on Paris. This module examines such themes as the following: the currency and influence of realist, abstract, and surrealist aesthetics in the first decades of the 20th century(focussing on figures such as Walter Sickert, Edward Hopper, Ben Nicholson, Stuart Davis, Henry Moore); the impact of the Second World War (and of Picassos Guernica as an exemplary artistic response to conditions of war); the emergence after the war of painterly abstraction (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Peter Lanyon), alongside new approaches to expressive figuration (Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon); the development of constructed sculpture (David Smith, Anthony Caro) and post-painterly abstraction (Frank Stella, Bridget Riley) on either side of 1960; parallel manifestations of Pop, Minimalist, Conceptual and Land Art (Richard Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Richard Long, Robert Smithson); attitudes to photography as an artistic and documentary medium (Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus).

      HA679 - From Warhol to Whiteread: Postmodernity & Visual Art Practice

      
      
       This module explores a range of neo-avant-garde and post-war art practice from the 1960s through to the contemporary; from the Minimalism & Pop Art of the 1960s through to the YBAs and after. It will introduce and discuss some of the key artistic figures within the period, exploring their practice, critical contexts and legacy. Taking a thematic approach to one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse art historical periods, we will consider a range of genres  painting, sculpture, installation, performance and land art  exploring how artists have re-defined and developed their practice in the cultural period following Modernism. Artists exampled will typically include Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gilbert & George, Eva Hesse, Jenny Saville, Yinka Shonibare, Gerhard Richter and Rachel Whiteread.

      HA680 - Classicism and Baroque

      
      
       The organising principle of this course is derived from Giovanni Pietro Belloris Vite de Pittori et Architetti Moderni (1672). In selecting a small group of twelve exemplary artists for his history, Bellori was employing artistic biography to expound his theory of art based on the Idea. This charted a middle way between naturalism and mannerism, through which the imitation of nature informed by the principles of antique art produced works which surpassed nature. Among the artists included in Belloris corpus are Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Michelangelo da Caravaggio, and the non-Italian artists Nicolas Poussin, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. Several of the leading artists of the period were excluded from the canon, notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Bellori presumably had these artists in mind when he condemned his contemporaries who juggle madly with corners, gaps and twirling lines, discompose bases, capitals and columns with stucco nonsense, trivial ornament and disproportions. The aesthetic and theoretical judgements which informed Belloris exclusion of artists from his book can be glimpsed in this quote. In the art historical literature on this period such critical judgements are explained in terms of the dichotomy between classicism and the baroque (although these were not terms used in the period). Following Riegl and W&ouml;lfflin the baroque has been defined in opposition to classic art, as an art of becoming rather than of being, addressing the emotions, rather than the intellect, through a tactile evocation of appearances. Often the theoretical writing of the period has been characterised as reacting against, or irrelevant to, what was truly innovative about the work of baroque artists like Bernini and Borromini. These generalisations will be tested through close study of the works of the artists named above, and also by exploring how they might relate to contemporary artistic debates, such as those at the French Acad&eacute;mie Royale about the relative merits of Poussin and Rubens, or between Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona in Rome over the number of figures which should be included in a narrative painting. In addition to exploring the acute interest in stylistic criticism during the seventeenth century, the study of individual artists will also involve consideration of the role played by their patrons, especially their ideological, religious and antiquarian concerns. Although the course will progress by studying individual artists in roughly chronological order, the treatment will be thematic rather than monographic. Lectures at the beginning and end of the course will introduce and summarise the more general historiographical themes; the remaining lectures will be on artists including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Bernini, Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, Poussin, Rubens and Van Dyck.

      HA595 - Visual Arts Writing

      
      
        This module will be for final year students who are interested in gaining employment within the art and heritage press and/or marketing sectors. It will complement the vocational and work-based emphasis of the existing HPA Internship module (HA579). It will comprise a series of taught seminars supplemented by visiting speakers from the art/trade press, and from across the marketing and heritage sectors [6-8 speakers per module delivery]. NB: This is not an NCTJ validated course and makes no pretence at providing the full competencies of such. What it will provide will be an introduction to a range of press and related activities within the visual arts and heritage sectors. It will be of relevance for those students considering the possibility of working within these areas and for those who wish to explore some of the practicalities of researching and submitting copy and undertaking related promotional and marketing activities. The module will start by considering examples from the range of trade, specialist and institutionally affiliated publications which service the art and heritage markets. It will consider their target readerships, commissioning practices and particular subject and industry angles. Publications such as The Antiques Trade Gazette, The Art Newspaper, Tate Magazine and Art Monthly will be among those evaluated. Seminars will introduce some of the basic principles of trade writing: standing up and presenting copy proposals for commissioning; adapting copy to differing house-styles; preparing for and undertaking interviews for writing briefs and useful sources of information for generating ideas for prospective writing projects. Seminars will also consider the arts-related promotional work typically undertaken by press and marketing departments within auction houses, public art galleries and within government-funded organisations such as the British Council, and those local and regional authorities with heritage related responsibilities and sections (Canterbury City Council, Medway Unitary Authority etc).

      HA657 - Photographic History & Aesthetics 1: Realism in Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module begins with an exploration of the history and pre-history of the invention of various photographic technologies, along with the early uses to which these technologies were put. Particular attention is given to the early cultural and intellectual impact of the invention of photography, especially its use as a recorder of the appearance. After considering an example of the kind of predominate modernist art theory that made photography problematic as a realist art form, the emergence and development of realist photographic theory in various guises is explored through a number of key authors and seminal texts. Having explored a wide variety of realist theories, the difficulties of reconciling a realist photographic practice with traditional accounts of aesthetic significance is discussed along with possible responses. The module closes by considering the rise of digital imaging and the end of the realist aesthetic among fine art photographers, as well as exploring the implications of this new technology for our understanding of what a photograph is.

      HA661 - Art & Film

      
      
       Art & Film will explore the longstanding relationship between these visual media and the different ways this relationship has been conceived and evolved over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first century. Though special emphasis will be placed on the post second world war period, which has seen artists and filmmakers increasingly exploring intermediality, the course will begin by examining the field of visuality out of which cinema emerged and will look at the shared visual traditions that existed between them within the rapidly changing visual culture of the nineteenth century. The development of cinema and photography will be examined in relation to new technologies for the production of visual knowledge and imagery and the new modes of spectating that accompanied their inception. The influence of traditions of painting on early cinema will be studied in relation to shared codes of gesture, composition and tableaux, but the course will also assess the early influence of cinema on painting. In this context the development of serialism in art in the late 1880s will receive special attention.The course will then look at both early experimental film within the context of modernist and avant garde practice in the first part of the twentieth century and Hollywood filmmakers in the 1920s and 30s, whose films continued to make overt references to Academic and non-Academic traditions of painting. The module will examine the impact of theories of modernism on the evolution of film and art before moving on to consider the way artists and filmmakers have engaged with the issue of intermediality in the post-1945 era.In the context of studying particular artists, filmmakers and movements in the visual arts, students will be engaging with a range of thematic and aesthetic issues that cut across the boundaries of different visual media, exploring questions about perspective, colour and light, movement, montage, temporality, narrative and resistance to narrative, and the transposition of one medium into another, (e.g. the portrayal of painting, photography, drawings, prints and sculpture in film and other media). During the course students will deepen their understanding of the impact of critical theories on art and culture on the production and reception of works of visual art by being introduced to key critical texts. Within this context the course will also look at institutional frameworks and settings (e.g. the museum, the gallery, the cinema etc.) in which works of art and films are produced and viewed, examining how these settings inflect the experience of those works.

      HA663 - Abstraction & Construction in the 20th Century

      
      
       The development of Abstract Art is one of the distinctive features of the 20th Century. This module examines the roots of the aspiration to allow the object to evaporate like smoke in European and Russian art, and the establishment of Constructivism as a central force in artistic practice in 20th century art. The spiritual, philosophical and social ideas (and ideals) of key artists (such as Malevich, Tatlin, Kandinsky, Mondrian and Klee) are considered in relation to their artistic practice; the work and ideas of American abstractionists are addressed through an examination of legendary figures such as Rothko, Pollock and Stella; discussion of Nicholson, Moore, and de Sta&euml;l, among others, enables us to think about the response of the British and European artworld to the challenges and opportunities of abstraction and construction. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists make use of this radical tradition. Throughout the module we will raise the question of how to make, think about and respond to an art without objects.

      HA507 - Reading the Image

      
      
       The module examines the development of the western tradition of the visual arts from the Renaissance to the late twentieth century, looking specifically at issues about the representation of time and space in painting and related arts.  The module begins with the invention of linear and atmospheric perspective in the Renaissance and looks at the development of these compositional techniques and the tradition of visual illusion they underpin in Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries.  The course looks at the theories of Alberti and Humanist writers and in particular the role played by perspective in advancing the narrative tradition of painting.  The module goes on the examine the critique of the Renaissance tradition in the later 19th Century and the breaking away from the tradition of perspective in modernist painting.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      FI624 - Beyond Cinema

      
      
       From the intimate viewing experience offered by mobile phones to the social interaction required by sing-a-long screenings, this module considers the changing nature of where, when and how audiences engage with film and the moving image. It considers the history of cinema-going, paying attention to the old and new sites of exhibition, especially those facilitated by new technologies. Connectedly, the module analyses the different modes of spectatorship, including audience participation and the desire to prolong or enhance the cinematic experience via extra-filmic activities, such as film-tourism. It also considers films interaction with other arts and mediafor example, its use within theatrical performances and its relationship with television. In doing so, this module reflects upon and reconsiders the definitions and limits of cinema and addresses the implications this has for the academic discipline Film Studies.

      ART500 - Independent Project

      
      
       Students who wish to take the module must approach a permanent academic member of staff with a proposal, typically in advance of module registration, during the Spring term of the previous year. Students pick a research topic of their choice; however, students are only allowed to register for the module with the permission of a staff member who has agreed to supervise the project, and who has the expertise to do so. Potential supervisors must also ensure before they agree to supervise a project that the resources required to complete the project will be available to the student, and that adequate supervisory support will be available to the student throughout their study on the module.Students will be supported in the preparation and submission of their work by their supervisor, although a central expectation of the module is that students will take increasing responsibility for their learning, consistent with expectations of H-level study.

      FI622 - Television Series: Narration, Engagement and Evaluation

      
      
       The module explores storytelling in fictional television series, and how the long duration of these series changes the spectators engagement, as compared to engagement in the relatively short fiction film. Furthermore, this module focuses on case studies in order to investigate their narrative, stylistic and thematic characteristics, their specific genre conventions and their background in television history. Case studies may include The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Madmen in an inquiry into the narrative as well as moral complexity of this recent, so-called quality trend of American drama television series, and the emerging genre convention of the antihero. The module also addresses how various types of television series have been valued in critical reception through the history of television. For example, in relation to the case studies mentioned above, the module may examine critically the implications of the oft-used label Quality TV and the HBO slogan Its not TV, its HBO. In addition to introducing the students to current developments in television studies, this module takes a film theoretical, narratological approach to current television series, and trains students in various approaches to the study of television series in and beyond television studies proper.

      FI582 - New York and the Movies

      
      
       This module examines the way New York has been used as a site for filmmaking, looking at the history of the production of films in and about the city, and as a vital centre of film culture -- not just of filmmaking, but also exhibition and film criticism. Beginning with an examination of film, and modernity, with a specific focus on late silent/early sound film production, the module then shifts to look at avant-garde practice in New York during the 1950s and 60s, and concludes by considering the citys representation in mainstream Hollywood productions with a particular focus on generic crime movies and/or romantic comedies.The work on New York and film will be contextualised within a cultural history of the city, with a dual emphasis on narratives of immigration and the city as the postwar centre of the world art market.

      FI584 - The Gothic in Film

      
      
       This module will investigate the Gothic as a significant and recurring cycle within Hollywood film with recognisable tropes and themes, and a dominant tone and style. Beginning with the cycle of Womens Gothic which emerged at the same time as Film Noir, and visually and thematically overlapped with it, the module will explore the particularly filmic ways that such texts manage to evoke the menacing atmosphere and the tone of sexualised danger and suspense achieved by the Gothics source novels and short stories. Continuing from the original cycle of 1940s films, the module will examine later Hollywood films that have employed the themes and imagery of the Gothic to tap into similar complex anxieties and desires, before inspecting films from other cinemas (for example, those of Europe and Asia) which also make use of the dominant Gothic tropes.

      FI585 - Film Criticism

      
      
       This course introduces students to the history and theory of film criticism, emphasising the coexistence of different approaches to the analysis, evaluation and appreciation of film. The module will also have a practical aspect, offering students the opportunity to write critical pieces on the films screened for the class. In addition to traditional lectures and seminars, some sessions will be devoted to writing and to analysing fellow students' work. Participants will also be encouraged to reflect critically on different media of film criticism (newspapers, magazines, academic journals, the internet, television) and on the current state of film criticism.

       This course investigates some major aesthetic, political, and theoretical trends of postwar European cinema. Students are introduced to a selection of European films as well as to the writings of key Continental filmmakers, theorists and critics. Students will examine the new waves from France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, and the neo-realism originating in Italy, as well as movements such as Dogme '95. The module also looks at the impact of popular European genre cinema, including analysis of the horror movie and the Spaghetti Western. In addition, the module will also have a contemporary scope, with a study of more recent developments in European film. The films will be examined for their claims to interpret the real world, their relationship to films in other national contexts, and also be interrogated for the economic and artistic motivations behind their existence as critical categories.

      FI617 - British Cinema

      
      
       In a country with a very strong literary and theatrical tradition, the British have also had a long-standing love of "going to the pictures."  For more than a century, British filmmakers have been forging a rich and diverse national cinema in the face of Hollywoods dominance on British screens for most of that time.  This course will offer an introductory historical overview of British cinema from its beginnings to the present day, assessing its role in the construction of British national identity, evaluating its major directorsincluding Humphrey Jennings, Ken Loach and Sally Potter.  The films will be approached through multiple frameworks, including consideration of aesthetics (e.g. realism), culture (e.g. gender and class), and history (e.g. the legacy of colonialism).  The institution of cinema and film culture in a larger sense will be considered through the exploration of British film exhibition, criticism, cultural policy, and industry.  Both fiction films and documentaries will be discussed.

      FI608 - Film Authorship

      
      
       This module will offer students the rare opportunity to examine in detail the work of a single director or a group of directors. It will thus enable students to acquire a more complex understanding of the issues at stake in the production, distribution, and reception of a specific body of film work. The module will also develop students knowledge and understanding of the questions, theories and controversies, which have informed critical issues and theoretical debates on film authorship. It will thus appeal to students who wish to extend their skills in analysing film form, meaning, and practice in both a conceptual and a historical context. Furthermore, as the module will enable detailed consideration of what film directing is, as an artistic and cultural practice, in given contexts, it will be a very useful course to combine with the practical study of filmmaking.

       The module primarily focuses on contemporary digital filmmaking practices and film viewing. The first section of the module introduces trick cinema, special effects, the digital intermediate, and a range of computer generated images to explore the different opportunities these offer for manipulating space, constructing narratives and aesthetic innovation. The second section of the module more explicitly engages with a range of theoretical frameworks in order to think about how digital technologies alter our understanding of film, its relationships with other media, and the ways in which we participate in film culture.

      FI555 - Screenwriting: An Introduction

      
      
       This module offers students an introduction to the terms, ideas and craft, involved in the creation of screenplays.  Screenwriting is a unique form of writing with very different concerns from the novel, theatre and radio. Although the screenplay is a vital component of a films success, it tends to be neglected as a separate art form.In this module we explore the conventions of dramatic structure, new narrative forms and short film variations.  Students are  encouraged to think critically about screenplay writing and will have an opportunity to write their own screenplay.  A selection of writing exercises have been designed to take them through the writing process; from preparation and initial concept to final draft.The emphasis here will be on practical knowledge and support as students uncover their creative voice. This module does not aim to provide vocational training for students wishing to pursue careers in the feature film or television industries.

      FI559 - Sound and Cinema

      
      
       Cinema has typically been conceived of as an essentially visual phenomenon  films, it is often said, are essentially moving pictures. Sound has, nevertheless, played an important role from the beginnings of cinema, a fact which has been acknowledged in the detailed historical, theoretical and critical work on film music, and film sound more generally, produced over the last decade. Sound and Cinema will provide an overview of this new field of research, and aim to provide students with a clearer understanding of and greater sensitivity to the soundtrack. The course will begin by setting up an introductory framework for the understanding of sound, which considers the relationship between music and other aspects of film sound (dialogue, voice-over, effects), as well as the nature of the relationship between image and sound. Subsequent sessions will consider the evolution of sound technology and its impact on the aural aesthetics of film; the use of classical and popular music in film scores; the emergence of sound designers, such as Walter Murch and Alan Splet, in contemporary cinema; and the distinctive and innovative use of sound and music by such diverse directors as Wim Wenders, Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch, and William Raban.

      FI501 - Documentary Cinema

      
      
       This module addresses a series of documentary films in their historical context and in relation to the different modes of non-fiction filmmaking. Documentary narrative techniques including the use of archival footage, staged reconstructions of past events, and talking-head interviews, are investigated by means of close textual analysis and through a comparative approach to diverse documentary films. This module also explores the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction and, while articulating a definition of documentary film, it studies film forms that present an interplay between the two, such as Mockumentaries and Essay Films.

      FI527 - Storytelling and the Cinema

      
      
       This module examines different forms of narrative and story-telling in cinema, drawing upon theories of myth, folk and fairytale as well as upon anthropological studies of oral storytelling in order to place film narration within the tradition of the popular arts. The psychological and aesthetic role of narrative will be explored through the accounts offered by philosophy and psychoanalysis in order to understand the relations and tensions between narrative realism based on Aristotelian notions of cause and effect as well as character verisimilitude, and popular and avant-garde modes which transgress such notions.  The role played by, for example, film genres and the star system in disrupting or supporting narrative cause and effect will be considered.   The function of the script and of script-writing will be looked at in relation to the deployment of the cinematic elements of sound and image, spectacle and event in film.  The course will be taught through a series of case-studies using a wide range of films within American and world cinema.

      HA668 - Transatlantic Dialogues: British and American Art c. 1900-1970

      
      
       The development of British and American art reveals patterns of affinity, divergence and mutual interplay, against a backdrop of the wider of an international Modernism centred to a large degree on Paris. This module examines such themes as the following: the currency and influence of realist, abstract, and surrealist aesthetics in the first decades of the 20th century(focussing on figures such as Walter Sickert, Edward Hopper, Ben Nicholson, Stuart Davis, Henry Moore); the impact of the Second World War (and of Picassos Guernica as an exemplary artistic response to conditions of war); the emergence after the war of painterly abstraction (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Peter Lanyon), alongside new approaches to expressive figuration (Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon); the development of constructed sculpture (David Smith, Anthony Caro) and post-painterly abstraction (Frank Stella, Bridget Riley) on either side of 1960; parallel manifestations of Pop, Minimalist, Conceptual and Land Art (Richard Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Richard Long, Robert Smithson); attitudes to photography as an artistic and documentary medium (Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus).

      HA504 - Classicism and Baroque

      
      
       The organising principle of this course is derived from Giovanni Pietro Belloris Vite de Pittori et Architetti Moderni (1672). In selecting a small group of twelve exemplary artists for his history, Bellori was employing artistic biography to expound his theory of art based on the Idea. This charted a middle way between naturalism and mannerism, through which the imitation of nature informed by the principles of antique art produced works which surpassed nature. Among the artists included in Belloris corpus are Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Michelangelo da Caravaggio, and the non-Italian artists Nicolas Poussin, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. Several of the leading artists of the period were excluded from the canon, notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Bellori presumably had these artists in mind when he condemned his contemporaries who juggle madly with corners, gaps and twirling lines, discompose bases, capitals and columns with stucco nonsense, trivial ornament and disproportions. The aesthetic and theoretical judgements which informed Belloris exclusion of artists from his book can be glimpsed in this quote. In the art historical literature on this period such critical judgements are explained in terms of the dichotomy between classicism and the baroque (although these were not terms used in the period). Following Riegl and W&ouml;lfflin the baroque has been defined in opposition to classic art, as an art of becoming rather than of being, addressing the emotions, rather than the intellect, through a tactile evocation of appearances. Often the theoretical writing of the period has been characterised as reacting against, or irrelevant to, what was truly innovative about the work of baroque artists like Bernini and Borromini. These generalisations will be tested through close study of the works of the artists named above, and also by exploring how they might relate to contemporary artistic debates, such as those at the French Acad&eacute;mie Royale about the relative merits of Poussin and Rubens, or between Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona in Rome over the number of figures which should be included in a narrative painting. In addition to exploring the acute interest in stylistic criticism during the seventeenth century, the study of individual artists will also involve consideration of the role played by their patrons, especially their ideological, religious and antiquarian concerns. Although the course will progress by studying individual artists in roughly chronological order, the treatment will be thematic rather than monographic. Lectures at the beginning and end of the course will introduce and summarise the more general historiographical themes; the remaining lectures will be on artists including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Bernini, Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, Poussin, Rubens and Van Dyck.

      HA595 - Visual Arts Writing

      
      
        This module will be for final year students who are interested in gaining employment within the art and heritage press and/or marketing sectors. It will complement the vocational and work-based emphasis of the existing HPA Internship module (HA579). It will comprise a series of taught seminars supplemented by visiting speakers from the art/trade press, and from across the marketing and heritage sectors [6-8 speakers per module delivery]. NB: This is not an NCTJ validated course and makes no pretence at providing the full competencies of such. What it will provide will be an introduction to a range of press and related activities within the visual arts and heritage sectors. It will be of relevance for those students considering the possibility of working within these areas and for those who wish to explore some of the practicalities of researching and submitting copy and undertaking related promotional and marketing activities. The module will start by considering examples from the range of trade, specialist and institutionally affiliated publications which service the art and heritage markets. It will consider their target readerships, commissioning practices and particular subject and industry angles. Publications such as The Antiques Trade Gazette, The Art Newspaper, Tate Magazine and Art Monthly will be among those evaluated. Seminars will introduce some of the basic principles of trade writing: standing up and presenting copy proposals for commissioning; adapting copy to differing house-styles; preparing for and undertaking interviews for writing briefs and useful sources of information for generating ideas for prospective writing projects. Seminars will also consider the arts-related promotional work typically undertaken by press and marketing departments within auction houses, public art galleries and within government-funded organisations such as the British Council, and those local and regional authorities with heritage related responsibilities and sections (Canterbury City Council, Medway Unitary Authority etc).

      HA556 - Art and Film

      
      
       Art & Film will explore the longstanding relationship between these visual media and the different ways this relationship has been conceived and evolved over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Though special emphasis will be placed on the post second world war period, which has seen artists and filmmakers increasingly exploring intermediality, the course will begin by examining the field of visuality out of which cinema emerged and will look at the shared visual traditions that existed between them within the rapidly changing visual culture of the nineteenth century. The development of cinema and photography will be examined in relation to new technologies for the production of visual knowledge and imagery and the new modes of spectating that accompanied their inception. During the course students will deepen their understanding of the impact of critical theories on art and culture on the production and reception of works of visual art by being introduced to key critical texts. Within this context the course will also look at institutional frameworks and settings (e.g. the museum, the gallery, the cinema etc.) in which works of art and films are produced and viewed, examining how these settings inflect the experience of those works.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA559 - Abstraction And Construction in 20th Century Art

      
      
       The development of Abstract Art is one of the distinctive features of the 20th Century. In this module we will examine the roots of the aspiration to allow the object to evaporate like smoke in European and Russian art, and the establishment of Constructivism as a central force in artistic practice in 20th century art. The spiritual, philosophical and social ideas (and ideals) of key artists (such as Malevich, Tatlin, Kandinsky, Mondrian and Klee) are considered in relation to their artistic practice; the work and ideas of American abstractionists are addressed through an examination of legendary figures such as Rothko, Pollock and Stella; discussion of Nicholson, Moore, and de Sta&euml;l, among others, enables us to think about the response of the British and European artworld to the challenges and opportunities of abstraction and construction. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists make use of this radical tradition. Throughout the module we will raise the question of how to make, think about and respond to an art without objects.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA575 - Beauty in Theory Culture & Contemporary Art

      
      
       After decades of neglect, beauty has made a controversial return both in contemporary art and as a concept in contemporary aesthetics, art theory and criticism. In very different ways, beauty can be seen in the work of artists as diverse as Vanessa Beecroft, Chris Ofili, Robert Mapplethorpe, Gary Hume and Jenny Saville, and it has been rehabilitated as a critical term in the writings of critics such as Dave Hickey and Arthur Danto.The module examines the issues raised by this recent resurgence of beauty. Looking at the concept of beauty, the roles of beauty in culture and society, and its presence in contemporary art and theory, the module explores the issues that make the return of beauty such a controversial topic. The module will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines to examine the place of beauty: classic philosophical texts (Plato,  Kant, Lessing), contemporary philosophy (Levinson, Gaut, Nehamas, Walton, Zangwill, Hepburn), cognitive and evolutionary science (McMahon, Etcoff), art criticism (Danto, Hickey, Beckley), art history (Gombrich, Clark), sociology and cultural theory (Wolff).  In addition, a range of traditional, modern and contemporary artists will be discussed, including Goya, Warhol, Orlan, Duchamp, Picasso, Goldsworthy, Rubens, Ofili, Poussin, Serrano, Metsys, Velazquez, Motherwell, Rembrandt, Mangold.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA586 - Photographic History & Aesthetics 1: Realism in Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module begins with an exploration of the history and pre-history of the invention of various photographic technologies, along with the early uses to which these technologies were put. Particular attention is given to the early cultural and intellectual impact of the invention of photography, especially its use as a recorder of the appearance. After considering an example of the kind of predominate modernist art theory that made photography problematic as a realist art form, the emergence and development of realist photographic theory in various guises is explored through a number of key authors and seminal texts. Having explored a wide variety of realist theories, the difficulties of reconciling a realist photographic practice with traditional accounts of aesthetic significance is discussed along with possible responses. The module closes by considering the rise of digital imaging and the end of the realist aesthetic among fine art photographers, as well as exploring the implications of this new technology for our understanding of what a photograph is. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
