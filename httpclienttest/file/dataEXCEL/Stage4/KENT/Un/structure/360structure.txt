Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PO326 - Introduction to Political Science

      
      
        This core module introduces students to the wide range of different methodologies commonly employed in political science. This includes the scientific method and both traditional and newer forms of research. Students will also be introduced to some of the fields of inquiry that dominate the study of politics, including public choice, social movements, political behaviour, economic development and democracy. The module integrates these two main components to create both an awareness of the breadth of political science and its approaches, ultimately providing students with the foundation for further study in political science. Substantive topics include: the nature of inquiry (questioning and determining what constitutes evidence), methods of comparison, theory and hypotheses. They will also be introduced to and explore quantitative methods, formal methods, experimental methods and empirical quantitative methods. Students will implement basic quantitative research techniques for themselves. Finally, they will be introduced to concepts such as equivalence, selection bias, spuriousness, value bias and ecological and individualist fallacy in order to illuminate the difficulties faced when making comparisons. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO327 - Introduction to Comparative Politics

      
      
       The module introduces students to the empirical study of the key structures, institutions and processes in political life. It does so through the lens of the comparative method, in which political systems are compared and contrasted to test hypotheses about the factors producing similarities and differences across countries and over time. The module first introduces the comparative method, and then discusses the different ways in which political systems can be organized and classified. It focuses on the three key powers in all political systems  executive, legislative and judicial  the intermediate actors that link people to their governments, namely political parties, interest groups and the media, and how citizens behave politically in relations to such institutions and actors. Throughout the module, students are encouraged to identify the factors and the processes leading to different political outcomes across states and over time and to use both qualitative and quantitative data to support their arguments.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW313 - A Critical Introduction to Law

      
      
       The module will introduce students to critical legal techniques grounded in critical legal and social theory, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial theory and law and the humanities. Throughout the course, concepts are introduced through socio-legal and critical investigation of selected case studies - such as new pieces of legislation, emerging political campaigns and prominent litigation - ensuring that the course maintains a focus on law in action. Particular attention will be paid to developments in foreign jurisdictions and in the international arena. Accordingly, case studies will alter from year to year, and draw heavily on research projects on-going in the Law School. The course has a heavy focus on primary legal materials and core critical texts, but will also draw on film, museum artefacts, art and literature as appropriate.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LW315 - Introduction to Obligations

      
      
       This module introduces the law of obligations, which comprises the private law of duties and rights to which individuals and organisations are subject.  Traditionally, it includes the law of contract and tort (but not property). As well as introducing some of the content (which is covered more extensively in LW597 The Law of Obligations), a key focus is on the institution of the common law through which most of the law of obligations has emerged.  This aspect is especially explored through the case classes, which run alongside the lectures and seminars.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW316 - Foundations of Property

      
      
       Property is something we tend to presume we know about, and rarely examine as an idea or practice closely. Most often we use it to connote an object or thing, and presume that it has something to do with ownership of that object. It is so simple to say my property or this is mine. This module begins to unpack and examine the ideas and practices of property more closely: How are property claims constructed? What do we mean by ownership? What happens when a number of competing ownership claims in one object exist? When preparing for the module it will be useful to think about (and collect material on) current debates over contested ownership (or use) of property and resources: art collections or cultural artefacts, land or natural resources dispossessed, land squatted, etc. And why, in our jurisdiction in particular, has such a strong link been made between being a property owner (in this context a home-owner) and a good citizen.

      LW327 - The English Legal System and Skills

      
      
       Part A: English Legal SystemThis module provides an overview of the English Legal System, including the following indicative topics:1) An introduction to Parliament and the legislative process2) The court structure and the doctrine of precedent3) An introduction to case law, including how to identify and the importance of ratio decidendi and obiter dicta Part B: Introduction to Legal SkillsThe module also gives students an introduction to the basic legal skills that they will develop further in their other modules throughout the degree. The focus here is on specific exercises to support exploration and use of the library resources that are available, both in paper copy and electronically through the legal databases, and on understanding practices of legal citation.

       Credits: 4 credits (2 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      LW593 - European Union Law

      
      
       This 15 credit spring term undergraduate law module is designed to introduce law students to foundational legal principles of the European Union (EU). It will place particular emphasis on studying the role and impact of the judicial institution of the EU, namely the Court of Justice of the EU, in interpreting the scope and effects of Union law. This module builds on the knowledge that students acquire in Public Law 1 where they are provided with a basic introduction to the history of the EU, the main institutions of the EU and key constitutional issues arising from the supremacy of EU law. It will focus predominantly on certain aspects of EU law not addressed in Public 1, including the free movement rules underpinning the single market. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW597 - The Law of Obligations

      
      
       This module builds on LW315 An Introducton to Obligations by examining in more depth the grounds of liability in contract and tort.  The focus on reading cases is retained with regular case classes, and this is supplemented by a focus on legislation where relevant as well as theoretical material.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LW598 - Equity and Trusts

      
      
       This module, normally taken in Stage 2, introduces the student to the main principles and doctrines of equity and trusts. It is designed to challenge the somewhat dull image of this area of law and to encourage a critical and imaginative understanding of the subject. The law of equity and trusts is contextualized within a historical, social and jurisprudential inquiry thereby providing a much wider range of possible interpretations of its development and application. What then becomes central to the modules approach is the complex interrelation of law with ethical, political, economic and jurisprudential considerations, and that between legal outcomes, pragmatic concerns and policy objectives. Drawing upon the students experience of the study of law, in particular that gained from Foundations of Property Law and Property Law, this module examines the trust both as a private legal institution (the trust in family and commercial settings) and a public one (the charitable trust), placing special emphasis on the management of the trust and the powers, duties and obligations of the trustee. Yet in departing from conventional approaches this module does not study equity merely in regards to its role as the original creator of the trust. Equity is instead acknowledged to be what it really is - a vital and fruitful component of the English legal system; a distinct form of legal interpretation possessing its own principles and method of legal reasoning, and comprising an original and continuing source of legal development in the sphere of remedies.

      LW599 - Land Law

      
      
       The focus of the module is private property in English land: title by registration; squatting; owner-occupation; leases; covenants and land development. It builds on the Foundations of Property module to develop an in-depth understanding of English land law, its conception of property and its politics and effects. And it gives experience in how to advise clients on land law problems  and on how to avoid problems for clients.

      LW592 - Public Law 2

      
      
       The module builds on the understanding of constitutional government developed in Public Law 1 to examine the changing nature of the state in new modes of governance and governmentality.  The focus is on the shift away from the vertical character of the relationship between state and citizen to a more diffuse mode of governing populations through expertise, techniques of management, and biopolitics. In recent times there has been a shift away from states governing through legislation as a mode of command and control. Legislation is increasingly understood as enabling administration and governance rather than as the definitive word on a social or political problem.  In some respects, this is a continuation of legislation as a mode of authorising the exercise of public power.  However, the nature of power deployed and regulated through legislation has changed.  Government through officials or agents directly responsible to Ministers or Parliament is increasingly replaced by quasi-government authorities  (QUANGOS) whose strength is technical expertise. While the administrative state as it has evolved in the last century views this shift as a new strength in public administration, the key weakness is that accountability in the exercise of public power is lacking.  What are the implications of these transformations for public law?  How has public law facilitated these developments? What are the socio-legal and critical legal responses to these developments? These are the central concerns of this module.  It thus offers a specialised and complementary extension of themes and issues introduced to students in Public Law 1 in Stage 1 of the LLB degree.  The administrative authorities that have emerged in the era of the new administrative law  post 1970s - lack the formality of liberal constitutional protections.  Consider the relative informality in the administration of ASBOS. Moreover, the traditional public/private divide has broken down -  e.g. the privatisation of prisons, private corporations providing public services such as nursing homes or transport. The absence of social consensus, or unitary sovereign power has meant that the governance of gambling, security, the environment, gender and sexuality, science and technology, are not phenomena that can be dealt with through traditional liberal concepts or constitutional mechanisms.  This module will examine how public law has been the site of social, political, and legal contestations regarding these issues.

      PO661 - Fact, Evidence, Knowledge and Power

      
      
       This module is currently under revision as we are adjusting its contents to the changes we have made last year to our first year courses. Students will be emailed updated module information as soon as the review is completed. The revised PO661 module will build on and develop students knowledge of the approaches and methods used in the study of politics and international Relations introduced in the first year of the degree program and the foundation in the analysis of quantitative data established in the second year. We will consider the nature and purposes of descriptive and causal analysis in politics and international relations, thereby developing skills in choosing, using and evaluating the research designs and techniques for the collection and analyses of data used by researchers in these fields.  Emphasis in the course will be placed on a mixed methods approach to political analysis that enables student to integrate, analyse and evaluate both qualitative and quantitative information. In addition to developing a conceptual and theoretical understanding of different approaches to evidence gathering and analyses and how they can be combined, students will also have the opportunity to extent their skills in practical data analyses.

      PO657 - Political Research and Analysis

      
      
        The study of social and political phenomena is a vast endeavour and this class will serve as an introduction to methods for social science research. This 15 credit intermediate-level module is normally taken in Stage II. It provides a basic, non-technical introduction to the use of quantitative methods in the political sciences for students from a variety of educational backgrounds (including those with very limited knowledge of mathematical terminology and notation). The progression of this course will address scientific research design and methodology and consider many examples of such research In short, it seeks to enable students to read, interpret, and critically assess arguments drawing on quantitative methods in Politics and International Relations. Students with some prior exposure to quantitative methods will have the opportunity to improve their command of statistical software as well as apply their general statistical skills to data sets commonly found in policy and academic work.The module is divided into two main components: In the first part, students will be introduced to both the logic of empirical research in the social sciences and to basic concepts and techniques of descriptive uni-, bi-, and multi-variate data analysis. The second part will focus on uni-, bi-, and multi-variate inferential statistics. ICT skills will be acquired/enhanced of students by the introduction to and use of statistical software (SPSS). The focus will be on student-centred learning and critical reflection of selected examples of quantitative work in seminars and group work.

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      LW601 - Advanced Level Criminal Law

      
      
       While the curriculum for LW508 Criminal Law Level I and LW601 Advanced Criminal Law Level H  is by and large the same in that the same topics are considered, students following the course at level H will consider each discrete topic to a much greater depth making use of, and improving, skills developed in earlier years of their degree programme.The module is structured to provide students with the opportunity to explore the major issues in criminal law through class presentation, through consideration of essay style topics and to engage in critical analysis of topics by considering criminal law problem questions. Students will be expected to discuss particular issues of criminal law and their implications for a wider social context. At the commencement of the module students are provided with a Seminar Workbook which outlines the weekly seminar topic and task.

      PO664 - Conflict Analysis and Northern Ireland: History, Politics & Culture

      
      
       This course will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the recent political history of Northern Ireland. The course will be accessible to all students, whether they are new to the topic or not. The main objective of the course is to provide students with a greater understanding of one of the most complex regions within the United Kingdom. Students who take the course will learn about the central issues that underpinned community conflict, why sectarian conflict broke out in the region in the late 1960s, why it continued for so long, and what political dynamics led to the peace process of the 1990s. In addition to looking at the conventional historical and political development of Northern Ireland, the course will also focus on wider aspects of the society such as representations in Irish poetry, music and sport, and the way in which these have mirrored political and cultural relationships within the region.

      PO665 - Advanced Topics in Politics and International Relation

      
      
       This module is designed to offer Stage 3 Politics and International Relations students an opportunity to study a topic in politics and international relations at an advanced level. Participation will be limited to students who have demonstrated strong writing and analytical skills in their Stage 2 coursework (with a minimum average of 60%) and the topics may vary from year to year depending on the research and teaching interests of academic staff. The module will build on the concepts, theories and methods that students have acquired in their previous studies, introducing them to more advanced readings and further developing their knowledge and understanding of the scholarship at the forefront of their discipline in a given issue area. Students will work very closely with academic staff and will benefit from their research expertise and individual feedback in a small group setting. The module will assist students in developing their critical and analytical skills and help them to understand the uncertainty, ambiguity and limits of knowledge concerning their advanced topic in politics and/or international relations.FOR THE 2015/2016 ACADEMIC YEARThree topics will be offered: two in the Autumn Term and one in the Spring Term. Students may only take one topic within this module. Topic title: Global Gender Justice (Autumn Term)This module addresses some of the complex issues regarding achieving justice for women internationally through a thematic examination of classical and cutting-edge scholarship in the areas of gender, security, and human rights. We will interrogate practices of representation of women as victims and explore the cultural, religious, political, and social challenges and barriers to achieving gender justice within the family, the community, the state and global society. We will analyse the effectiveness and limits of international organisations, international human rights instruments, NGOs and activists to bring about change in womens lives. The seminar will be guided by an overall aim to explore the extent to which gender inequality within the state has an impact on state behaviour, with a specific focus on state development and state security. Students gain an awareness of the following themes: the situation of women around the world; the ways in which gender affects social, political, and economic status; the evolving study of gender in international politics (with an emphasis on security and human rights); the political implications of scholarship; and the links between gender, feminism, and activism. The seminar requires previous knowledge of international relations, but will introduce students to feminist theories relevant to the study of gender in international relations. The two-hour weekly seminar will involve a close reading of key texts as a group as well as discussion/debate of the weekly topics. Topic title: India in the twenty first century (Autumn Term)This course introduces students to the central issues and dynamics that define Indian politics today, situating these within their historical development. It examines the shifting dynamics of Indian party politics, the politics of economic reform, the causes and consequences of ongoing economic inequalities, the politics of welfare as well as the Maoist insurgency and its links to conflicts over economic redistribution. The course also examines the politics of identity focussing on how differences of caste, religion, language and region and the often violent conflicts these entail. It will then examine gender relations situating these in the context of social change and shifting power relations. Finally the course discusses the main issues and problems of Indian foreign policy, in particular Indias often fraught regional relations and the search for global power status. In the course of studying these topics, students will be introduced to the key scholars, themes and debates that have defined the political science and political economy literature on India. It does not presume any prior knowledge of Indian politics.Topic title: Russia and its Neighbours (Spring Term)The crisis over Ukraine from 2013 was stark demonstration of the failure to establish an inclusive and mutually legitimate system of European security and international politics after the end of the Cold War. On the one side, Russia was treated as a defeated power, even though the country did not see itself as such, and was assigned a modest role in world affairs. In the end this provoked a type of Weimar syndrome in a country whose dignity and interests were perceived to have been ignored. On the other side, the European Union and NATO have claimed to be advancing a type of post-modern politics in which traditional Westphalian notions of balance of power and geopolitical interests have given way to a benign notion of economic and normative homogenization. Two contrasting visions of world order came into contestation. The module will examine the evolution of Russian foreign policy since the end of the Cold War and its interactions with the EU and N

      PO630 - Politics of The Middle East

      
      
       This module introduces students into the study of the Middle East as a region and an arena of internationalconflict. Against the background of a historical review of the developments in the 20th century, the module willfocus on the colonial past of the region, the imperial legacy, the emergence of the Arab-Israeli conflict, theorigins of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the impact of sub-state loyalties  i.e. factors which have shaped theMiddle East as a region and as a security complex. In this context, the students will explore the ideologicaldevelopments in the region, most important among them, the rise and fall of Arab nationalism, the emergence ofIslamic radicalism and the consolidation of the Israeli right. Adopting an international relations perspective, themodule will also cover the impact of outside state actors, such as USA, Russia and the EU on the Middle Eastas a whole and on the relationships among those states that compose this region. Finally, the students will studythe debate about Orientalism and the problematic aspects of the Western academic study of the Middle Eastand the Islamic world. These issues will be addressed with a special focus on the problem of bias involved in theacademic study of the Middle East.

      PO666 - Religion and International Politics

      
      
       This module introduces students to the complex set of questions surrounding religion in international politics. The module begins by exploring contending political and sociological understandings of religion at the turn of the 20th century. It looks, in particular, at the constructed nature of the categories of the religious and the secular, and at the limits of the secularization thesis, which anticipated the privatization, decline and ultimately disappearance of religion in modernity. The discussion then turns to the relation between religion and secularism in Europe  with a focus on the question of European identity, multiculturalism, the relation between Europe and Islam and the numerous controversies surrounding Islam in Europe  and in the United States  with a focus on the concept of civil religion and the role of religious rhetoric and thinking in US foreign policy, particularly in the so-called war on terror. The module then explores the relation between religion and violence by looking at the role of the 16th and 17th wars of religion in the process of modern state formation and by asking whether there is a genuine connection between religion and violence. The concluding part of the module focuses on the emerging concept of the postsecular, its contending meanings, understandings and possible applications by focusing on the case of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

      PO667 - War and Peace in International Society

      
      
       The purpose of the module is to enable students to critically engage with the International Society (or English School) approach to International Relations. Combining political theory, IR theory, philosophy, sociology, and history this approach seeks to understand the theory and practice of international politics by reference to the historical development of relations between large scale political entities (from empires, hordes, kingdoms, to the modern nation-state and beyond) and the discourses that have emerged (Machiavellian, Grotian, Kantian) in response to the development of first European international society and eventually world society. The course focuses on the central features of international society - war and peace - as they have been conceived by the three traditions and members of the English School from Martin Wight to more contemporary figures.

      PO669 - Conservatism: Politics and International Relations of the Right

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to familiarise students with the conservative tradition in modern politics. This is achieved by reference to a range of key conservative thinkers selected by the module convenors to help students understand the diversity of the conservative tradition and consider what factors help to cohere it. Comparison within the tradition and across a variety of thinkers is achieved by examining these thinkers views on four basic categories of modern politics, namely the state, the market, society and international relations. In order to meet these broad learning outcomes, essay questions will be designed in order to ensure that students have to compare at least two thinkers. The module is structured around lectures and seminars. The module will be team-taught, allowing for a wider range of teaching and research expertise from both module convenors.

      PO675 - Politics and IR Internship

      
      
       This module blends practical workplace experience, in the form of an internship in the area of politics and international relations, with taught seminars and private study. The internship will allow students to experience first-hand the practical application of their degree subject in the wider world of work, and will provide the opportunity to develop transferable skills such as teamwork, communication and self-organisation. The taught seminars will provide an opportunity to reflect upon, and develop, knowledge of the sector and its relationship with the academic field of study, using the students internship experiences and a range of other resources. This will include input from School staff and alumni working in relevant fields, as well as appropriate support from employability and careers-guidance professionals.It will be the students responsibility to source and apply for internship opportunities, but assistance will be provided both by the Schools Employability, Internships, Placements and Alumni Relations Officer, and the Universitys Careers and Employability Service. These opportunities should be in an organisation whose aims and activities are broadly related to politics and international relations, and the internship should reflect these activities and give the student the opportunity to work in a way which allows the module learning objectives to be achieved. Students on pre-approved School-administered internships (currently those based with Kent Union and the Representation of the EU Commission to the UK) will also be eligible to take this module. The internship must consist of at least 60 hours of work, but this may be spread across a number of days / weeks and need not be a full-time position. The module convenor will approve of all internship opportunities prior to their commencement and students are advised to liaise closely with the module convenor and other appropriate staff in good time. Internships must finish by the date of the final seminar, and the School will provide all documentation  and relevant insurance  / health and safety checks  to ensure that the placement meets both University and sector requirements and guidance on work-related learning opportunities.

      PO658 - The Rise of China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of Chinas hegemonic role in pre-modern East Asia and its political development since the 1840s when it was forced to open up to the outside world and to lay a solid foundation for even more detailed study of present-day China. It deals with a recurrent theme in the study of Chinese politics, that is, how successive Chinese leaderships since the 1840s have reconciled Chinese indigenous political culture with models of modernisations that originated in the West. Focus is on how indigenous and foreign models for state-building and political development have guided Chinese thinking about national rejuvenation and modernisation. This module assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history or politics, and introduces students to the defining features of the Chinese traditional political system, including: Confucianism and Legalism, the causes of the demise of imperial China in 1911, the abortive attempts of republicanism and constitutionalism between 1912 and 1949, the rise of communism, and major political events since 1949 as well as its recent ascendancy. Questions to be explored in this module include: Why did the Chinese imperial system fail to meet the challenges and encroachment from the West and Japan? How did Chinese leaders understand modernisation? Why did Chinese political elites embrace communism? What have been the impacts of revolutions on Chinas external behaviour and relations, post-1949? How has Chinas worldview been socially constructed in its interactions with Western powers? What is Chinas grand strategy for development in the early 21st century?

      PO659 - Resistance, Suffering and Leadership

      
      
       This module will look at the political lives of three of the icons of contemporary world politics: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi. The module will begin with a brief introduction to biographical narrative as a method in political science. We will then discuss these three figures in three blocks of three weeks each, leaving one week for a concluding and comparative discussion (and one reading week). Throughout the module, the key themes of the title  resistance, suffering (sacrifice) and leadership  will serve as a focus as the module considers the lives of Gandhi, Mandela and Suu Kyi and their impact on world politics. Each block will first discuss the political life of the leader in question, after which one week will be devoted to some of his/her key primary writings, leaving one week to consider the meaning of resistance, suffering and leadership in each of the three lives.

      PO660 - International Conflict and Cooperation

      
      
       The course provides an overview of the broad field of international conflict analysis and resolution. Students have the opportunity to explore the motivations driving different forms of conflict, including interpersonal, group and civil violence. Students will also be exposed to a range of theories and approaches used to understand violent conflict, and a number of different methods of conflict resolution (e.g. negotiation, mediation, peacekeeping operations, and transitional justice.) The approach is interdisciplinary and juxtaposes traditional approaches used to study conflict management with new scientific studies of conflict and cooperation.

      PO653 - Marxism

      
      
       The module is aimed to introduce students to Marxist theory and to enable them to assess both the contemporary and historical significance of Marxism in world politics. Students are expected to read some of the key texts of Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels and to consider varied interpretations and critiques of Marxist methods, writings and theories. Students are also expected to consider the political contexts in which these theories and debates emerged and their implications for political practice. Students are not expected to demonstrate any detailed knowledge of the history of Marxist-inspired governments, regimes or political movements.

      PO654 - Politics of Deeply Divided Societies

      
      
       This module explores the linkages between mediation theory and the practice of conflict resolution in deeply divided societies. Topics include the theory and practice of negotiations, conflict escalation and peace mediations while specific emphasis will be given to the role of regional or international institutions in early conflict prevention. The module applies negotiation theory in the study of state disintegration, demographic and environmental conflict, property rights, federal management and transitional justice. The course engages with the core literature in negotiation theory and exposes students to a number of simulations aiming to improve negotiation skills (identifying best alternatives, revealing or not preferences, identifying win-win arrangements, defeating spoilers and exercising veto rights). Because of the practical skills taught in the module and the interactive nature of in-class simulations, students are expected to attend lectures and tutorials.  Finally, the course examines the role of citizens and community organizations in peace mediations focusing on a number of selected case studies from deeply divided societies specifically Israel/Palestine, the former Yugoslavia, South Africa, Greece/Turkey (including Cyprus & the Kurdish issue), Rwanda and Northern Ireland.

      PO655 - Public Opinion and Polling

      
      
       Democracy rests on the will of citizens.  But how can we identify this will?  Elections are one method; but more regular expressions of citizen views are possible via opinion polls.  Indeed, a range of public and private bodies routinely use polls to identify popular attitudes.  But what are the opinions supposedly revealed by these polls, how do surveys go about identifying opinions and how valid are their results?This module introduces students to the theory and practice of public opinion and its measurement.  The module focuses on two main questions.  First, what is public opinion?  How far do peoples attitudes pre-exist and how far are they instead shaped by the way questions are asked?  Are attitudes informed and considered, or are they largely knee-jerk responses based on little information?  If, in fact, citizens know little about politics, are there ways in which they can, nonetheless, form meaningful views on important public issues?  The answers to these questions are central to the task of assessing the proper role of public opinion in modern democracies.  The second question asks how public opinion is measured.  What are the main features of social surveys, and how well do they measure public attitudes?  This section of the module pays particular attention to the ways that different types of survey can affect the responses that people give, and to the principles and practices of effective survey design.

      PO656 - Humans at War

      
      
       This module aims to investigate the different roles and experiences of human beings at and in war. Following an introduction to issues regarding agency (How do people act in the social world? How much freedom do they have? What impact can their actions have?), the course will examine the roles of combatants (both state and non-state), civilians (men, women and children), and third parties (peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, journalists, and academics). The module will draw on academic literature, but also written, oral and video testimony and artwork to examine these categories first as a social group (examining questions such as age brackets, income brackets, education, life expectancy), then in terms of their political functions and roles, and finally in an attempt to access some degree of experiential knowledge of war and peace. Due to the sensitive nature of the material examined, the module will not be using lecture capture.

      PO634 - Understanding US Foreign Policy: War, Trans- formation and Terror

      
      
       This module offers a comprehensive study of US foreign policy since 1945. Ranging from containment, democratic enlargement, and the war on terror the module introduces students to the concept of grand strategy and the need to understand the broader intellectual platform and foundations of the way in which the United States engages with the world. A number of case studies are used to explore this such as the work of George Kennan, the Vietnam War, and the move towards smart power under presidents Bush and Obama. In addition  to this the course also explores questions on the social construction of state identity in the American national consciousness and how both the media and political elites help to shape public opinion and attitudes that relate to Americas friends, allies, and enemies. The course also explores the concept of soft power as a method of extending American influence and power in the world and questions the idea of American decline.

      PO638 - Political Behaviour in Britain

      
      
       The module examines the nature of political behaviour in Britain today.  It focuses on two key issues.  The first is the way that citizens participate in politics.  The module explores the nature of political participation, and how this has changed in the last few decades.  It also examines the characteristics of people who participate, and the factors that motivate individuals to engage in different forms of political participation.  The second key issue examined is voting behaviour.  The module considers how far electoral decisions are shaped by stable sociological factors, and how far voters today are less closely aligned with parties and more open to the influence of particular policy messages, personalities and media coverage.  Alongside this focus on the behaviour of citizens, the module also considers the activities of key intermediary organisations, such as legislators.  Throughout, the module seeks to develop students understanding and analytical skills, by considering theories and models of political behaviour along with the way data and other evidence can be brought to bear in testing the validity of these models.

      PO645 - Market States and Post Democracy

      
      
       This module is situated at the interface of political theory and political economy. It seeks to explore the complex and multi-faceted links between democracy and capitalism in the period from 1848 to the present day. The particular focus is on relations between the state and the market as well as the evolution of different democratic regimes and market economies. Similar emphasis will be on conceptual issues and empirical evidence (though no statistical or econometric skills will be required).The first part of the module examines the formation of 'market-states', beginning with a critical discussion of this concept. This will be the starting point for a wider engagement with Smithian, Marxist, Keynesian and neo-liberal accounts. The focus will be on those who theorise the conditions for the convergence of state and market. The second part turns to the evolution of democracy in relation to capitalism. A brief survey of the recent post-democracy literature will be followed by a discussion of key concepts. Examples include the conception of capitalism and democracy as "quasi-religions" (Walter Benjamin) and various arguments that formal democratic representation and abstract capitalist exchange engender a "society of spectacle".

      PO646 - Presidents, Parliaments and Democracy

      
      
       This module introduces students to central debates about the influence of different executive formats on democratic government. The course examines the differences between and within presidential, parliamentary and semi-presidential constitutions and examines their consequences for the quality of democracy and for policy outcomes. The course initially focuses on identifying the key institutions and processes that shape the behaviour and strategies of politicians in the executive, before moving on to consider the consequences of these for governance, policy-making and democratic stability. Throughout the central focus is on understanding the extent and the ways that formal political institutions may shape how politicians respond to citizen preferences, bargain with each other to resolve political conflict and choose policies. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about the impact of political institutions on politics, different ways of conceptualizing and measuring democratic performance and encouraged to think about how a broad range of other factors may interact with constitutional formats to shape outcomes. The approach used will be broadly comparative and will use case-specific and cross-national evidence from both developed and less developed democracies in all regions of the world.

      PO652 - Politics in the Classroom

      
      
       The module will begin with training sessions for the students in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of politics drawn from the national curriculum. These sessions will be run by the Partnership Development Office.After training the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a school in Spring term (this session includes time to travel to and from the School, preparation and debrief time with the teacher and in class time with the teacher and pupils  3 hours in total). They will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a topic or talk about aspects of university life. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of citizenship and politics within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project (final taught lesson) in consultation with the teacher and with the module convener. They must then implement and evaluate the project.

       This module explores the origins, evolution and role of international organisations in world politics. The aim is to understand how these institutions have developed, why states choose, refuse and fail to use these institutions as a means to achieve their objectives, and to what extent international organisations can promote international cooperation. The module takes the United Nations system as its central focus, but will also consider historical forms of international organisation as well as the processes of global governance. International organisations are involved in a wide variety of issues in contemporary international politics. This module will survey a selection of them, exploring the political differences and questions that arise in international responses to these issues.

      PO563 - Foreign Policy Analysis and Management

      
      
       This module examines the complex relationship between foreign policy analysis and foreign policy practice.  It does so by exploring shifting approaches to making and examing foreign policy, including the contributions of  IR theory to Foreign Policy Analysis. Historical antecedents of foreign policy as a practice are examined via observations of traditional bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, followed by traditional state-based actors, non-state actors, and the nature of the structure they inhabit. FP decision-making is then examined, followed by the process of foreign policy implementation. The issue of motivation is tackled through analyses of the largely domestic impact of culture, interests and identity and broader effect of intra-state norms, ethics, the issue of human rights. Case studies of key countries reinforce the practical implications of above-mentioned issues throughout the module.

      PO592 - Rights, Freedoms and Individualism:Contemporary Liberalism in Question

      
      
       Anglo-American countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, along with many Western European societies, have long prided themselves on their respect for liberal values. More recently, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and agitation for rights and civil freedoms in many Asian countries, liberalism has extended its reach as a source of political thought and action. Liberalism's values, practices and institutions are now admired, emulated, invoked and desired in many parts of the world. In this module, we look at liberalism as a philosophy of politics by studying the work of some of its major contemporary exponents and detractors. We examine the different approaches to liberalism advanced by figures such as John Rawls, Richard Rorty, and Will Kymlicka. To complement our understanding of liberalism, we consider the communitarian criticisms from thinkers like Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, the feminist criticism of liberalism by Susan Moller Okin, and the post-structuralist criticisms from Michel Foucault.

       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of China's political development in the 20th and early 21st centuries. After a brief overview of China's political history since 1949, it is designed around two core blocks of study.The first block looks at the principal political institutions that include the Communist Party, the government (the State Council), the legislature (the National People's Congress) and the military (the People's Liberation Army).The second block examines the socio-political issues and challenges facing the country in its ongoing development. They range from the prospects of democratisation and the growth of civil society, the issue of quality of life in the areas of the environment and public health, corruption, nationalism and ethnic minorities, national reunification, territorial disputes with neighbouring countries to China's engagement with global governance.A major theme of the module is to address why the Chinese communist regime is more durable and resilient than other non-democratic countries in achieving both economic growth and political stability and acquiring international influence, despite the fact that it faces numerous mounting development and governance  challenges.

       On any one day in Brussels hundreds of negotiations on European Union (EU) legislation take place on issues ranging from the regulation of financial services in Europe to the promotion of democracy in the EUs near neighbourhood.  The purpose of this module is to introduce students to the negotiation system that is European Union, how it has evolved politically since its creation and how it works, both in theory and in practice.  Students gain an in-depth understanding of the dynamic of European integration over time and the politics behind this process of integration.  Students will analyse the functioning and roles of the EUs main institutional bodies, investigate how legislation is produced and implemented and how the various political actors with a stake in EU decision-making interact both formally and informally. The module also addresses key political questions underpinning EU decision-making EU, such as political support for the EU amongst its citizens, the EUs underlying democratic legitimacy and finally its future development.

      PO612 - Policy-making in the EU

      
      
       Since the mid-1980s the EU has experienced an intense period of constitution building with the ratification of more than five amending treaties.  These treaty changes have significantly altered the Unions policy-making process both in terms of competence and policy reach.  Nearly every area of domestic public policy now has some European dimension.  At the same time the EU has also experienced deep economic crisis and increased questioning of the purpose and trajectory of European integration and policy-making.  The focus of this module is on the European Union (EU) as a system of public policy-making at the heart of all these changes. The module will address topics including: the evolution of various flagship EU policies including the Single Market programme, environmental policy, economic and monetary policy, foreign, security and defence policy, and justice and home affairs.  At the end of the module, students will be able to conceptualise and contextualise key developments in EU policy-making.  They will also be able to analyse the kind of political and economic order that has emerged in Europe today as well as the various challenges it faces.

      PO616 - The Politics of Trust (in the USA)

      
      
       Much recent academic and popular commentary has focused on citizens supposed mistrust of government, especially in the United States of America. The central aim of the Politics of Trust is to uncover the reasons for Americans malaise. However, students will also examine other western democracies where trust has fallen to see if these countries experiences can inform our understanding of the US case specifically and the politics of trust more generally. The course begins with a history of trust in America, with an overview of the putative reasons for declining trust in the post-World War II period, with an examination of the experiences of other western democracies. The second part turns to the specific explanations for declining trust as posited by academics and political commentators. Explanations include the crisis of government performance, spin, the internecine warfare between Republicans and Democrats, the changing nature of the modern labour market, declining social capital, and the media.

       PO617 offers a comprehensive introduction to the politics and national government of the United States. It introduces students to the foundations of the US political system, examining the history of the republic, its economy and society, the values and beliefs American people subscribe to, and the basic structure of the political system. We will also examine those intermediate institutions (interest groups, parties, elections and the media) that link people to their government, and the three key institutions of the federal government: the Congress, Presidency and Supreme Court. Lastly, we focus on the policymaking process in the US. We will look at economic policy, civil rights and liberties and foreign policy, ask how and why policy is made as it is, and examine the extent to which the policy solutions produced by the political system are optimal.

       The module examines the politics of transition and change in post-communist countries in their effort to establish new democratic regimes and find their place in the world. The module consists of three main parts.Part I focuses on the experience and nature of communist rule, to develop basic understanding of communism as an ideal, political system, and a life style. Part II looks at transitions, examining regional patterns of change and relating them to the 3rd and 4th waves (coloured revolutions) of democratisation globally. Part III discusses the issues of post-communist politics in Europe, by way of exploring the forms and quality of democracy in the new states, considering the effect of EU enlargements on the new Member States and the EU neighbours; and discussing the future of communism in the world.

      PO629 - Terrorism and Political Violence

      
      
       This module introduces students into the study of terrorism and political violence, and thereafter deepens theirknowledge of the controversial aspects of this subject. The initial lectures will deal with definitional problemsinvolved in the concept of terrorism and various theories about the causes of political violence in its differentforms. With a point of departure in a chronological review tracing the origins of the phenomenon long back inhistory, the module will later study the emergence of political terrorism during the second half of the 19thcentury. This will be followed by a study of state and dissident terrorism in different parts of the world. Themodule will also address the relationship between religious radicalism and different forms of political violence,including new terrorism and possible use of weapons of mass destruction. Then, the focus of attention will beshifted to implications of various counter-terrorism strategies and The War on Terrorism for democracy andhuman rights. These issues will be addressed with a special focus on methodological problems involved in thestudy of terrorism and political violence.

      LW583 - Art Law

      
      
       This module studies the development of Art law which has been shaped by a complex relationship between artists, dealers, auction houses, collectors, museums and the State. It has emerged from civil law, property law, criminal law, public law, private international law and public international law. It is regulated by a superposition of international treaties, European texts and national laws. Those different interactions have developed a less than coherent Art Law framework that will be comparatively analysed by reference to English, European and International Law. Topics to be discussed are (1) the definition of art in relation to law, cultural property, copyright and pornography (2) the actors of the market: the artist (his rights on the work of art, his freedom of creation and its limits), the dealers (dealers and auction houses), the expert and the collector (3) the sale of works of art: authenticity and counterfeit art, transfer of ownership of stolen art (4) the illicit trade of works of art in time of war (looting, spoliation during World War II) and in time of peace: conflicting national/European/international rules on the restitution of illegally exported, excavated and/or stolen works of art (5) museums: the legal character and obligations, staff, de-accession and (6) the role of the State: a non-neutral actor in the protection and support of art and the artists.

      LW584 - Forensic Science in Criminal Trials

      
      
       Please note: You do not need to have studied maths, science or probabilities to perform well on this module!Forensic evidence is a rapidly developing area in criminal trials  new techniques are continually being developed and forensic evidence such as DNA profiling is increasingly presented as evidence. This rapid expansion has resulted in forensic evidence becoming increasingly debated in the media and by the criminal justice process  from articles hailing DNA profiling as preventing or undoing miscarriages of justice to those questioning a lay jurys ability to make a judgement in case involving highly complex scientific or medical evidence. This module considers how the criminal justice system makes use of forensic science. Initially, analysis of the relevant rules of evidence will be made alongside a broad overview of forensic science in the courtroom.  This is then built upon through an exploration of case law and consideration of topical questions such as who should decide whether a new scientific technique should be admissible evidence, who are the experts who present the evidence to juries and the extent to which the admission of forensic evidence assists juries.

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

      LW586 - Environmental Law II

      
      
       Environmental Law II builds upon the themes introduced in Environmental Law I whilst placing central emphasis upon the environmental and ecological implications of land use and development, and the regulation of land use activities to secure protection of biodiversity. The module commences with some cross-cutting issues, encompassing civil liability for environmental harms and human rights in respect of the environment, before turning to consideration of regimes for restricting land use to prevent unacceptable kinds of environmental and ecological harm. This involves looking at land use development controls in national law and European Community requirements for environmental assessment of projects and plans to anticipate and mitigate the environmental impacts of development. This leads into a discussion of laws that are more specifically concerned with the protection of species and habitats, either through direct restrictions upon destructive activities or through legal mechanisms to secure biodiversity conservation through designation and management of land that is of ecological importance. In respect of each topic, the object is to place discussion of national and European Community laws into context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving environmentally and ecologically appropriate land use and conservation of biodiversity, and ultimately sustainable development.

      LW543 - Clinical Option

      
      
       Students on this module must become members of the Kent Law Clinic, and work under Supervisors on live cases for clients of the Clinic under the supervision of solicitors, or other experienced legal practitioners working alongside them. All Supervisors are members of the academic staff at Kent Law School. Students will develop their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of English law and procedure, and some specific skills. Students are encouraged to view their clinical work as a means to an end  not just the acquisition of important legal skills but primarily a better understanding and critical analysis of law and of legal practice. The excellent opportunity which clinical work provides for active learning, and for studying the interface between theory and practice, is placed firmly in this context.Students are expected to undertake from the second week of Autumn term onwards until the end of the Spring term, under supervision, the conduct of at least two substantial cases (or the equivalent), involving proceedings in courts or tribunals or other legal forums, or projects on an area of law of  relevance to the objects of the Clinic. Students will normally work on cases rather than projects. A Supervisor will decide whether a student has undertaken two substantial cases (or the equivalent) for the purposes of this module.

      LW552 - European Legal Systems

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide a basic introduction to the common characteristics which underpin the European (continental) legal systems with the object of providing students (particularly those on all of the four year European degree programmes) with a foundation upon which they can develop a more substantial knowledge of a continental jurisdiction. It will aim to provide a general grounding in the history, culture and mentality of the European legal systems and as such will focus upon the historical foundations, the institutional development and the methodological traditions. The starting point and foundation of the module will be the university tradition stemming from the rediscovery of Roman law in the 11th century and the development and transformation of this tradition over the subsequent centuries into the perceived axiomatic structure at one time thought to underpin the codes. Particular attention will be given to the French and German systems and contemporary developments within these systems will form the final part of the module.

      LW556 - Intellectual Property Law

      
      
       This module will examine the main forms or types of intellectual property (IP) rights: copyright, patents and trade marks (as well as the related topics of passing off and breach of confidence) that embody the notion of privatising the intangible fruits of the mind. About each of these IP forms, we will ask: what are the procedural requirements required for its creation as IP? Who is the owner of the IP and why is he/she the owner? What are the various rights given to the rights-holder? What constitutes IP infringement? What are the remedies available for IP infringement? But this is not an exclusively doctrinal module and we will continually look at pressing policy questions such as: why should we protect IP? How important is continuing access to the public domain? Should plants be the subject of a patent? Do employees get short-changed by the presumptions of IP law? Particular topics will vary from year to year, but may include copyright issues on the Internet, the impact of patents and copyright on socio-economic development in the global South, and questions such as: should musical parodies be permitted? Who benefits from IP? Should human genes be patentable? Should greater protection be given to whistleblowers? The focus will be on UK IP law, but we will regularly examine relevant EU directives and global IP treaties. The aim is not to provide a crash course in all aspects of intellectual property doctrine, but rather to examine a range of important practical and theoretical questions about a form of property that some commentators have called "the new wealth" of the 21st century.

      LW589 - The Skills of Argument - How to Argue and Win

      
      
       Argument occurs across the full spectrum of human interaction - in pubs, at home, in seminar classes, and in professional contexts such as those provided by law, science and medicine. However, despite the importance allotted to argument and the desire of those engaged in arguments to win them, little systematic attention is given to the nature of argument and the practical skills required to argue successfully, even though this information is readily available. The ambition of the module is to equip students with this knowledge base and skills, thereby enabling them to enter into argument more confidently and with a greater prospect of success.  The module divides into three parts, the first being a very brief historical and theoretical contextualisation of the topic. The second part of the module treats argument and arguing formally, by mapping the standard forms of argument and by developing the skill of picking out a bad argument from a good one, and by showing how to spot the set of common but typically unnoticed mistakes in ones own argument or in those of others. The third part of the module turns to the skills of rhetoric and persuasion, including examination of the ploys that are often used to give bad or weak arguments persuasive force. The themes of the module are illustrated throughout using real examples from law and elsewhere.

Topics will include marriage and civil partnerships, domestic violence, divorce and post-separation arrangements for property and children, legal parenthood and parental responsibility, child protection and adoption.There is no prescribed preliminary reading, but the following may be of interest to those who wish to undertake some pre-reading.Due to frequent changes in the law in this area, textbooks tend to go out of date, and new editions are published quite frequently.  The assigned textbook will be notified at the commencement of the module.

      LW570 - Law and Social Change

      
      
       This module aims to investigate the relationship between law, morality, and social change, and how this relationship has changed and may change over time.  In other words, it seeks responses to questions such as the following: How does law produce morality and morality produce law? What is the role of moral norms and obligation in legal practice? How does the character of law shift in response to social struggle? Why, if some modern social theories allow for the recognition of a vastly reduced number of valid norms, is moral discourse still the default mechanism for resolving conflicts in society? Has moral discourse been supplanted by other means of conflict resolution and social integration? How might we envision an ideal moral-legal framework?Typically its content will include: The meanings of law and social changeClassical Social Theory, law and Social ChangeContemporary social theory, law and social changeThe Hart/Devlin Debate: Law, Disgust, and Social ChangePositive approaches to the promotion of Social Change Feminism and Legal ReformThe Legal Profession and Social ChangeRights and citizenship

       This module focuses on governance, regulation, norm-maintenance and rule non-compliance within communities and institutions. It provides a distinct perspective to general questions of law, socio-legal theory, and jurisprudence. Key questions include: when do norms count as law? How do communities govern themselves, and what role do law and social norms play in this process? What authority do intentional communities possess when it comes to rule-breaking? What is the relationship between community rules and state law? Can communities function without rules? And is institutional law-breaking (or non-compliance) analogous to individual disobedience? Topics include: legal pluralism and legal consciousness, Foucault and governmentality, norm-following among strangers, etiquette within public sex communities, virtual worlds, governing through local currencies, nudism, self-regulation in a free school, and Speakers Corner.

      LW578 - Law and Political Theory

      
      
       This module will examine contemporary political and juridical problems by drawing on political theory in relation to sovereignty, law, and violence.  For instance, the notion of sovereignty is central to what is regarded as legitimate and illegitimate violence.  What is the difference, in political and juridical terms, between a young soldier who sacrifices her/his life for the nation and a suicide bomber whose death and dying also has a political agenda? How can institutional and legalised violence such as colonialism or apartheid be dealt with by individuals and social orders? Classical and contemporary political theory can help us to address such questions.  It will thus examine concepts and theories of sovereignty, community, and the individual subject.  Key texts of modern political theory, such as the writings of Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Schmitt will be considered. Contemporary theorists such as Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Talal Asad, and Veena Das will also be examined. The module will also draw on novels and film to explore the relationship between freedom and violence, suffering and memory, The examination of Case Studies will give students the opportunity to examine and understand the significance of political theory for dealing with contemporary legal issues and problems such as: terrorism, refugees, postcolonial law, war on terror, sovereignty in the EU, and Empire.

      LW580 - Consumer Law

      
      
       Consumer law and policy is a significant area of current UK and European Union market regulation. This module initially discusses the rationales for consumer law and the different forms of regulating consumer markets. We then look at topics such as deceptive and unfair advertising, standard form consumer contracts, consumer credit law, quality standards in the supply of goods and services, product safety, consumer redress and access to justice. Consumer law cuts across traditional doctrinal boundaries of private and public law and provides an opportunity for analysing a variety of forms of regulation such as private law, public regulation and enforcement, co-regulation, soft law, shaping market values, and harnessing market incentives.

      LW581 - Law and Literature

      
      
       So much of law is about text and the manipulation of language: Becoming sensitive to the construction of narratives in judgements, learning to read argument in its many forms, recognising the ways in which words, and patterns of words, can be used to create effect, playing with ambiguities or seeking to express an idea with clarity, all these are fundamental skills for a lawyer. Law is also about performance, the roles which are assigned to us and the drama of the court room. And law, as text and performance, carries fundamental cultural messages about the society we live in and the values we aspire to. During this module, we will examine some of the many ways in which reading, viewing and listening to, the arts helps us to think more concisely as well as more imaginatively about law. Our preliminary reading list is longer than usual, it is designed to give prospective students a taste of the range of material we will cover, as well as to suggest that it will be helpful to have undertaken some preliminary work before starting the module. We welcome on to the module anyone who shares, with us, an enjoyment of reading, viewing and listening  this is a chance to be introduced to material you may not be familiar with as well as a chance to pursue an interest you may already have. Although the module is designed primarily for law students, it is also open to undergraduates from other degree programmes.

      LW604 - Morality and Law

      
      
       This course will give students the opportunity to explore the ways in which morality has been understood and theorised and then to trace the development of a particular moral concept (namely, that of individual rights), that is central to legal discourse today. The methodology will be historical/contextual as well as theoretical/analytical. We will look at the way in which the idea of individual rights arose (and continues to develop) in a philosophical, political and historical context and we will examine and critically evaluate modern theories of rights and their relationship to law. The concept of a right is deceptively simple. When examined closely is gives rise to all sorts of questions and problems including, for example: how is the idea of a right justified? What is its relationship to the older idea of liberty? Can it survive the discrediting of theories of natural rights tied to natural law? Can it stand alone as a moral concept or is it merely the other side of a duty?Block 1: A critical introduction to the major theories of moral philosophy: virtue theory, duty based (deontological) Kantian theory and consequentialism (utilitarianism). Block 2:. A historical/contextual examination of the development of a particular moral concept; that of individual rights. Block 3.Oral presentations by students in pairs.Block 4.An analytical examination and critique of modern theories of rights and their relationship to law (incl. interest and will theories and the legal analysis of Wesley Hohfeld)

       This course will give students the opportunity to explore the ways in which moral reasoning can inform the study and practice of lawyering.  Students will be asked to think and argue about the (possible) moral dimension of the practice of law. The course will include a theoretical component during which we will explore ways in which we might justify (or deny) a moral dimension to the practice of law. In the practical component we will use case studies (including that of the US government lawyers who provided legal justifications for the use of torture on War on Terror prisoners). This case study and others will be used to discuss and debate issues in legal ethics, broadly conceived. The methodology will combine theoretical discussion of the principles that should inform the notion of legal ethics with analysis and discussion of actual moral and ethical dilemmas faced by lawyers and their resolution.Block 1: Why Legal Ethics? An exploration of the moral reasoning and arguments behind the idea of legal ethics. Do lawyers have moral responsibilities as well as legal ones? Block 2: Case studies and the ethical issues they raise. Answers to moral questions and dilemmas in legal practice.

      LW600 - Law, Science and Technology

      
      
       Science and technology play a significant part in the way law operates in contemporary states. This plays out at several levels: law is turned to in order regulate scientific and technological developments, and in so doing helps societies shape their futures; science and technologies are frequently used in providing the basis of legal decisions, and experts play an increasing part in decision-making, in courts and in governance. Both law and science, however, are complex social fields, and understanding their interaction requires careful theoretical and methodological tools. In this module, we interrogate some of these interactions, by exploring conceptual tools from several disciplines (including socio-legal studies, science and technology studies and anthropology), and applying them to particular case studies, including: the regulation of reproductive technologies; evidence in the courtroom; the governance of climate change; intellectual property and access to medicines; law and psychiatry; technological disasters and citizenship. This module is likely to be of interest to those students who particularly enjoyed LW592 Public Law II.

      LW624 - Labour Law

      
      
       This module is concerned with contemporary labour law. It combines legal analysis and the transmission of practical legal skills with a highly contextual and interdisciplinary understanding of the labour law and regulatory debates around labour regulation. To that end, workshops will feature extended discussion on key aspects of contemporary labour legislation using scholarly texts.. Students will also study key legal aspects of the modern employment relationship including the contract of employment, statutory employment protection provisions (for example unfair dismissal and redundancy protection), anti-discrimination legislation and provisions for reconciling work and family life (e.g. pregnancy protection and parental leave). The module will also explore selected aspects of collective labour law including the role and status of trade unions, the legal regulation of collective bargaining and/or the regulation of industrial conflict. The module seeks to combine a detailed  knowledge of fundamental key aspects of labour law with the development of broader conceptual, critical and evaluative perspectives on workplace regulation.

      LW626 - Appropriate Dispute Resolution: Theory and   Practice

      
      
       In recent times, alternative forms of dispute resolution (ADR) have been widely recognised as possessing the potential to limit some of the damage caused by civil disputes. Therefore, a lawyers skill-set ideally should include a well-developed ability to analyse, manage and resolve disputes both within and outside the usual setting of the courtroom. Thus, the modules primary aim is to introduce students to the legal and regulatory issues surrounding methods of dispute resolution aside from litigation. Specifically, the module focuses on the practical factors relevant to selecting appropriate dispute resolution in distinct circumstances, including, for example, the employment and family law arenas.  Students will be provided with the resources to acquire a detailed theoretical and practical understanding of the contextual constraints associated with the use of different forms of dispute resolution and will be encouraged to develop their ability to evaluate the effectiveness of particular interventions, especially when used as an adjunct to court proceedings. The module tracks historic and current developments in relation the use of ADR, highlighting how government policy and courts appear, increasingly, to sanction failure to use ADR. This may well enhance students opportunities to hone career-advancing expertise in the field.

      LW596 - Gender, Sexuality and Law

      
      
       The media is full of gender controversies: theres same-sex marriage (or not) in California, violence against women pretty well everywhere, and a whopping 17% gender pay gap in the UK. What do you think about these issues? How do you think the law should respond? This module focuses on how law interacts with gender and sexuality. It examines, and encourages you to discuss, the interconnections between law, policy, gender, and sexuality. We will start by focusing on key concepts in feminist and queer legal theory, such as heteronormativity (the dominance of heterosexual family and social structures).  We will then relate these theories to current dilemmas: same-sex marriage; transgender rights; gay refugees; diverse family formations. Finally, we tackle the really big questions. Should we use the law to change the law? Are rights really any use? What is neo-liberalism and how does this relate to gender?

      LW507 - Critical Legal Theory

      
      
       Are you interested in critical approaches to law? Critical Legal Theory can help! This module introduces you to major concepts, questions and perspectives that are important for a critical engagement with the problem of law in contemporary life. The modules first aim is to build your vocabulary of critical legal concepts, which will deepen your engagement with law and legal problems. What does it mean to be critical? How can law aim for justice? Is law still authoritative? What qualifies as a legal text in contemporary society? How can we use understandings of sovereignty, judgment or the nature of government to critically analyse contemporary law? In the second term, we will apply these critical legal perspectives to a range of contemporary problems and situations. Examples might include biotechnology, facebook and social media, theoretical questions in governance and regulation, political protest, films and other popular cultural forms, human rights, social equality, terrorism and counter-terrorism, torture, the casualized workforce, and the plight of the refugee. Contemporary critical legal theory comes in many varieties and draws on many disciplines, and this module introduces you to a range of major approaches. Students will be able to focus their research essay on any substantive or theoretical area.

      LW520 - Company Law and Capitalism

      
      
       This module seeks not only to familiarise students with the basic concepts and structure of modern British company law, but also to provide them with a critical understanding of the nature and dynamics of modern capitalism and of the historical development of industrial organisation and the emergence of company law within it. In addition to a selection on modern company law, therefore, the module also traces the rise of the joint stock company in the nineteenth century and the emergence of company law in its wake. It moves on to trace the twentieth century rise of the modern multidivisional, multinational company and its impact on company law. In this context, it also considers the nature of the share and of shareholding, and the role of the Stock Market, and explores contemporary debates about corporate governance. Key aspects will include exploring the contractual relations between, on the one hand, the company and its agents and on the other hand, third parties who deal with the company, tracing the evolutionary changes from the Common Law to the modern predominantly statutory framework. It will also deal with aspects of corporate management and control, including directors duties, shareholders rights and the increasingly important issues pertaining to market abuse and how the law seeks to deal with such practices. Students are encouraged to familiarise themselves with current issues in the commercial world by reading the financial pages of the newspapers, as reference will frequently be made to current events to facilitate the learning process. The module will address a range of inter-related questions: How well suited is modern company law to the regulation of the large modern corporation? What do shareholders do? What does the Stock Market do? In whose interests are modern corporations run?  In whose interest should they be run? How do companies contract and what are the relationships between the organs of the company?

      LW522 - Comparative Law

      
      
       In the current context of globalization, postcolonialism and transnationalism, not to mention the Europeanization of laws, every law student in the UK will almost inevitably encounter foreign law in the course of his or her professional life. For one thing, the legislator shows itself more and more open to the influence of foreign legal ideas in the legislative process. Also, appellate judges increasingly refer to foreign law in the course of their opinions. Further, private parties often enter into legal arrangements, such as contracts or wills, presenting an international dimension. In sum, nowadays, foreign law is everywhere and cannot be circumvented. This module intends to provide law students with the necessary intellectual equipment allowing them to approach any foreign law (not only European laws) in a meaningful way. In particular, the module will heighten students sensitization to the specificity of foreign legal cultures and encourage them to reflect in depth upon the possibilities and limits of cross-border interaction in the law. Another feature of this module will be a critical introduction to hermeneutics, deconstruction and translation studies with specific reference being made to law as these lines of thought are most relevant for comparatists. Throughout the course, concrete examples will be developed from a range of different national laws. No prior knowledge of foreign law or of a foreign language is required.
