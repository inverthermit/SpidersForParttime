      HI426 - Making History: Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module has two aims: 1) to contribute towards equipping the students with the necessary practical and intellectual skills for them to think and write as historians at an undergraduate level; 2) to encourage them to think reflectively and critically about the nature of the historical discipline, its epistemological claims, and why we, as historians, do what we do in the way we do it. This will be achieved through four blocks of seminars and lectures. These will cover: The practice of history, introducing history at university level at both a practical and conceptual level. Historical methodology. This will cover the development of university history in the nineteenth century and how this differed from the study and writing of history that had gone before. It will also consider the impact of the Social Sciences on the historical profession during the twentieth century. The varieties of history. This will examine some of the major themes and approaches, such as Marxism or nationalism, in modern historical scholarship. Beyond history. The final block will consider the linguistic turn and new ways of studying and writing history in the twenty-first century.A fifth component, concentrated in the first three or four weeks of the module, will provide training in core, practical skills (library and bibliographic skills, IT skills and the use of MyFolio and PDP). 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CO320 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to object-oriented software development.  Software pervades many aspects of most professional fields and sciences, and an understanding of the development of software applications is useful as a basis for many disciplines. This module covers the development of simple software systems. Students will gain an understanding of the software development process, and learn to design and implement applications in a popular object-oriented programming language.  Fundamentals of classes and objects are introduced, and key features of class descriptions:   constructors, methods and fields.  Method implementation through assignment, selection control structures, iterative control structures and other statements is introduced.  Collection objects are also covered and the availability of library classes as building blocks.  Throughout the course, the quality of class design and the need for a professional approach to software development is emphasized

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

       14. A synopsis of the curriculumThis module aims to provide students with an understanding of the fundamental behaviour and components (hardware and software) of a typical computer system, and how they collaborate to manage resources and provide services. The module has two strands: Hardware Architecture and Operating Systems and Networks, which form around 35% and 65% of the material respectively. Both strands contain material which is of general interest to computer users; quite apart from their academic value, they will be useful to anyone using any modern computer system.Hardware ArchitectureData representation: Bits, bytes and words. Numeric and non-numeric data. Number representation.Computer architecture: Fundamental building blocks (logic gates, flip-flops, counters, registers). The fetch/execute cycle. Instruction sets and types.Data storage: Memory hierarchies and associated technologies. Physical and virtual memory.Operating Systems and NetworksOperating systems principles. Abstractions. Processes and resources. Security. Application Program Interfaces.Device interfaces: Handshaking, buffering, programmed and interrupt-driven i/o. Direct Memory Access.File Systems: Physical structure. File and directory organisation, structure and contents. Naming hierarchies and access. Backup.Background and history of networking and the Internet.Networks and protocols: LANs and WANs, layered protocol design. The TCP/IP protocol stack; theory and practice. Connection-oriented and connectionless communication. Unicast, multicast and broadcast. Naming and addressing. Application protocols; worked examples: SMTP, HTTP).

      HI397 - Cinema and Society, 1930 - 1960

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with an introduction to the ways in which historians use film as evidence.  It draws on a wide range of films, and stresses that they are to be understood in the context of the societies that produced them.  The films themselves reflect the ways in which the national cinemas of Britain, Europe and America portrayed the world around them.  The module will question the extent to which cinema, the most potent method of mass communication during this period, influenced hearts and minds by looking at films that were commercially successful and popular.  In this way, students will be introduced to the use of non-literary sources as historical documents, will be taught how to interpret them and become aware of the importance of contextualising evidence within a wider framework.Topics to be covered:Britain and the Great War: The Battle of the Somme; Soviet cinema: Battleship Potemkin; America in Depression: Grapes of Wrath; Britain at War: In Which We Serve; America at War: Bataan; Germany at War: Titanic; The McCarthy Era: On the Waterfront

      HI431 - The Renaissance in the British Isles, 1400-1600

      
      
       English history is traditionally divided along dynastic lines and the divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period is usually dated to 1485. As Sellar and Yeatman observed The reign of Henry VII marks the end of the Middle Ages. Yet scholars of English literature, drama and culture have long been used to looking past political events and dynastic change to chart longer-term developments. This module introduces students to the years 1400-1600 as a cohesive period in English history that saw a transformation in political, literary, intellectual and religious culture. Moreover, in European terms the years from 1400 to 1600 witnessed the rise to cultural hegemony of the studia humanitatis, the discovery of the New World, and the religious upheavals of the European Reformation. This module looks at the major political events of these years  the Lancastrian Revolution, the Wars of the Roses, the Henrician Reformation, the Mid-Tudor Crisis, and the problems of female monarchy during the reign of Elizabeth I  in the context of longer term developments in the cultural, intellectual and social history of England. Students will be introduced to literary texts including both poetry and drama, material culture, and the built environment, alongside more traditional historical sources (such as chronicles, administrative records and correspondence) as sources for the historian of pre-modern England.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI432 - 1450 - 1600: The Age of Reformation

      
      
       This module will provide a survey of the major events, themes and historiographical debates in early modern history from the Renaissance to religious wars of the early seventeenth century. This period in European history witnessed the cultural and social upheaval of the Reformation, the advent of print and the intellectual changes associated with Humanism, the formation of recognisably modern nation states, and the beginnings of Europes troubled engagement with the wider world. . As with the complementary module on later European history (c.1600-1750) the lectures and seminars will be arranged around six key areas:  1) religion 2) intellectual and scholarly life 3) economy 4) society 5) politics and war and 6) culture. These themes will be approached through the examination of national histories, specific events, and historiographical controversies. The topics covered will reflect the research and teaching interests of the School of Historys four permanent early modernists and prepare students for early modern modules taken at I and H level. Students will be encouraged to take this module along with a similar module in the Spring term which will cover the period from c.1600 to c.1750.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI434 - Introduction to the History of Science

      
      
       Science has arguably been the greatest force for cultural change in the last 500 years.  Scientists have changed the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and have equipped us with technologies that enable us to fly in the sky and shoot neutrinos under the ground.  They have taught us that our observations can shift the nature of physics, yet that we are nothing more than jumped-up apes.  This module visits some of the most important events and developments since the so-called scientific revolution (c. 1700) in order to give a representative view of the history of science.  It also introduces key themes that have been pursued by historians science that collectively call into question some key assumptions about what science is really like.

      HI438 - Vikings: the European Project, 750-1066

      
      
       Vikings, in the popular imagination, are commonly perceived as horn-helmeted, blood-thirsty pirates who killed and pillaged their way across Europe in the Middle Ages with their blood-stained axes. In reality, Vikings did much more than that. They changed the existing early-medieval political order for good; they contributed a great deal to the international trade, economy and urbanisation of different parts of Europe; and they explored and settled the uncharted territories of the North Atlantic, specifically the Scottish Isles, Iceland, Greenland, and as far as 'Vinland' (parts of Newfoundland), becoming the first Europeans to reach and temporarily settle in the North American continent; and they were perhaps the most engaging story-tellers of their time. By the time the Norse settled down and ceased raiding in the second half of the eleventh century, they had fundamentally altered the political, religious, economic and military history of much of the known world. This course will attempt to separate fact from fiction by critically reading and analysing primary source documents alongside archaeological, linguistic and place-name evidence, and thereby uncover the real history that lies behind the well-known stories of the Viking World. In addition, the students will be introduced to the major historiographical debates related to the Viking Age.

      HI353 - Britain and the Second World War: The Home Front

      
      
       War has often been seen as a catalyst for change. This module will examine how far this was true of politics, society, culture and the economy in Britain in the Second World War. The module will draw on a wide range of primary sources: Parliamentary debates, contemporary writings, including those of George Orwell and J B Priestley, cartoons, diaries, and personal memoirs. In order to increase familiarity with primary sources students will complete a compulsory document question as part of their Coursework. By the end of the module students should be able to discuss with authority the varying interpretations of the impact of the war. They will also have experienced the different approaches of political, social, cultural and economic historians, and this should provide a basis for choice of modules in Stage 2.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI366 - Britain in the Age of Industrialisation 1700-1830

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with an historical analysis of the classic phase of British industrialisation, traditionally known as the Industrial Revolution.  Historians nowadays emphasise the gradual nature of industrial transformation in Britain, and the period considered here is sufficiently long to encompass several key issues in economic history: the transformation of the rural sector, the role of international trade in development, the origins and dynamics of industrial growth and innovation, the rise of a consumer society, the process of urbanisation, and the social costs of industrialisation.  The module will provide a grounding in historical concepts appropriate to the social sciences, and students will acquire a familiarity with historical statistics.
