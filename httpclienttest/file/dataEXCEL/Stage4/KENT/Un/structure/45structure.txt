 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE588 - Advanced Social Anthropology 1: Power and Economy

      
      
       The module is a cross-cultural analysis of economic and political institutions, and the ways in which they transform over time. Throughout the term, we draw upon a range of ethnographic research and social theory, to investigate the political and conceptual questions raised by the study of power and economy. The module engages with the development and key debates of political and economic anthropology, and explores how people experience, and acquire power over social and economic resources. Students are asked to develop perspectives on the course material that are theoretically informed and empirically grounded, and to apply them to the political and economic questions of everyday life. The module covers the following topics: the relationship between power and authority; key concepts and theoretical debates in economic anthropology; sharing and egalitarianism; gift exchange; sexual inequality; violence; the nation state; money; social class; work; commodification; financialisation. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE589 - Advanced Social Anthropology II: Religion &  Cosmological Imagination

      
      
       This module is focused on a diverse range of approaches deployed by anthropologists to the study of religion, and belief and symbolic systems. It introduces a range of an-thropological insights to the ongoing transformations of religious traditions and belief systems vis-&agrave;-vis colonial encounters, post-colonial settings, as well as globalisation. The aim of the module is to familiarize students with the complex interactions between lived religious practice, religious traditions, and the ways in which these are intertwined with other domains of social life, politics, economics and ideology. The key topics covered in this module focus on ritual and sacrifice; witchcraft and sorcery; secularisation and fundamentalism; millennialism and conversion; cosmology and ideology; human and non-human relationships; modes of religiosity, rationality and belief; mediation and ethics. This module will develop students awareness of the strengths and limitations of anthropological insights compared to other disciplinary perspectives on religion such as theology, cognitive science or sociology.

      SE561 - Biology and Human Identity

      
      
       The module is designed as a bridging module between more biological elements of the BSc programme and the more socio-cultural anthropology courses students take as part of that programme. Being largely a broad survey of human evolutionary biology and identity, it will serve to introduce the more biological students to arguments and materials that will place their biological understanding within a broader framework of ideas about what makes people who and what they are and encourage them to explore the socio-cultural aspects of biological science. For the more socio-cultural BA students the module provides an opportunity to consolidate biological understanding from the Foundations of Biological Anthropology module and learn how to assess the assumptions and limitations of biology in the understanding of human behaviour. We will cover topics such as the human fossil record, human variation, what makes us human and ecological adaptation. By the end of the module the student should have knowledge of the basic principles of biological anthropology, an understanding of human identity, and be able to relate those ideas to wider concepts in biology. The student will be given an overview of the hominin fossil record and its interpretation, and receive in depth study of the different biological and social aspects that define us as human and the evolution of human life histories. The student will be introduced to the genetic and phenotypic variation of the modern human species, how humans have adapted to particular environments, and the importance diet played in human evolution. The student will also acquire some of the practical skills of data collection currently used by biological anthropologists. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE567 - Methodology in Anthropological Science

      
      
        This module will introduce students to anthropological research, as well as basic statistics and data handling, through a combination of seminars and practical classes on research methods, statistics, and instruction in the use of computer software to analyse data. The goal of this module is to provide students with an understanding of how anthropological research works, and how to design and undertake an independent research project. Topics covered include an introduction to parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques, how to use programmes such as SPSS, how to build and tests hypotheses, and anthropology-specific research methods.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE582 - Comparative Perspectives in Primate Biology

      
      
       This module will provide the fundamental theoretical and comparative perspective that lies at heart of biology, with a particular focus on the order Primates. Particular attention will be paid to the evolutionary history of the primates and comparative primate (skeletal) anatomy, both placed in an evolutionary ecological context (e.g. a consideration of dentition in relation to diet and feeding; post-cranial anatomy in relation to locomotion and phylogenetic trends). Extensive use of casts of primate skeletal material will provide hands-on experiential learning. The module will provide a detailed treatment of natural and sexual selection as key components of evolutionary theory that shape the adaptations of organisms, and the way adaptations are used to make sense of the diversity of organisms with particular reference to the primates. It complements, and is complemented by, SE580 Primate Behaviour and Ecology.

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE533 - Project in Anthropological Science

      
      
       In SE533 Project in Anthropological Science, students will be expected to conduct original research into some aspect of scientific anthropology and present their research findings in the form of a 10,000  12,000 word dissertation, and a moderated oral presentation. They will also have to submit a project participation file. For the project they can collect and analyse their own data, analyse previously published data in an original manner, or combine the two approaches. In most cases the research will include collecting/analysing quantitative data. Students will be assigned an individual supervisor who will advise them on their choice of topic and your research strategy. The participation file will document the progress of the research and related research training. There is no word limit, as exact content will depend on the project topic. At a minimum it should include: A diary of the research, a log of the meetings with the supervisor, notes from supervisions or from consultations with the supervisory team, notes from data collection and analysis, notes from wider reading, and any draft methods of data collection (questionnaires etc.).

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SE593 - Evolution of Human Diversity

      
      
       The nature and extent of the biological diversity observed amongst human populations has been at the heart of anthropological enquiry for centuries. This module will provide an introduction into human phenotypic and genetic diversity across the globe.  Biological anthropologists today use a variety of analytical models and techniques drawn from population and quantitative genetics in order to analyse human biological diversity in a meaningful way. Students will be introduced to these such that the complexities of evolutionary ecological theory are readily understood. Students will learn the extent to which humans have adapted to various environmental conditions as well as understanding the effects of recent demographic changes and population expansions. Students will also learn how human adaptations affect ecological patterns in the species that interact with human populations. This facilitates a direct comparison with other ecological patterns while placing human diversity in broad comparative perspective. This also serves as a platform for critically evaluating claims of human ecological or evolutionary uniqueness.

      SE541 - Palaeoanthropology

      
      
        Hominins  the array of species of which ours is the only living representative  provide the clues to our own origins. In this module, the methods and evidence used to reconstruct their biology and (especially) behaviour are discussed. This module will provide students with an advanced knowledge of human evolution, as well as techniques used in the examination of behaviour and cognition in fossil hominins. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of stone tools and artefacts, which provide the most abundant source of evidence for hominin behaviour during the Plio-Pleistocene. Issues of social transmission and cultural evolution within the hominin lineage will also be examined. By the end of the module, students will be able to assess the importance of an evolutionary perspective to the human sciences.

      SE580 - Primate Behaviour and Ecology

      
      
       This module introduces students to the discipline of behavioural ecology, with particular reference to non-human primates. The module looks at the patterns and principles that can be generalised from the variation in behaviour and ecology across primate species. Set within an evolutionary behavioural-ecological framework, this module combines established findings with the latest research. It emphasises the importance of direct observations of primate behaviour and the use of theoretical models with which to make sense of these data. The module covers social and reproductive behaviour within primate groups, the nature and evolution of primate societies, and cognition and communication, as well as interactions between primates and their environments: primates as foragers, predators and prey. The module will make particular use of multi-media technology to allow students to see and hear primates in their natural habitats.

      SE565 - Sex Evolution and Human Nature

      
      
       Much of the material presented in this course forms part of the relatively new academic discipline of evolutionary psychology/anthropology. The goal of this course is to discover and understand the principles of evolutionary psychology and other complementary paradigms. The module explores human behaviour (primarily human sexual behaviours) from an evolutionary perspective. Topics covered are reproductive and mating strategies, parenting behaviour, kinship, cooperation, survival, status striving, jealously, and aggression. The course will provide an excellent understanding of the deeply biological nature of human behaviour, and develop skills in critical thinking. Students will be encouraged to bring relevant questions and observations to seminars and time will be allocated to deal with them.Lecture and seminar topics will include: The origins of human nature and evolutionary anthropology Why does sex exist, what does it mean to be a particular sex, and why dont men breast-feed?  What aspects of our personalities are determined by our biological need to reproduce? Why are human beings so intelligent? Viewing humans as a species of ape. What can we learn by studying chimpanzees about ourselves  and our ancestors?  Human mating strategies. Male and female long and short term strategies. The essence of beauty.  Do men and women differ in their natures? If so, are these differences genetic? Adultery. Whats love got to do with it?  Why do humans have a concealed (not advertised) ovulation?  Why is there a menopause?  Sexual conflict and jealousy  Why do we make friends, and what are they good for?

      SE566 - Human Osteology

      
      
       The study of the human skeletal system is basic to the discipline of biological anthropology. This module will examine the fundamentals of human osteology. Students will learn to identify and analyse human bone and evaluate and interpret major research in biological anthropology that has as its basis the analysis of bone.Seminar/practical topics will include:A detailed consideration of the basic properties of bone growth, development, and function in the human body.An examination of all major skeletal structures and the morphological features associated with them. The focus will be on the function of these structures within the body as well as the identification of fragmentary remnants of them in a forensic or archaeological context.Major techniques used in biological anthropology to analyse human bone, such as estimation of age at death, estimation of biological sex and stature.Critical evaluation of major research studies in biological anthropology involving analysis of human bone.Consideration of ethical issues in the collection and curation of human bone.

      SE573 - Ethnicity and Nationalism

      
      
       Ethnicity and nationalism are matters of contemporary urgency (as we are daily reminded by the media), but while the meanings of these terms are taken for granted, what actually constitutes ethnicity and nationalism, and how they have been historically constituted, is neither clear nor self-evident. This module begins with a consideration of the major theories of nationalism and ethnicity, and then moves on to a series of case studies taken from various societies around the world., and then moves on to examine a number of other important conceptsindigeneity, race, hybridity, authenticity, invention of tradition, multiculturalism, globalizationthat can help us appreciate the complexity and dynamics of ethnic identities. The general aim of the module is to enable and encourage students to think critically beyond established, homogenous and static ethnic categories.

      SE575 - Medicinal Plants: Home Remedy, Pharmaceutical, Illicit Drug

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ethnopharmacology, a multidisciplinary field of study that employs chemistry, ecology, biology, pharmacology and anthropology to evaluate and understand the use of plants (and other substances) in non-western medical systems.  While  students will be introduced to all of the disciplines involved in ethnopharmacological research, this module will have a heavy anthropological focus.  Lecture and reading materials will address questions related to the actions of natural products in the human body, the ecological and evolutionary basis of medicinal plants use, the epistemology of non-western medical systems, the efficacy of medicinal plants and the development of pharmaceuticals based on traditional medicines.  Topics discussed in class will provide ideas and models for student   research projects. This module should appeal to students with interests in anthropology  and/or medical care/research.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

      SE592 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies

      
      
       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

      SE569 - Palaeopathology

      
      
       Some diseases leave a characteristic signature on the human skeleton after death, which can be retained in the burial environment.  Palaeopathology is the study of these diseases in human skeletons from an archaeological context to infer aspects of life in the past, such as childhood growth, as well as adult diet, activity, health, social interaction (caring, contact), and conflict.The purpose of this module is to provide theoretical knowledge about the causes and manifestations of skeletal disease, and practical experience identifying and diagnosing palaeopathology.  The relationship between skeletal growth and developmental disturbances are considered.  Disease, activity, and diet are discussed.  Skeletal responses to specific and non-specific infections, as well as neoplastic and traumatic events, are explored.

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      SE585 - From the Raw to the Cooked: The Anthropology of Eating

      
      
       Students will learn about the evolution and significance of food production, especially in relation to globalisation, identity and health.  The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development.  it will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation.  Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings.  We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporarary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

      DI503 - Evolutionary Genetics and Conservation

      
      
       Genetics forms the basis of the diversity of life on earth, and is fundamental to biodiversity, speciation, evolutionary ecology, and has become recognized to be vital to the successful restoration of endangered species. An understanding of the evolutionary processes that foster biodiversity and genetic diversity is essential for modern conservation biologists, across timescales ranging from a few generations to millions of years. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of genetic processes and evolutionary mechanisms within the context of conservation.

      SE547 - South East Asian Societies

      
      
       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      SE549 - The Anthropology of Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

      SE550 - The Anthropology of Gender

      
      
       This module explores the central historical and contemporary debates in the anthropology of gender, including: the search for universal principles underlying gender inequality (such as nature/culture and domestic/public), relationships between gender, sex, and sexuality, how gender articulates with other indices of difference such as race, class and nation, gendered perspectives on power, the interaction of agency and structure in the production of femininities and masculinities, gender and technology, gender and the state, and gendered modernities.  A key concern of the module will be to understand, discuss and debate how the primarily qualitative methods of ethnographic research can inform and further these debates.  The module will first review the historiography of theoretical developments in the anthropology of gender and feminist anthropology, then move on to consider key classic and contemporary ethnographies to explore how they contribute to our ability to analyse and understand gender. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE554 - Visual Anthropology Theory

      
      
       This module is a general introduction to visual anthropology. It includes treatment of cross-cultural cognition and symbolic analysis, the social history of still photography and film relating to ethnographic subjects, the study of national and regional cinematic traditions (outside Europe and America), the comparative ethnography of television and broader consideration of issues of social representation and political ideology in visual imagery, combining empirical ethnographic analysis of these issues with the alternative (complementary) contributions of scholars of visual imagery from a literary and humanistic tradition of interpretation. It includes a short practical introduction to different visual media, but extended practical experience is available only through the project modules.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE555 - Project in Visual Anthropology

      
      
       Within the Anthropology degree programme this module represents an optional component of Part II studies, namely the practical study of visual representations. It assumes that students will be taking SE554 Visual Anthropology Theory as a prerequisite. Its distinctiveness relative to the other module is that it focuses principally on the exploration of theoretical issues, through the development of an ethnographic project, focussed on either photography or video and delivered as multimedia. The module requires the making a visual project (a photographic essay, a short ethnographic film) with practical instruction in developing, editing and mounting procedures.Students will be introduced to basic techniques of visual production and presentation. The practical component of the course cannot attempt to provide qualified instruction in professional photographic or video production expertise, and we are narrowly constrained by the limited equipment and technical support available. The visual project is intended to give practical experience of general techniques of visual communication that should critically inform understanding of more theoretical topics dealt with in the module. Techniques of camera use, instruction (theoretical and practical) on research methods, practice and demonstration of visual presentation will all be taught sequentially, and linked to students practical experience in formulating and producing their projects.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE556 - Social Sciences in the Classroom

      
      
       This module is a one-term placement opportunity that allows students to teach aspects of their degree subject in a local school. Launched to coincide with Kents 50th anniversary, this module highlights the longstanding excellence of social science research and teaching at the University, and the important role the institution has in contributing to the local community The module will begin with (formative) training sessions (2x3hours) in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the sections of the national curriculum that are degree specific, the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of the specific degree subject. In the Spring term the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a local school. Generally, they will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of their subject area within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project ( in consultation with the teacher and with the local module convener. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE557 - Primate Communication

      
      
       The diversity and complexity of primate sociality is reflected in the diversity and complexity of their communication strategies. This module will build on SE580 (Primate Behaviour & Ecology) by examining the ways in which primates communicate with one another through olfactory, tactile, visual, and acoustic signals. We will address fundamental questions in animal communication including: Is it appropriate to characterize such communication in terms of information transfer? How does communication evolve? What maintains signal honesty, and under what conditions can deceptive communication can evolve? The module will cover the physical and biological bases of signal production and perception. We will explore the extent to which studies of primate communication can provide a window into their minds. Finally, we will delve into the question of the relevance of primate communication for understanding the evolution of human language. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE594 - Anthropology and Development

      
      
       Primarily intended to offer a critical analysis of the concept of development, particularly as it is used to talk about economic and social change in the developing world, the module shows how anthropological knowledge and understanding can illuminate 'development issues' such as rural poverty, environmental degradation, international aid and humanitarian assistance, climate change and the globalization of trade.  Topics discussed include the role of anthropology in development practice, by examining some of the methods being used to either study or participate in current development projects, whether at local, national or international levels of intervention.

      SE595 - Social Computing

      
      
       In this module you will learn how people are using social computing resources, how anthropologists and others understand these activities, how to access and deploy these resources yourself, and how to leverage your participation to better understand social and cultural processes that are underway in social computing contexts.In Social Computing we describe and analyse how people use and adapt new technologies to form and navigate cultural and social contexts, create and spread knowledge and undertake action emerging from computer-enhanced capabilities.  Capabilities include the internet (including so call Web 2.0), clouds, augmented reality, robotics and virtual devices, wearable computers and sensors and artificial intelligence.We begin by looking at the major theoretical paradigms and methods that have guided research on these in anthropology and related disciplines.  In the remainder of the module we examine case studies of social computing based on different capabilities, using a took-kit that supports the creation and analysis of social computing capabilities and developing group and individual contributions to an on-going collective module project that will contribute to the Social Computing context.Topics considered include the creative commons of open source, Web 2.0 and resource clouds, social networks, organisational change, reputation, social, lgel and ethical issues, mobile and ubiquitous computing and argmented reality.  Topics discussed in class will provide ideas and models for student research projects.

      SE601 - European Societies

      
      
       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE604 - Human Behavioural Ecology

      
      
       This course covers the field of human behavioural ecology with a nearly exclusive focus on small scale foraging societies. In this sense it is a survey of hunter-gatherer behavioural diversity viewed through the lens of adaptation by natural selection. Scientists in many fields often place a scientific premium on the study of hunter-gatherer (forager) populations because humans lived as hunter-gatherers for the majority (nearly all) of their time on the planet. Economically speaking we study hunter-gatherer diversity because we encounter a diversity of traits and conditions that cannot be found by studying the ecologically unusual environments occupied by humans reliant on post-industrial technologies. Thus, we often focus on hunter-gatherer behavioural variation to understand the origins of human uniqueness and the evolutionary roots of many human behaviours in general. The only way to evaluate when and if claims based on forager diversity are true is to critically examine both the motivating theory and the data. This course accomplishes that task while also familiarizing students with a) human behavioural ecology (HBE) as a field, (HBE is the dominant evolutionary perspective in anthropology today) and b) hunter-gatherer ecology across the globe.  The module provides an in-depth overview of the field of human behavioural ecology with a focus on foraging populations from around the globe. Additionally, the study of hunter-gatherers is placed into the development and history of anthropology as a discipline. Ecological and evolutionary models are presented and explained. A variety of key areas of human behaviour are examined: subsistence, mobility, sharing, territoriality, the division of labour, social organization, political organization, and the pre-history of hunter-gatherers.

      SE605 - Hormones and Behaviour

      
      
       If behaviour has been shaped by natural selection, then those behaviours must have some biological basis. This module explores the extent to which hormonal mechanisms provide such a biological explanation of behaviour in humans and our primate cousins. Students will learn the basics of the endocrine system, and consider both how hormones affect behaviour and how behaviour may affect hormones. This module will examine the role that hormones play in the differentiation of behaviours between females and males, as well as the evidence that sexual, parental, aggressive, and affiliative behaviours are influenced by hormones. Students will thus complete this module with a greater appreciation of the hormonal underpinnings of the complex sociality that characterizes humans and other primates.

      SE752 - Anthropology of Creativity

      
      
       This module critically surveys anthropological approaches to creativity and creative expressionselected from research on creativity itself, and on the anthropology of art and literature (both oral and written).  We explore three fields of creative practice as they relate to contemporary anthropology. 1) We review classic approaches to the anthropology of art, in both non-Western and Western contexts. We assess recent breakthroughs which challenge the borders between artistic and ethnographic discourse, exploring how the ethnographic encounter can be rethought via dialogue with contemporary artists. 2) We review the anthropology of literature, and assess both pioneering forms of literary expression in the work of anthropologists, and the output of anthropological practitioners of literary fiction and poetry. 3) We examine how anthropology itself can be conceptualised as the creative expression of an encounter with others, lived experience, and the unknown, and explore the implications for anthropological modes of representation (including public anthropology). Students have the option to develop a creative project during the module that builds on this training, and can submit both academic and practice-led creative anthropological research as their assessment.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
