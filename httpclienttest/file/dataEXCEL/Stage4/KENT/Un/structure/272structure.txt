 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SO334 - Modern Culture

      
      
       This module introduces students to discussions and debates surrounding modern culture. It looks at why culture has always been such a contested sphere and has a decisive impact on society at large. Students will look at culture in the widest sense, ranging from the arts to the banalities of everyday life in our consumer society; at how culture has expressed and organised the way people think and live from the days of 'protestantism' to those of post-punk. Books, magazines, radio, TV, movies, cartoons, fashion, graffiti, the cult of celebrity, youth subcultures and pop music will be used to understand class, history, sexuality, colonialism, revolution, conflict and globalisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO335 - Contemporary Culture and Media

      
      
       Contemporary culture is 'now-time' culture, but when did 'now begin - and, will it be over before the course starts? This module focuses on analysing contemporary culture and media and aims to demonstrate the range of possible interpretations that mediated culture can be open to. It raises questions about how culture can be viewed from aesthetic, political, ethical and economic perspectives. What is culture really for? Is it product or a process? Who owns it? Is it for fun or is it deadly serious? In order to think through contemporary issues such as gender relations, sexuality, multiculturalism and otherness, and what they might imply about our changing perceptions of space, place, and belonging, we'll be taking a case study approach to a range of cultural products and objects, media and institutions, and post-modern practices of communication. This module aims to understand the transformation of culture and media and everyday life we are living through and the way it changes who we are.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO408 - Sociological Theory: The Classics

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the major issues and controversies surrounding the definition, development and teaching of classical social theory. It introduces students to the key problems that have set the agendas for sociological inquiry as well as the main concepts and theoretical traditions that have shaped sociological thought.   A considerable debate surrounds the meaning of classical social theory and what should be associated with this term.  For some, classical social theory refers to ideas developed by a generation of thinkers whose works belong to a particular period of our cultural/intellectual history (usually dated c.1880- c.1920). Others understand this as a label for canonical texts that define the project and enterprise of sociology. For many, it simply means the works of Karl Marx, &Eacute;mile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel (the so-called founding fathers of the discipline). Classical sociology has also been identified as a critical tradition of placing society in question so as individuals may be better equipped to understand how their personal troubles are the product of determining socio-economic structures and processes.  Each of these approaches to understanding classical social theory will be explored and analysed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO336 - Sociology of Everyday Life

      
      
       Sociology offers insight into how society works. To do this, we question and look behind the common sense view of everything in the social world. This course looks at a range of important and topical aspects of society and explains how we can make better sense of them by thinking sociologically. The aim is to introduce students to the wide range of topics which comprise contemporary Sociology and indicate how social circumstances shape and influence our lives. Why do powerful differences and inequalities between men and women persist even though both are now formally equal? Why, in a world that is safer and healthier than ever before, do we witness so much concern about risks such as to our health, children and security. These are type of questions we will begin to answer. The course is suitable both for those who have studied sociology at A level, and those who have not. There is a considerable emphasis on interactive discussion, through weekly seminar groups.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO337 - Fundamentals of Sociology

      
      
       This course provides grounding in the basic history and assumptions of sociological thinking and research, and how they apply to key aspects of our society. Topics are less from everyday experience than in the Sociology of Everyday Life course, focusing on more abstract topics such as the state and globalization. Students will also be encouraged to consider competing perspectives on these topics and how they might be assessed. There will be a lecture and seminar each week and students will be encouraged to engage in informed discussion and debate. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

It may also be taken as a wild option. In each term, the module examines theories and analyses central to the development of the study of culture within two distinct trajectories.In the Autumn term, the module introduces and applies ideas in critical, cultural and communications theory to debates and issues surrounding media and popular culture, focusing on such themes as cultural elitism, power and control, the formation of identities, the politics of representation, and the cultural circuit of production and consumption. It investigates the relationship between the development of contemporary society and societal values and the changing technological basis of mediated culture. In the Spring term, the module combines theoretical and methodological approaches to examine how our understandings of the past, present and future are mediated and remediated in social, cultural and political contexts. Over the course of the term, it will debate and critically explore the relationship between lived experience, memory and the imagination, the politics of cultural heritage and how social myths are developed and used in the construction of cultural identity. It will question how we think about what constitutes cultural history, how we envisage the future and our role in both.

The development of environmental protest, environmental movements and Green parties are central concerns, but we shall also consider the greening of established political parties and political agenda.  Is it realistic to expect the development of a global environmental movement adequate to the task of tackling global environmental problems. The approach is broadly comparative and examples will be taken from Europe (east and west), North America, Australasia and south-east Asia.

      SO657 - Digital Culture

      
      
       This module will examine the impact of digital technology on our social and cultural lives. It will concentrate on how the Internet in particular has challenged some of our more traditional notions of identity and self, the body, relationships, community, privacy, politics, friendship, war and crime, economics, among others. Lectures will show how some of the basic components of culture such as notions of identity, space, the body, community, and even the very notion of what it is to be human, have been complicated by the rise of virtuality and cyberspace. We will also examine these issues through case study phenomena unique to digital culture, currently including gaming, music, cybersex and social networking.

      SO736 - Sociology of Religion

      
      
       This module covers key issues and debates in the sociology of religion in order to interrogate the significance of religious practice and belief in the modern world. After an introductory lecture, the module is organised into two connected parts. Firstly, it explores classical statements on the sources, meaning and fate of religion in modernity by examining the writings of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel, and using their analyses to interrogate current events (e.g. prosperity Pentecostalism, the rise of the supernatural in culture through such media as the Harry Potter novels, and violent responses to transgressions of what religions consider to be sacred). The emphasis here is on developing in students the knowledge and skills necessary to appreciate and engage critically with the significance of religion for the development of sociology, and with key statements about the modern fate of religion in and beyond the West. Second, the module explores core issues concerned with and associated with the secularisation debate. Here, we look not only at conventional arguments concerning secularisation and de-secularisation, but also at the significance of the return of the sacred in society, civil religion, the material experience of religion, and the manner in which religious identities and habits are developed in the contemporary world. This enables us to develop new perspectives on the viability of religion in current times.

      SO737 - Literature and Society

      
      
       This course will provide students with a sociological understanding of the changing and central importance of literature (in its myriad forms, both fiction and non-fiction) for contemporary society, including the emergence of specific genres which reflect the changing demographics and social and political concerns of Britain, as well as some other societies. These genres and concerns have been articulated through a diverse array of protagonists in contemporary literature, varying in terms of gender, sexuality, religion, and class. Not only do we talk of chick lit, but we also read and consume books about vampires and zombies as symbolic vehicles of social otherness. Contemporary literature enables us to examine the ways in which texts address the past, changing social norms, the process of self-discovery and revelation, and the changing boundaries of private and public, in increasingly diverse societies. This module will also emphasize the importance of literature in fostering social reflection, through the ways in which important moral and ethical concerns are often addressed in a variety of genres. While most of the texts are relatively recent, this module also includes a small number of older works of ethnography.

      SO659 - Risk and Society

      
      
       The course is concerned with the relatively new ideas of living in a risk society which theoretically capture the heightened sensitivity within Western societies to the numerous risks which shape our lives. The course will explore basic concepts of risk, hazard and probability and how risk is managed and communicated. Topics will include risk and globalization, and risk and the media. Developments will be examined through key examples such as mad cow disease and genetically modified frankenfoods. The course will suggest that heightened perception of risk is here to stay, and is leading to a reorganisation of society in important areas.

      SO668 - The Sociology of Work

      
      
       Work and economic life is one of the central themes of sociology. Work allows us to think about class, gender, race and issues of identity. Work defines how people live their lives and is a major constituting factor in identity formation. In recent years work has changed enormously with the rise of globalisation, of deindustrialisation and the ending of old certainties which used to underpin working lives. This module examines how sociology and sociologists have looked at the issue of work in the past as well as in contemporary societies. It charts the theoretical background to the assumptions sociologists make about work as well as the methods they use to investigate work and employment. The module will focus on issues industrialisation, deindustrialisation, notions of career and identity and places and spaces of work. A major part of this module is the discussion of innovative ways of looking at work including through visual methods and approaches, and in addition it will draw on material from the arts and humanities.

      SO676 - Cultures of Embodiment

      
      
       Images of trim, taut and terrific bodies surround us in contemporary consumer culture. They look down on us from billboards, are increasingly central to advertisers attempts to sell us clothes, cosmetics, cars, and other products, and pervade reality television programmes based on diet, exercise and extreme makeovers. These trends have occurred at the same time that science, technology, genetic engineering and medicine have achieved unprecedented levels of control over the body: there are now few parts of the body which cannot be remoulded, supplemented or transplanted in one way or another. In this course we explore how culture represents and shapes bodies, and also examine how embodied subjects are themselves able to act on and influence the culture in which they live. We will seek to understand the relationship between the body and self-identity, embodiment and inequalities, and will explore various theories of the body. In doing this we range far and wide by looking at such issues as cyberbodies, religion, food, film, transgenderism, sport, music, work and sleep. Embodiment is the enduring theme of  this course, though, and we will explore its many dimensions via a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, and by asking and addressing a range of questions such as How and why has the body become increasingly commodified?, Why has the body become increasingly central to so many peoples sense of self-identity?, If we live in a culture that has been able to intervene in the sizes, shapes and contents of the body like never before, have people have become less sure about what is natural about the body, and about how we should care for and treat our bodily selves?.

      SO679 - Research Dissertation

      
      
       This module aims to enable students to design and conduct their own piece of research. This can be primary research where students collect and analyse their own data, or it can be library based, where students research existing literature or re-analyse data collected by others. The research can be about a particular policy or policy area, social problem, social development, or matter of sociological interest. The dissertation will usually be set out as a series of chapters. In order to assist students with designing and writing a dissertation a supervisor  a member of staff in SSPSSR - will have an initial meeting with students (during the summer term of Year 2 where possible) and then during the Autumn and Spring terms students will have at least six formal dissertation sessions with their supervisor. These may be held individually or with other students. In addition there will be two lectures by the module convenor which will also support students progress.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP502 - Fiction and Power

      
      
        This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran. Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish). This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP518 - The Book and the Film: Adaptation and Interpretation

      
      
       This module seeks to explore how novels and plays are adapted and interpreted for the screen. We shall be looking at how certain texts lend themselves to multiple reshaping such as Laclos 'Dangerous Liasions' and Henry James 'The Turn of the Screw', both of which have been adapted for the screen more than once. We shall also analyse lesser known works that have gone on to become feature films, such as Arthur Schnitzlers short work Dream Story, filmed as 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Adaptations directed by widely recognised filmmakers such as De Sica,  Max Ophuls, Kubrick and Pier Paolo Pasolini will also be examined with a view to eliciting and understanding their particular approach to, and filmic vision of, written texts.

      CP534 - Modern Arabic Literature and the Middle East

      
      
       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

      CP611 - Postmodernism

      
      
       The module will begin by studying some of the major early postmodern writers such as Charles Olson and Alain Robbe-Grillet. This will be followed by a comparative analysis of second-generation postmodern literature in both Europe and the United States, including writers such as Italo Calvino and Thomas Pynchon. The module will also reference postmodern texts in other media such as film (the Free Cinema movement) and the visual arts (most notably, Pop Art). Almost from its inception, postmodernism has been subject to theorization and to a highly charged debate over its status as either a radical and liberating movement or as a mere symptom of late capitalism and a media-saturated culture in which the medium is the message. Students will study some of the key theoretical documents on the postmodern, including extracts from the work of Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard.

      HA671 - Beauty in Theory, Culture and Contemporary Art

      
      
       After decades of neglect, beauty has made a controversial return both in contemporary art and as a concept in contemporary aesthetics, art theory and criticism.  The module examines the issues raised by this recent resurgence of beauty. Looking at the concept of beauty, the role of beauty in culture and society, and its presence in contemporary art and theory, the module explores the issues that make the return of beauty such a controversial topic.  The module will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines to examine the place of beauty: classic philosophical texts (Plato, Kant, Lessing), contemporary philosophy (Levinson, Gaut, Nehamas, Walton, Zangwill, Hepburn), cognitive and evolutionary science (McMahon, Etcoff), art criticism (Danto, Hickey, Beckley), art history (Gombrich, Clark), sociology and cultural theory (Wolff). In addition, a range of traditional, modern and contemporary artists will be discussed, including Goya, Warhol, Orlan, Duchamp, Picasso, Goldsworthy, Rubens, Ofili, Poussin, Serrano, Metsys, Velazquez, Motherwell, Rembrandt, Mangold.

      HA676 - Transatlantic Dialogues: British and Modern Art c.1900-1970

      
      
       The development of British and American art reveals patterns of affinity, divergence and mutual interplay, against a backdrop of the wider of an international Modernism centred to a large degree on Paris. This module examines such themes as the following: the currency and influence of realist, abstract, and surrealist aesthetics in the first decades of the 20th century(focussing on figures such as Walter Sickert, Edward Hopper, Ben Nicholson, Stuart Davis, Henry Moore); the impact of the Second World War (and of Picassos Guernica as an exemplary artistic response to conditions of war); the emergence after the war of painterly abstraction (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Peter Lanyon), alongside new approaches to expressive figuration (Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon); the development of constructed sculpture (David Smith, Anthony Caro) and post-painterly abstraction (Frank Stella, Bridget Riley) on either side of 1960; parallel manifestations of Pop, Minimalist, Conceptual and Land Art (Richard Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Richard Long, Robert Smithson); attitudes to photography as an artistic and documentary medium (Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus).

       This module explores a range of neo-avant-garde and post-war art practice from the 1960s through to the contemporary; from the Minimalism & Pop Art of the 1960s through to the YBAs and after. It will introduce and discuss some of the key artistic figures within the period, exploring their practice, critical contexts and legacy. Taking a thematic approach to one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse art historical periods, we will consider a range of genres  painting, sculpture, installation, performance and land art  exploring how artists have re-defined and developed their practice in the cultural period following Modernism. Artists exampled will typically include Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gilbert & George, Eva Hesse, Jenny Saville, Yinka Shonibare, Gerhard Richter and Rachel Whiteread.

      HA680 - Classicism and Baroque

      
      
       The organising principle of this course is derived from Giovanni Pietro Belloris Vite de Pittori et Architetti Moderni (1672). In selecting a small group of twelve exemplary artists for his history, Bellori was employing artistic biography to expound his theory of art based on the Idea. This charted a middle way between naturalism and mannerism, through which the imitation of nature informed by the principles of antique art produced works which surpassed nature. Among the artists included in Belloris corpus are Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Michelangelo da Caravaggio, and the non-Italian artists Nicolas Poussin, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. Several of the leading artists of the period were excluded from the canon, notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Bellori presumably had these artists in mind when he condemned his contemporaries who juggle madly with corners, gaps and twirling lines, discompose bases, capitals and columns with stucco nonsense, trivial ornament and disproportions. The aesthetic and theoretical judgements which informed Belloris exclusion of artists from his book can be glimpsed in this quote. In the art historical literature on this period such critical judgements are explained in terms of the dichotomy between classicism and the baroque (although these were not terms used in the period). Following Riegl and W&ouml;lfflin the baroque has been defined in opposition to classic art, as an art of becoming rather than of being, addressing the emotions, rather than the intellect, through a tactile evocation of appearances. Often the theoretical writing of the period has been characterised as reacting against, or irrelevant to, what was truly innovative about the work of baroque artists like Bernini and Borromini. These generalisations will be tested through close study of the works of the artists named above, and also by exploring how they might relate to contemporary artistic debates, such as those at the French Acad&eacute;mie Royale about the relative merits of Poussin and Rubens, or between Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona in Rome over the number of figures which should be included in a narrative painting. In addition to exploring the acute interest in stylistic criticism during the seventeenth century, the study of individual artists will also involve consideration of the role played by their patrons, especially their ideological, religious and antiquarian concerns. Although the course will progress by studying individual artists in roughly chronological order, the treatment will be thematic rather than monographic. Lectures at the beginning and end of the course will introduce and summarise the more general historiographical themes; the remaining lectures will be on artists including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Bernini, Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, Poussin, Rubens and Van Dyck.

      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory.

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

       The module provides an introduction to social and political issues raised by food and its provision, exploring how sociologists, social anthropologists and policy analysts have addressed this area. The module examines the role of food within the household and beyond, exploring the ways in which food and food practices make manifest social categorisations such as gender, age, ethnicity and religion. Using the examples of vegetarianism and religion, it examines the way food is entwined with symbolic and moral categorisations. The module as also addresses the political and policy issues raised by food, exploring government involvement in the area of ingestion, drawing parallels between food, alcohol and tobacco. In doing so it addresses the political issues raised by the large corporate interests of the food industry, and the role of the market in shaping provision. It addresses questions of public health, dietary adequacy and the future of the welfare state through sessions on schools meals and food banks.

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP646 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP650 - Decadence in Fin-de-Siecle Europe

      
      
       The module explores the development of decadence in late nineteenth-century Europe as an artistic response, a philosophic expression and a social critique. Taking the work of Charles Baudelaire and the failed revolutions of 1848 as its starting-points, the module examines decadence as both a symptom of political and artistic frustration and as a psychological investigation of what Max Weber would later term the disenchantment of the world. Key themes will include the role of the artist, nature versus artifice, fantasy and desire, sexuality, social morality versus personal freedom, and death. The module will not only explore decadence in terms of different literary genres (fiction, drama, poetry) but also in the visual arts of the period.

It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP653 - Comparative Literature and English & Linguistics in the Classroom

      
      
       This module will provide the opportunity for third year undergraduates to gain valuable transferable skills by giving them some first-hand teaching experience in a secondary school classroom. Each student will spend half a day each week for one term in a local school under the supervision of a specific teacher, who will act as a mentor, and decide the tasks and responsibilities of the student. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other.They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progressed, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school. This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      TH570 - I:Religion and Film

      
      
       The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and evaluate the range of models by which film and religion may be employed as conversation partners and to provide them with the tools necessary for exploring critical links between theology/religious studies and the medium of film. The course will begin with an examination of the methodological, conceptual and disciplinary issues that arise before exploring in critical depth the historical relationship between religion and film, with specific reference to the reception (ranging from prohibition to utilisation) of film by different religious groups. There will be a focus on particular categories of film and categories and models of religious and theological understanding, allowing students taking this module to develop the critical skills helpful for film interpretation and for exploring possible religious and theological approaches to film criticism.Film clips will be used within lectures and will be discussed and unpacked in the seminars.

      SO605 - Crime , Media and Culture

      
      
       The module provides students with an understanding of the contested cultural meanings underpinning crime.  Too often criminology is satisfied taking definitions of criminality at face value, when really it means very different things to different people and in different contexts.  The module examines how media representations propagate particular perceptions of crime, criminality and justice.  It goes on to consider the manner in which those who 'offend' experience and interpret their own behaviour, which may be focused on the attainment of excitement or indeed on attaining their own conception of justice.  The module explores these contradictions in a world where crime, control and the media saturate everyday life.  In doing so it considers a diverse range of concepts; youth culture, hedonism, hate crime, risk taking, moral panics, the image, emotionality and consumerism.  We examine the nature of a late-modern society where criminality inspires great fear and resentment, whilst at the same time it provides imagery which is harnessed to produce entertainment and sell a range of consumer goods.  Students will become familiar with cutting edge research and theory in the fields of Cultural Criminology, Visual Criminology, and Media and Crime, placing issues such as music, photography, street gangs, extreme sports, newspapers and nights on the town in new and exciting contexts.

      PL610 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art?  What is an artwork?  Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common?  If so, what are they?  Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided?  Do avant-garde works count as art?  Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention?  What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally?  These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course.  After that we will consider other issues and questions.  What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities?  What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way?  Why is rock music such a part of our lives?  Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery?  What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art?  Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters?  Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code?  And what on earth is the point of public art?  What is public art?

      HA586 - Photographic History & Aesthetics 1: Realism in Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module begins with an exploration of the history and pre-history of the invention of various photographic technologies, along with the early uses to which these technologies were put. Particular attention is given to the early cultural and intellectual impact of the invention of photography, especially its use as a recorder of the appearance. After considering an example of the kind of predominate modernist art theory that made photography problematic as a realist art form, the emergence and development of realist photographic theory in various guises is explored through a number of key authors and seminal texts. Having explored a wide variety of realist theories, the difficulties of reconciling a realist photographic practice with traditional accounts of aesthetic significance is discussed along with possible responses. The module closes by considering the rise of digital imaging and the end of the realist aesthetic among fine art photographers, as well as exploring the implications of this new technology for our understanding of what a photograph is.

      HA595 - Visual Arts Writing

      
      
        This module will be for final year students who are interested in gaining employment within the art and heritage press and/or marketing sectors. It will complement the vocational and work-based emphasis of the existing HPA Internship module (HA579). It will comprise a series of taught seminars supplemented by visiting speakers from the art/trade press, and from across the marketing and heritage sectors [6-8 speakers per module delivery]. NB: This is not an NCTJ validated course and makes no pretence at providing the full competencies of such. What it will provide will be an introduction to a range of press and related activities within the visual arts and heritage sectors. It will be of relevance for those students considering the possibility of working within these areas and for those who wish to explore some of the practicalities of researching and submitting copy and undertaking related promotional and marketing activities. The module will start by considering examples from the range of trade, specialist and institutionally affiliated publications which service the art and heritage markets. It will consider their target readerships, commissioning practices and particular subject and industry angles. Publications such as The Antiques Trade Gazette, The Art Newspaper, Tate Magazine and Art Monthly will be among those evaluated. Seminars will introduce some of the basic principles of trade writing: standing up and presenting copy proposals for commissioning; adapting copy to differing house-styles; preparing for and undertaking interviews for writing briefs and useful sources of information for generating ideas for prospective writing projects. Seminars will also consider the arts-related promotional work typically undertaken by press and marketing departments within auction houses, public art galleries and within government-funded organisations such as the British Council, and those local and regional authorities with heritage related responsibilities and sections (Canterbury City Council, Medway Unitary Authority etc).

      HA661 - Art & Film

      
      
       Art & Film will explore the longstanding relationship between these visual media and the different ways this relationship has been conceived and evolved over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first century. Though special emphasis will be placed on the post second world war period, which has seen artists and filmmakers increasingly exploring intermediality, the course will begin by examining the field of visuality out of which cinema emerged and will look at the shared visual traditions that existed between them within the rapidly changing visual culture of the nineteenth century. The development of cinema and photography will be examined in relation to new technologies for the production of visual knowledge and imagery and the new modes of spectating that accompanied their inception. The influence of traditions of painting on early cinema will be studied in relation to shared codes of gesture, composition and tableaux, but the course will also assess the early influence of cinema on painting. In this context the development of serialism in art in the late 1880s will receive special attention.The course will then look at both early experimental film within the context of modernist and avant garde practice in the first part of the twentieth century and Hollywood filmmakers in the 1920s and 30s, whose films continued to make overt references to Academic and non-Academic traditions of painting. The module will examine the impact of theories of modernism on the evolution of film and art before moving on to consider the way artists and filmmakers have engaged with the issue of intermediality in the post-1945 era.In the context of studying particular artists, filmmakers and movements in the visual arts, students will be engaging with a range of thematic and aesthetic issues that cut across the boundaries of different visual media, exploring questions about perspective, colour and light, movement, montage, temporality, narrative and resistance to narrative, and the transposition of one medium into another, (e.g. the portrayal of painting, photography, drawings, prints and sculpture in film and other media). During the course students will deepen their understanding of the impact of critical theories on art and culture on the production and reception of works of visual art by being introduced to key critical texts. Within this context the course will also look at institutional frameworks and settings (e.g. the museum, the gallery, the cinema etc.) in which works of art and films are produced and viewed, examining how these settings inflect the experience of those works.

      HA663 - Abstraction & Construction in the 20th Century

      
      
       The development of Abstract Art is one of the distinctive features of the 20th Century. This module examines the roots of the aspiration to allow the object to evaporate like smoke in European and Russian art, and the establishment of Constructivism as a central force in artistic practice in 20th century art. The spiritual, philosophical and social ideas (and ideals) of key artists (such as Malevich, Tatlin, Kandinsky, Mondrian and Klee) are considered in relation to their artistic practice; the work and ideas of American abstractionists are addressed through an examination of legendary figures such as Rothko, Pollock and Stella; discussion of Nicholson, Moore, and de Sta&euml;l, among others, enables us to think about the response of the British and European artworld to the challenges and opportunities of abstraction and construction. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists make use of this radical tradition. Throughout the module we will raise the question of how to make, think about and respond to an art without objects.

       The development of British and American art reveals patterns of affinity, divergence and mutual interplay, against a backdrop of the wider of an international Modernism centred to a large degree on Paris. This module examines such themes as the following: the currency and influence of realist, abstract, and surrealist aesthetics in the first decades of the 20th century(focussing on figures such as Walter Sickert, Edward Hopper, Ben Nicholson, Stuart Davis, Henry Moore); the impact of the Second World War (and of Picassos Guernica as an exemplary artistic response to conditions of war); the emergence after the war of painterly abstraction (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Peter Lanyon), alongside new approaches to expressive figuration (Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon); the development of constructed sculpture (David Smith, Anthony Caro) and post-painterly abstraction (Frank Stella, Bridget Riley) on either side of 1960; parallel manifestations of Pop, Minimalist, Conceptual and Land Art (Richard Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Richard Long, Robert Smithson); attitudes to photography as an artistic and documentary medium (Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus).

      HA504 - Classicism and Baroque

      
      
       The organising principle of this course is derived from Giovanni Pietro Belloris Vite de Pittori et Architetti Moderni (1672). In selecting a small group of twelve exemplary artists for his history, Bellori was employing artistic biography to expound his theory of art based on the Idea. This charted a middle way between naturalism and mannerism, through which the imitation of nature informed by the principles of antique art produced works which surpassed nature. Among the artists included in Belloris corpus are Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Michelangelo da Caravaggio, and the non-Italian artists Nicolas Poussin, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. Several of the leading artists of the period were excluded from the canon, notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Bellori presumably had these artists in mind when he condemned his contemporaries who juggle madly with corners, gaps and twirling lines, discompose bases, capitals and columns with stucco nonsense, trivial ornament and disproportions. The aesthetic and theoretical judgements which informed Belloris exclusion of artists from his book can be glimpsed in this quote. In the art historical literature on this period such critical judgements are explained in terms of the dichotomy between classicism and the baroque (although these were not terms used in the period). Following Riegl and W&ouml;lfflin the baroque has been defined in opposition to classic art, as an art of becoming rather than of being, addressing the emotions, rather than the intellect, through a tactile evocation of appearances. Often the theoretical writing of the period has been characterised as reacting against, or irrelevant to, what was truly innovative about the work of baroque artists like Bernini and Borromini. These generalisations will be tested through close study of the works of the artists named above, and also by exploring how they might relate to contemporary artistic debates, such as those at the French Acad&eacute;mie Royale about the relative merits of Poussin and Rubens, or between Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona in Rome over the number of figures which should be included in a narrative painting. In addition to exploring the acute interest in stylistic criticism during the seventeenth century, the study of individual artists will also involve consideration of the role played by their patrons, especially their ideological, religious and antiquarian concerns. Although the course will progress by studying individual artists in roughly chronological order, the treatment will be thematic rather than monographic. Lectures at the beginning and end of the course will introduce and summarise the more general historiographical themes; the remaining lectures will be on artists including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Bernini, Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, Poussin, Rubens and Van Dyck.

      HA507 - Reading the Image

      
      
       The module examines the development of the western tradition of the visual arts from the Renaissance to the late twentieth century, looking specifically at issues about the representation of time and space in painting and related arts.  The module begins with the invention of linear and atmospheric perspective in the Renaissance and looks at the development of these compositional techniques and the tradition of visual illusion they underpin in Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries.  The course looks at the theories of Alberti and Humanist writers and in particular the role played by perspective in advancing the narrative tradition of painting.  The module goes on the examine the critique of the Renaissance tradition in the later 19th Century and the breaking away from the tradition of perspective in modernist painting.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      FR593 - Paris: Myth and Reality in the 19th century

      
      
       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and interesting history.  In the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the nineteenth century (1830, 1848, 1870-71), the city played a key role in deciding the fate of the nation.  In the same period, it grew dramatically in size and emerged as a modern metropolis.  Widely divergent views were expressed as to the wholesomeness of city living; opinion differed equally violently among writers as to the benefits to be derived from the explosive growth of the city. The module will examine conditions of life in the real Paris of the 19th Century and in particular the radical and highly controversial changes to the face of the city brought about during the Second Empire under the direction of Baron Haussmann.  The main focus of the module, however, will be the images of the city as mediated in contemporary fiction (Balzac and Zola amongst others), poetry (Baudelaire) and painting (Manets vision of city life).

       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and exciting history. It played, for example, a key role during the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the 19th century. This module follows on from FR593  Paris: Myth and Reality I (which is NOT a prerequisite for FR594). It explores the different and evolving representations of Paris of the 20th century in the context of modernity and postmodernity. Although the main focus of the course will be literary, including poetry and fiction, there will also be examination of the changing landscape of the capital as mediated through film.

      HA575 - Beauty in Theory Culture & Contemporary Art

      
      
       After decades of neglect, beauty has made a controversial return both in contemporary art and as a concept in contemporary aesthetics, art theory and criticism. In very different ways, beauty can be seen in the work of artists as diverse as Vanessa Beecroft, Chris Ofili, Robert Mapplethorpe, Gary Hume and Jenny Saville, and it has been rehabilitated as a critical term in the writings of critics such as Dave Hickey and Arthur Danto.The module examines the issues raised by this recent resurgence of beauty. Looking at the concept of beauty, the roles of beauty in culture and society, and its presence in contemporary art and theory, the module explores the issues that make the return of beauty such a controversial topic. The module will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines to examine the place of beauty: classic philosophical texts (Plato,  Kant, Lessing), contemporary philosophy (Levinson, Gaut, Nehamas, Walton, Zangwill, Hepburn), cognitive and evolutionary science (McMahon, Etcoff), art criticism (Danto, Hickey, Beckley), art history (Gombrich, Clark), sociology and cultural theory (Wolff).  In addition, a range of traditional, modern and contemporary artists will be discussed, including Goya, Warhol, Orlan, Duchamp, Picasso, Goldsworthy, Rubens, Ofili, Poussin, Serrano, Metsys, Velazquez, Motherwell, Rembrandt, Mangold.

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

      CP658 - Nordic Literature and Film

      
      
       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      PL526 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art? What is an artwork? Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common? If so, what are they? Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided? Do avant-garde works count as art? Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention? What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally? These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course. After that we will consider other issues and questions. What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities? What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way? Why is rock music such a part of our lives? Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery? What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art? Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters? Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code? And what on earth is the point of public art? What is public art?

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
