      CB302 - Managers and Organisations

      
      
       The main strand of the lecture material will establish the foundations of organisational behaviour in the context of the historical development of ideas and theory.  The theories will be related to practical examples and thence students will be introduced to modern experience, practice and scholarship. Once the information of the foundation of organisational behaviour is established, at the next level, contemporary topics of management will be touched upon briefly.  This will provide students with basic knowledge related to modern management practices. The content of the module will, therefore, be based on the following topics: Scientific Management Human Relations School Bureaucracy Post Bureaucratic Organizations Contingency Approach Group and teams Motivation Power and authority Managing diversity

      EC302 - Introduction to Economics

      
      
       This module has been designed for students who need to study what is often described as a Principles of Economics course. Each economics topic is introduced assuming no previous knowledge of the subject. The lectures and related seminar programme explain the economic principles underlying the analysis of each topic and relate the concepts to the real world. In particular, many examples are taken from the real world to show how economic analysis and models can be used to understand the different parts of the economy and how policy has been used to intervene in the working of the economy. This module aims to introduce you to the basic principles of Economics, to the main ways in which economists think about problems and to the important current economic issues in the United Kingdom, the European Union and the world economy. The module is self-contained, so that if you do not study Economics further, you should have a basic understanding of economic methods and debates. It is also suitable as a basis for further modules that you may take in economics, either as part of an Economics degree or as part of another degree programme or as part of a future professional qualification.

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      MA552 - Analysis

      
      
       The concept of a limit is basic to Calculus and, unless this concept is defined precisely, uncertainties and paradoxes will creep into the subject. Based on the foundation of the real number system, this module develops the theory of convergence of sequences and series and the study of continuity and differentiability of functions. The notion of Riemann integration is also explored. The syllabus includes the following: Sequences and their convergence. The convergence of bounded increasing sequences. Series and their convergence: the comparison test, the ratio test, absolute and conditional convergence, the alternating series test.

      MA553 - Linear Algebra

      
      
       This module is a sequel to First Year Algebra. It considers the abstract theory of Linear spaces together with applications to matrix algebra and other areas of Mathematics (and its applications).  Since linear spaces are of fundamental importance in almost every area of mathematics the ideas and techniques discussed in this module lie at the heart of mathematics. Topics include: Elementary operations on matrices; Vector (alias Linear) spaces; linearly independent and spanning sets, bases, dimension, subspaces;  Linear Transformations; Matrix of a Linear transformation; Change of Basis, Similar Matrices and Applications; Determinant of an LT; Diagonalisation; Invariant subspaces and upper triangular forms; Bilinear forms, norms, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality;  Orthonormal systems; the Gram-Schmidt process;  Diagonalisation of real symmetric matrices by orthogonal matrices; Applications e.g. to Projection mappings and Least Squares Approximation.

      MA584 - Computational Mathematics

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide an introduction to the methods, tools and ideas of numerical computation. In applications mathematics frequently generates specific instances of standard problems for which there are no easily obtainable analytic solutions. Examples might be the task of determining the value of a particular integral, or of finding the roots of a certain non-linear equation. Methods are presented for solving such problems on a modern computer. Besides a description of the basic numerical procedure, each method is analysed in terms of when it best works, how it compares with alternative approaches, and the way it may be implemented on a computer. Numerical computations are almost invariably contaminated by errors, and an important concern throughout the module is to understand the source, propagation and magnitude of these errors.The syllabus will cover: Introduction to numerics; solutions of equations in one variable; interpolation and polynomial approximation; numerical differentiation; numerical integration; direct methods for solving linear systems; iterative techniques for solving linear systems.

      MA629 - Probability and Inference

      
      
       This module develops the techniques introduced in the first year probability and statistics modules, and lays the foundation for several third year statistics modules. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations.  The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module.  Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  All of these have been introduced in the first year statistics module.  The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation.  Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, etc.  Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables.  Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution.  Principles of statistical inference.  Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency).  Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments.  Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test.  Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.

      MA632 - Regression Models

      
      
       The aims of the module are to introduce the students to the theory and practice of regression, and associated linear model techniques. Quite often experimenters and researchers wish to express a response variable y as a function of some other (explanatory) variables. For example, y might be the yield of a chemical process and the explanatory variables might be temperature and pressure. Knowing the relationship would enable y to be predicted for particular values of temperature and pressure. In this module the method of deriving such a relationship will be that of least squares and the theoretical and practical aspects of this method will be covered in some detail. There will be opportunity for students to use computer programs.The module covers most of the following topics: definition of the linear model and regression, least squares estimates, sums of squares, expectations, properties of estimators, the ANOVA table, standard errors and confidence intervals for parameters, residuals, diagnostics, regression with two explanatory variables, matrix formulation of the model, multiple regression, extra sum of squares principle, use of MINITAB, model selection strategies, introduction to analysis of variance.

      MA588 - Mathematical Techniques and Differential Equations

      
      
       Most physically interesting problems are governed by ordinary, or partial differential equations.  It is examples of such equations that provide the motivation for the material covered in this module, and there is a strong emphasis on physical applications throughout. The aim of the module is to provide a firm grounding in mathematical methods: both for solving differential equations and, through the study of special functions and asymptotic analysis, to determine the properties of solutions. The module will provide invaluable to anybody who later takes third year options in asymptotics, numerical analysis or differential equations.The following topics will be covered: Ordinary differential equations: method of Frobenius, general linear second order differential equation. Special functions: Bessel, Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre and Chebyshev functions, orthogonal functions, gamma function, applications of special functions.  Partial differential equations; linear second order partial differential equations; Laplace equation, diffusion equation, wave equation, Schr&ouml;dingers equation; Method of separation of variables.

      MA565 - Groups and Rings

      
      
       Groups are sets with a single binary operation.  They arise as symmetry groups in contexts from puzzles like Rubiks cube to chemistry, where they help list molecules with a given number of atoms involved.  In contrast, rings have two binary operations, generalising the arithmetic of integer numbers. This part of algebra has many applications in electronic communication, in particular in coding theory and cryptography.

      MA501 - Statistics for Insurance

      
      
       This module covers aspects of Statistics which are particularly relevant to insurance. Some topics (such as risk theory and credibility theory) have been developed specifically for actuarial use. Other areas (such as Bayesian Statistics) have been developed in other contexts but now find applications in actuarial fields. Stochastic processes of events such as accidents, together with the financial flow of their payouts underpin much of the work.  Since the earliest games of chance, the probability of ruin has been a topic of interest.  Outline Syllabus includes: Decision Theory; Bayesian Statistics; Loss Distributions; Reinsurance; Credibility Theory; Empirical Bayes Credibility theory; Risk Models; Ruin Theory; Generalised Linear Models; Run-off Triangles.Marks on this module can count towards examption from the professional examination CT6 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

      AC508 - Principles of Finance

      
      
       This module is concerned with the principles which underlie the investment and financing decision making process. Before a rational decision can be made objectives need to be considered and models need to be built. Short-term decisions are dealt with first, together with relevant costs. One such cost is the time value of money. This leads to long term investment decisions which are examined using the economic theory of choice, first assuming perfect capital markets and certainty. These assumptions are then relaxed so that such problems as incorporating capital rationing and risk into the investment decision are fully considered. The module proceeds by looking at the financing decision. The financial system within which business organisations operate is examined, followed by the specific sources and costs of long and short-term capital, including the management of fixed and working capital.

      MA772 - Analysis of Variance

      
      
       This module will build on the material on linear-models covered in the module, MA632 Regression.   Analysis of variance is a fundamentally important method for the statistical analysis of data.  It is used widely in biological, medical, psychological, sociological and industrial research.  In analysing experimental data, the appropriate form of analysis of variance is determined by the design of the experiment, and we shall therefore discuss some aspects of experimental design in this module.  Lectures are supplemented by computing classes which explore the analysis of variance facilities of the statistical package R. Syllabus: One-way ANOVA (fixed effects model); alternative models; least squares estimation; expectations of mean squares; distributional results; ANOVA table; follow-up analysis; multiple comparisons; least significant difference; confidence intervals; contrasts; orthogonal polynomials; checking assumptions; residual plots; Bartletts test; transformations; one-way ANOVA (random effects model); types of experiment; experimental and observational units; treatment structure; randomisation; replication; blocking; the size of an experiment; two-way ANOVA; the randomised complete block design; two-way layout with interaction; the general linear model; matrix formulation; models of full rank; constraints; motivations for using least squares; properties of estimators; model partitions; extra sum of squares principle; orthogonality; multiple regression; polynomial regression; comparison of regression lines; analysis of covariance; balanced incomplete block designs; Latin square designs; Youden rectangles; factorial experiments; main effects and interactions

      MA549 - Discrete Mathematics

      
      
       Recently, with the rapid developments in IT, in particular in electronic communication systems, some quite surprising new applications have been found for Discrete Mathematics (as opposed to the Continuous Mathematics based on the calculus). Thus methods for the encoding of information in order to safeguard against eavesdropping or distortion by noise have involved using some basic results from modular arithmetic, polynomial algebra and the theory of finite fields. The module will provide a self-contained introduction to this general area and will cover most of the following topics:(a)   Modular arithmetic, polynomials and finite fields: Applications to orthogonal Latin squares, RSA public key ciphers, coin-tossing over a telephone, linear feedback shift registers and m-sequences.(b)   Error correcting codes: Binary block, linear and cyclic codes including repetition, parity-check, Hamming, simplex; Reed-Muller - BCH - Golay - and other codes; channel capacity; Maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, syndrome and algebraic decoding.

      MA567 - Topology

      
      
       This module is an introduction to point-set topology, a topic that is relevant to many other areas of mathematics. In it, students will be looking at the concept of topological spaces and related constructions. In an Euclidean space, an "open set" is defined as a (possibly infinite) union of open "epsilon-balls". A topological space generalises the notion of "open set" axiomatically, leading to some interesting and sometimes surprising geometric consequences. For example, we will encounter spaces where every sequence of points converges to every point in the space, see why for topologists a doughnut is the same as a coffee cup, and have a look at famous objects such as the Moebius strip or the Klein bottle.

      MA587 - Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

      
      
       Most differential equations which arise from physical systems can not be solved explicitly in closed form, and thus numerical solutions are an invaluable way to obtain information about the underlying physical system. The first half of the module is concerned with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several different numerical methods are introduced and error growth is studied. Both initial value and boundary value problems are investigated.  The second half of the module deals with the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The syllabus includes initial value problems for ODEs, Taylor methods, Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, error bounds and stability.  Boundary value problems for ODEs, shooting methods and finite difference schemes.  Partial Differential Equations, difference schemes, iterative methods, stability analysis and the method of lines.

      MA574 - Polynomials in Several Variables

      
      
       This module provides a rigorous foundation for the solution of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  In the 1890s, David Hilbert proved four ground-breaking theorems that prepared the way for Emmy Noether's famous foundational work in the 1920s on ring theory and ideals in abstract algebra.  This module will echo that historical progress, developing Hilbert's theorems and the essential canon of ring theory in the context of polynomial rings.  It will take a modern perspective on the subject, using the Groebner bases developed in the 1960s together with ideas of computer algebra pioneered in the 1980s. The syllabus will be: Multivariate polynomials, monomial orders, division algorithm, Groebner basis; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and its meaning and consequences for solving polynomials in several variables; Elimination theory and applications; Linear equations over systems of polynomials, syzygies, discussion of Hilbert's Syzygies Theorem, its proof and applications. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other applications.  Depending on time, these may include: invariants of group actions, linear PDEs, combinatorics and the Stanley-Reisner ring, and algebraic codes.

      MA883 - Bayesian Statistics

      
      
       The origins of Bayesian inference lie in Bayes' Theorem for density functions; the likelihood function and the prior distribution combine to provide a posterior distribution which reflects beliefs about an unknown parameter based on the data and prior beliefs. Statistical inference is determined solely by the posterior distribution. So, for example, an estimate of the parameter could be the mean value of the posterior distribution.This module will provide a full description of Bayesian analysis and cover popular models, such as the normal distribution. Initially, the flavour will be one of describing the Bayesian counterparts to well known classical procedures such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.Current methods for inference involving posterior distributions typically involve sampling strategies. That is, due to the complicated nature of some posterior distributions, analytic methods fail to provide meaningful summaries. Hence, sampling from the posterior has become popular. A full description of  sampling techniques, starting from rejection sampling, will be given. The syllabus will be:Conjugate models (prior and posterior belong to the same family of parametric models). Predictive distributions; Bayes estimates; Sampling density functions; Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings samplers; Winbugs; Bayesian regression and hierarchical models; Bayesian model choice; Decision theory; Objective priors; Exchangeability.

      MA858 - Computational Statistics

      
      
       The module starts with an introduction to a range of atypical data sets, drawn from areas such as ecology, biology, genetics and psychology.  Each of the examples can be described by a suitable stochastic model, making use of the known background to the data, and built on the axioms of probability theory. Fitting models to data is traditionally accomplished by the method of maximum likelihood, and typically this involves numerical optimisation. The labour involved here is only feasible using a computer, and integral to the module is the use of the MATLAB integrated computer package. The module also describes modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, and MATLAB is again very useful for illustrating these methods in operation. In supervised computer practical classes you will gain experience with running a range of computer programs for modern methods of statistical analysis.  Students completing this module will possess an enviable grasp of the utility and power of modern statistics for describing real-life situations.  During the module you will cover most of the following topics: Introduction and examples. Model fitting by maximum likelihood. Function optimisation. Basic likelihood tools. Simulation techniques. Fundamental features of modelling. The EM algorithm. Generalised linear models, generalised linear mixed models. Bayesian methods. Note that this module makes excellent use of a wide range of statistical, mathematical and computational techniques, and revises and integrates material from a number of other lecture courses.

      MA973 - Basic Differential Algebra

      
      
       Differential algebra is a relatively recent branch of algebra that exploits the analogies between systems of algebraic equations and nonlinear systems of (mainly ordinary) differential equations. The basic references are (1) and (2) below. The tools developed in differential algebra are useful for practical problem solving, but they must be used through computer algebra packages since computations can get very heavy. In this module, we will give special emphasis to the package  "DifferentialAlgebra" included in the Maple kernel. We will give a rigorous but example led introduction to the main ideas of computer algebra. The main applications to be discussed are the analysis of singularities and the simplification of nonlinear differential systems. As already indicated, the module will have a strong computational flavour: Students will explore concrete examples with the computer algebra system Maple, comparing hand computations with the results achieved by the full-blown algorithms and dispatching large computations to the package.

      MA888 - Stochastic Models in Ecology and Medicine

      
      
       Ecology: This part of the module deals with the analysis of data collected on wild animals. Particular attention will be given to estimating how long wild animals live, and also to estimating the sizes of mobile animal populations. Fitted probability models will allow the assessment of environmental changes, such as global warming. Complex models may contain too many parameters to be estimated, and procedures will be described for testing for this using symbolic computer packages. State-space models provide a unifying framework for many of the models considered. Both classical and Bayesian methods of inference will be used.Medicine: This part of the module also considers the estimation of surival, but in this case for human beings, with less data loss due to individuals leaving the study than in the ecological case. However, human data can be censored, and methods will be presented for graphically representing such data and fitting standard probability models. As is also true in ecology, covariates can play an important role, as will be discussed, in particular using the Cox proportional hazards model. Collected serially in time on the same individuals, covariates result in longitudinal data, such as blood pressure reading on individuals, and methods will be presented for analysing such data.The syllabus will be:Estimating abundance. Estimating survival. Using covariates; multi-state models; complex models; parameter redundancy; state-space modelling; Bayesian analysis.Human survival data with censoring; longitudinal data; The hazard and related functions; simple parametric models; repeated observations.

       This module explores the important roles that Statisticians play in planning how data are collected. Well-planned studies can help to ensure that key questions of interest can be addressed unambiguously and can improve the precision of the conclusions of the study.  The two main types of study considered are sample surveys and designed experiments. For sample surveys, we study different variations of random sampling, the use of auxiliary information and practical issues such as the importance of questionnaire design and the problem of non-response. For experimental design, we start with the general principles of randomization, replication and blocking and study a variety of common designs and their analysis. Next we introduce hierarchical designs and components of variance. The module concludes by considering some of the specific issues that arise in the design of clinical trials, which are of great importance in medical and pharmaceutical applications.The Syllabus will be Sampling: Simple random sampling. Sampling for proportions and percentages. Estimation of sample size. Stratified sampling. Systematic sampling. Ratio and regression estimates. Cluster sampling.

       The general topics of this module are Poisson algebras, their quantisations, and applications to combinatorics.Poisson algebras first appeared in the work of Sim&eacute;on-Denis Poisson two centuries ago when he was studying the three-body problem in celestial mechanics. Since then, Poisson algebras have been shown to be connected to many areas of mathematics and physics.  This module will provide a rigorous but example led introduction to the main ideas and notions of Poisson algebras and their quantisations. Specific applications will be to problems in combinatorics and to the study of totally positive matrices that are used in statistics, game theory, mathematical economics, mathematical biology....

      MA972 - Algebraic Curves in Nature

      
      
       In this module we will study plane algebraic curves and the way that they arise in applications to other parts of mathematics and physics. Examples include the use of elliptic functions to solve problems in mechanics (e.g. the pendulum, or Euler's equations for rigid body motion), spectral curves of separable Hamiltonian systems, and algebraic curves over finite fields that are used in cryptography. The geometrical properties of a curve are not altered by coordinate transformations, so it is important to identify quantities that are invariant under such transformations. For curves, the most basic invariant is the genus, which is most easily understood in terms of the topology of the associated Riemann surface: it counts the number of handles or holes. The case of genus zero (corresponding to the Riemann sphere) is well understood, but curves of genus one (also known as elliptic curves) lead to some of the most interesting and difficult problems in modern number theory.    Review of basic results from complex analysis and topology; Riemann surfaces and plane curves in complex affine and projective space;  The genus of a curve: degree-genus and Riemann-Hurwitz formulae; Genus one: elliptic curves and their group structure; elliptic functions and elliptic integrals, with applications;  Higher genus: functions, divisors and differentials on algebraic curves; Riemann-Roch theorem; example: hyperelliptic curves.

      MA549 - Discrete Mathematics

      
      
       Recently, with the rapid developments in IT, in particular in electronic communication systems, some quite surprising new applications have been found for Discrete Mathematics (as opposed to the Continuous Mathematics based on the calculus). Thus methods for the encoding of information in order to safeguard against eavesdropping or distortion by noise have involved using some basic results from modular arithmetic, polynomial algebra and the theory of finite fields. The module will provide a self-contained introduction to this general area and will cover most of the following topics:(a)   Modular arithmetic, polynomials and finite fields: Applications to orthogonal Latin squares, RSA public key ciphers, coin-tossing over a telephone, linear feedback shift registers and m-sequences.(b)   Error correcting codes: Binary block, linear and cyclic codes including repetition, parity-check, Hamming, simplex; Reed-Muller - BCH - Golay - and other codes; channel capacity; Maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, syndrome and algebraic decoding.

      MA567 - Topology

      
      
       This module is an introduction to point-set topology, a topic that is relevant to many other areas of mathematics. In it, students will be looking at the concept of topological spaces and related constructions. In an Euclidean space, an "open set" is defined as a (possibly infinite) union of open "epsilon-balls". A topological space generalises the notion of "open set" axiomatically, leading to some interesting and sometimes surprising geometric consequences. For example, we will encounter spaces where every sequence of points converges to every point in the space, see why for topologists a doughnut is the same as a coffee cup, and have a look at famous objects such as the Moebius strip or the Klein bottle.

      MA576 - Groups and Representations

      
      
       Groups arise naturally in many areas of mathematics as well as in chemistry and physics.  A concrete way to approach groups is by representing them as groups of matrices, in which explicit computations are easy.  This approach has been very fruitful in developing our understanding of groups over the last century.This module will provide a rigorous introduction to the main ideas and notions of groups and representations.  It will also have a strong computational strand: a large part of the module will be devoted to explicit computations of representations and character tables (a table of complex numbers associated to any finite group).The syllabus will be as follows:(a) Groups: basic structure and examples (matrix groups, permutations), group actions;(b) A concrete approach to groups via representations;(c) Character tables: theory and computations for small groups;(d) Simple groups.Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other topics.  Depending on time, these may include some of the following examples: Platonic solids, Sylow Theorems, invariants of group actions, combinatorics, groups and cryptography.

      MA577 - Elements of Abstract Analysis

      
      
       In this module we build on the key analytical concepts of sequences, series, limits,and continuity developed in any first course on Real Analysis, and place them in the more general context of metric spaces. In the first part of the course fundamental notions of metric spaces, such as compactness and completeness, are discussed. Metric space theory underpins much of modern anaylisis and its applications. In the second part of the course we use techniques and theorems from metric spaces to discuss elements of Hilbert space theory. The course emphasizes formal definitions and proofs, and aims to enable you to place your previous knowledge of anaylsis in a much wider context.The syllabus will be taken from the following topics:(1) Metric space theory.  Definitions and examples of metric spaces, normed spaces, inner-product spaces. Balls, boundedness, open and closed sets.  Convergence, Cauchy sequences, completeness, and equivalence of metrics.  Completion of a metric space, uniform convergence, and exchanging limits.   Incompleteness of the space of Riemann-integrable functions under Lp-norms, and an informal discussion of its completion, i.e., Lp-spaces. The space of continuous functions and supremum norm.   Limit points, closure, boundary, separability, density.  Banach contraction mapping theorem; applications to ODE theory (Picard's theorem), and/or integral equations.  Continuity in metric spaces, uniform continuity, and continuity of linear mappings.  Compactness, sequential compactness, Heine-Borel, Non-compactness of balls in infinite dimensional normed spaces.  The spaces of continuous functions C(X) on a compact metric space X, and the Weierstrass approximation theorem. (2) Basic Hilbert space theory. Definitions and examples of inner-product spaces, Hilbert spaces, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, parallelogram identity, l2 and L2([a,b]).  Orthogonal complements and orthogonal projections.   Orthonormal sets and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation.  Examples of orthogonal polynomials, e.g., Legendre polynomials and/or Chebyshev polynomials.  Complete orthonormal systems, Bessel's inequality, Parseval's theorem, and the Riesz-Fisher theorem. Trigonometric series and L2 convergence.

      MA587 - Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

      
      
       Most differential equations which arise from physical systems can not be solved explicitly in closed form, and thus numerical solutions are an invaluable way to obtain information about the underlying physical system. The first half of the module is concerned with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several different numerical methods are introduced and error growth is studied. Both initial value and boundary value problems are investigated.  The second half of the module deals with the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The syllabus includes initial value problems for ODEs, Taylor methods, Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, error bounds and stability.  Boundary value problems for ODEs, shooting methods and finite difference schemes.  Partial Differential Equations, difference schemes, iterative methods, stability analysis and the method of lines.

      MA568 - Orthogonal Polynomials and Special Functions

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the study of orthogonal polynomials and special functions.  They are essentially useful mathematical functions with remarkable properties and applications in mathematical physics and other branches of mathematics. Closely related to many branches of analysis, orthogonal polynomials and special functions are related to important problems in approximation theory of functions, the theory of differential, difference and integral equations, whilst having important applications to recent problems in quantum mechanics, mathematical statistics, combinatorics and number theory. The emphasis will be on developing an understanding of the structural, analytical and geometrical properties of orthogonal polynomials and special functions.

      MA574 - Polynomials in Several Variables

      
      
       This module provides a rigorous foundation for the solution of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  In the 1890s, David Hilbert proved four ground-breaking theorems that prepared the way for Emmy Noether's famous foundational work in the 1920s on ring theory and ideals in abstract algebra.  This module will echo that historical progress, developing Hilbert's theorems and the essential canon of ring theory in the context of polynomial rings.  It will take a modern perspective on the subject, using the Groebner bases developed in the 1960s together with ideas of computer algebra pioneered in the 1980s. The syllabus will be: Multivariate polynomials, monomial orders, division algorithm, Groebner basis; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and its meaning and consequences for solving polynomials in several variables; Elimination theory and applications; Linear equations over systems of polynomials, syzygies, discussion of Hilbert's Syzygies Theorem, its proof and applications. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other applications.  Depending on time, these may include: invariants of group actions, linear PDEs, combinatorics and the Stanley-Reisner ring, and algebraic codes.
