      EL561 - Image Analysis & Applications

      
      
       Intelligent processing is associated with information processing operations which are generally carried out reliably and efficiently by humans, but which may be much more challenging for computer-based processing systems.  This module will introduce and explore some important techniques and applications for automated intelligent processing.  Principally, it will explore the visual environment, which is so important in human activity and increasingly so in supporting computational processing platforms routinely encountered in the modern world.  The display, manipulation and efficient communication of images (embracing issues ranging from how to manipulate image data to provide an optimal visual experience, to the automatic extraction of information from images to understand their content) are key elements in the design and utilisation of many contemporary applications in digital media and in engineering.This module will introduce the basic techniques required for image processing and automated image analysis, and will include a introductory study of the use of so-called neural network processors for the analysis of images, especially in relation to problems of image recognition, since such architectures neatly bridge the areas of human and automated processing.  Similarly, the module will embrace important topics of increasing interest in the context of maintaining the security of systems and media, including particularly an introduction to the emerging field of biometrics (the automatic identification of individuals).  Biometrics provides a good domain within which the power of intelligent processing can be illustrated, both because the identification of individuals is a fundamental human capability, and is increasingly important in many media applications (especially in relation to system security), but also because this often relies directly on the effective processing of visual data and complex images.

      BI640 - Magnetic Resonance in Biosciences and Medicine

      
      
       Magnetic resonance (MR) and remained a fundamental scientific method for several decades since its conception in 1938 but in the last 25 years, it has been successfully applied within biosciences and medicine as both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This module is designed for students with an interest in the applications of NMR and MRI and our approach and will be taught by example using real-world data, current research papers and reviews to reveal the utility of these methods across biosciences and medicine.This course begins by providing a basic understanding of MR for NMR and MRI as they both utilise identical methodologies. This section introduces, in a pictographic manner, general concepts relevant to NMR and MRI approaches discussed later in the module such as the experimental optimization, quantitation of biomedical metabolites and the production of contrast and signal in MRI images. The remainder of the module is split equally between describing some of many the applications, advantages and limitations of NMR and MRI. The NMR section focuses on the biological uses of NMR with the main emphasis on medical applications toward cell and tissue metabolism. Metabolite NMR is especially interesting as it has recently emerged as an important technique to monitor and map molecular markers in the study of many disease and conditions. The MRI section discusses MRI equipment, theory of medical MRI imaging, vascular and cardiac MRI, following tissue and organ activity, metabolic MRI methods and functional MRI (fMRI). fMRI is the gold-standard method to study brain activity using blood flow and can be used to assess tumours, stroke, head and brain injury or diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease.The course is delivered through 22 lectures and two feedback sessions for coursework.
