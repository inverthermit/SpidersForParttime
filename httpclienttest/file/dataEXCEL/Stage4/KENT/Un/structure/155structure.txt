 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE561 - Biology and Human Identity

      
      
       The module is designed as a bridging module between more biological elements of the BSc programme and the more socio-cultural anthropology courses students take as part of that programme. Being largely a broad survey of human evolutionary biology and identity, it will serve to introduce the more biological students to arguments and materials that will place their biological understanding within a broader framework of ideas about what makes people who and what they are and encourage them to explore the socio-cultural aspects of biological science. For the more socio-cultural BA students the module provides an opportunity to consolidate biological understanding from the Foundations of Biological Anthropology module and learn how to assess the assumptions and limitations of biology in the understanding of human behaviour. We will cover topics such as the human fossil record, human variation, what makes us human and ecological adaptation. By the end of the module the student should have knowledge of the basic principles of biological anthropology, an understanding of human identity, and be able to relate those ideas to wider concepts in biology. The student will be given an overview of the hominin fossil record and its interpretation, and receive in depth study of the different biological and social aspects that define us as human and the evolution of human life histories. The student will be introduced to the genetic and phenotypic variation of the modern human species, how humans have adapted to particular environments, and the importance diet played in human evolution. The student will also acquire some of the practical skills of data collection currently used by biological anthropologists.

      SE567 - Methodology in Anthropological Science

      
      
        This module will introduce students to anthropological research, as well as basic statistics and data handling, through a combination of seminars and practical classes on research methods, statistics, and instruction in the use of computer software to analyse data. The goal of this module is to provide students with an understanding of how anthropological research works, and how to design and undertake an independent research project. Topics covered include an introduction to parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques, how to use programmes such as SPSS, how to build and tests hypotheses, and anthropology-specific research methods.

      SE582 - Comparative Perspectives in Primate Biology

      
      
       This module will provide the fundamental theoretical and comparative perspective that lies at heart of biology, with a particular focus on the order Primates. Particular attention will be paid to the evolutionary history of the primates and comparative primate (skeletal) anatomy, both placed in an evolutionary ecological context (e.g. a consideration of dentition in relation to diet and feeding; post-cranial anatomy in relation to locomotion and phylogenetic trends). Extensive use of casts of primate skeletal material will provide hands-on experiential learning. The module will provide a detailed treatment of natural and sexual selection as key components of evolutionary theory that shape the adaptations of organisms, and the way adaptations are used to make sense of the diversity of organisms with particular reference to the primates. It complements, and is complemented by, SE580 Primate Behaviour and Ecology.

      SE533 - Project in Anthropological Science

      
      
       In SE533 Project in Anthropological Science, students will be expected to conduct original research into some aspect of scientific anthropology and present their research findings in the form of a 10,000  12,000 word dissertation, and a moderated oral presentation. They will also have to submit a project participation file. For the project they can collect and analyse their own data, analyse previously published data in an original manner, or combine the two approaches. In most cases the research will include collecting/analysing quantitative data. Students will be assigned an individual supervisor who will advise them on their choice of topic and your research strategy. The participation file will document the progress of the research and related research training. There is no word limit, as exact content will depend on the project topic. At a minimum it should include: A diary of the research, a log of the meetings with the supervisor, notes from supervisions or from consultations with the supervisory team, notes from data collection and analysis, notes from wider reading, and any draft methods of data collection (questionnaires etc.).

      SE541 - Palaeoanthropology

      
      
        Hominins  the array of species of which ours is the only living representative  provide the clues to our own origins. In this module, the methods and evidence used to reconstruct their biology and (especially) behaviour are discussed. This module will provide students with an advanced knowledge of human evolution, as well as techniques used in the examination of behaviour and cognition in fossil hominins. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of stone tools and artefacts, which provide the most abundant source of evidence for hominin behaviour during the Plio-Pleistocene. Issues of social transmission and cultural evolution within the hominin lineage will also be examined. By the end of the module, students will be able to assess the importance of an evolutionary perspective to the human sciences.

      SE549 - The Anthropology of Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

      SE556 - Social Sciences in the Classroom

      
      
       This module is a one-term placement opportunity that allows students to teach aspects of their degree subject in a local school. Launched to coincide with Kents 50th anniversary, this module highlights the longstanding excellence of social science research and teaching at the University, and the important role the institution has in contributing to the local community The module will begin with (formative) training sessions (2x3hours) in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the sections of the national curriculum that are degree specific, the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of the specific degree subject. In the Spring term the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a local school. Generally, they will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of their subject area within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project ( in consultation with the teacher and with the local module convener.

      SE557 - Primate Communication

      
      
       The diversity and complexity of primate sociality is reflected in the diversity and complexity of their communication strategies. This module will build on SE580 (Primate Behaviour & Ecology) by examining the ways in which primates communicate with one another through olfactory, tactile, visual, and acoustic signals. We will address fundamental questions in animal communication including: Is it appropriate to characterize such communication in terms of information transfer? How does communication evolve? What maintains signal honesty, and under what conditions can deceptive communication can evolve? The module will cover the physical and biological bases of signal production and perception. We will explore the extent to which studies of primate communication can provide a window into their minds. Finally, we will delve into the question of the relevance of primate communication for understanding the evolution of human language.

      SE569 - Palaeopathology

      
      
       Some diseases leave a characteristic signature on the human skeleton after death, which can be retained in the burial environment.  Palaeopathology is the study of these diseases in human skeletons from an archaeological context to infer aspects of life in the past, such as childhood growth, as well as adult diet, activity, health, social interaction (caring, contact), and conflict.The purpose of this module is to provide theoretical knowledge about the causes and manifestations of skeletal disease, and practical experience identifying and diagnosing palaeopathology.  The relationship between skeletal growth and developmental disturbances are considered.  Disease, activity, and diet are discussed.  Skeletal responses to specific and non-specific infections, as well as neoplastic and traumatic events, are explored.

      SE565 - Sex Evolution and Human Nature

      
      
       Much of the material presented in this course forms part of the relatively new academic discipline of evolutionary psychology/anthropology. The goal of this course is to discover and understand the principles of evolutionary psychology and other complementary paradigms. The module explores human behaviour (primarily human sexual behaviours) from an evolutionary perspective. Topics covered are reproductive and mating strategies, parenting behaviour, kinship, cooperation, survival, status striving, jealously, and aggression. The course will provide an excellent understanding of the deeply biological nature of human behaviour, and develop skills in critical thinking. Students will be encouraged to bring relevant questions and observations to seminars and time will be allocated to deal with them.Lecture and seminar topics will include: The origins of human nature and evolutionary anthropology Why does sex exist, what does it mean to be a particular sex, and why dont men breast-feed?  What aspects of our personalities are determined by our biological need to reproduce? Why are human beings so intelligent? Viewing humans as a species of ape. What can we learn by studying chimpanzees about ourselves  and our ancestors?  Human mating strategies. Male and female long and short term strategies. The essence of beauty.  Do men and women differ in their natures? If so, are these differences genetic? Adultery. Whats love got to do with it?  Why do humans have a concealed (not advertised) ovulation?  Why is there a menopause?  Sexual conflict and jealousy  Why do we make friends, and what are they good for?

      SE566 - Human Osteology

      
      
       The study of the human skeletal system is basic to the discipline of biological anthropology. This module will examine the fundamentals of human osteology. Students will learn to identify and analyse human bone and evaluate and interpret major research in biological anthropology that has as its basis the analysis of bone.Seminar/practical topics will include:A detailed consideration of the basic properties of bone growth, development, and function in the human body.An examination of all major skeletal structures and the morphological features associated with them. The focus will be on the function of these structures within the body as well as the identification of fragmentary remnants of them in a forensic or archaeological context.Major techniques used in biological anthropology to analyse human bone, such as estimation of age at death, estimation of biological sex and stature.Critical evaluation of major research studies in biological anthropology involving analysis of human bone.Consideration of ethical issues in the collection and curation of human bone.

      SE593 - Evolution of Human Diversity

      
      
       The nature and extent of the biological diversity observed amongst human populations has been at the heart of anthropological enquiry for centuries. This module will provide an introduction into human phenotypic and genetic diversity across the globe.  Biological anthropologists today use a variety of analytical models and techniques drawn from population and quantitative genetics in order to analyse human biological diversity in a meaningful way. Students will be introduced to these such that the complexities of evolutionary ecological theory are readily understood. Students will learn the extent to which humans have adapted to various environmental conditions as well as understanding the effects of recent demographic changes and population expansions. Students will also learn how human adaptations affect ecological patterns in the species that interact with human populations. This facilitates a direct comparison with other ecological patterns while placing human diversity in broad comparative perspective. This also serves as a platform for critically evaluating claims of human ecological or evolutionary uniqueness.

      SE604 - Human Behavioural Ecology

      
      
       This course covers the field of human behavioural ecology with a nearly exclusive focus on small scale foraging societies. In this sense it is a survey of hunter-gatherer behavioural diversity viewed through the lens of adaptation by natural selection. Scientists in many fields often place a scientific premium on the study of hunter-gatherer (forager) populations because humans lived as hunter-gatherers for the majority (nearly all) of their time on the planet. Economically speaking we study hunter-gatherer diversity because we encounter a diversity of traits and conditions that cannot be found by studying the ecologically unusual environments occupied by humans reliant on post-industrial technologies. Thus, we often focus on hunter-gatherer behavioural variation to understand the origins of human uniqueness and the evolutionary roots of many human behaviours in general. The only way to evaluate when and if claims based on forager diversity are true is to critically examine both the motivating theory and the data. This course accomplishes that task while also familiarizing students with a) human behavioural ecology (HBE) as a field, (HBE is the dominant evolutionary perspective in anthropology today) and b) hunter-gatherer ecology across the globe.  The module provides an in-depth overview of the field of human behavioural ecology with a focus on foraging populations from around the globe. Additionally, the study of hunter-gatherers is placed into the development and history of anthropology as a discipline. Ecological and evolutionary models are presented and explained. A variety of key areas of human behaviour are examined: subsistence, mobility, sharing, territoriality, the division of labour, social organization, political organization, and the pre-history of hunter-gatherers.

      SE605 - Hormones and Behaviour

      
      
       If behaviour has been shaped by natural selection, then those behaviours must have some biological basis. This module explores the extent to which hormonal mechanisms provide such a biological explanation of behaviour in humans and our primate cousins. Students will learn the basics of the endocrine system, and consider both how hormones affect behaviour and how behaviour may affect hormones. This module will examine the role that hormones play in the differentiation of behaviours between females and males, as well as the evidence that sexual, parental, aggressive, and affiliative behaviours are influenced by hormones. Students will thus complete this module with a greater appreciation of the hormonal underpinnings of the complex sociality that characterizes humans and other primates.

      SE585 - From the Raw to the Cooked: The Anthropology of Eating

      
      
       Students will learn about the evolution and significance of food production, especially in relation to globalisation, identity and health.  The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development.  it will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation.  Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings.  We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporarary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

       Genetics forms the basis of the diversity of life on earth, and is fundamental to biodiversity, speciation, evolutionary ecology, and has become recognized to be vital to the successful restoration of endangered species. An understanding of the evolutionary processes that foster biodiversity and genetic diversity is essential for modern conservation biologists, across timescales ranging from a few generations to millions of years. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of genetic processes and evolutionary mechanisms within the context of conservation.

      SE575 - Medicinal Plants: Home Remedy, Pharmaceutical, Illicit Drug

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ethnopharmacology, a multidisciplinary field of study that employs chemistry, ecology, biology, pharmacology and anthropology to evaluate and understand the use of plants (and other substances) in non-western medical systems.  While  students will be introduced to all of the disciplines involved in ethnopharmacological research, this module will have a heavy anthropological focus.  Lecture and reading materials will address questions related to the actions of natural products in the human body, the ecological and evolutionary basis of medicinal plants use, the epistemology of non-western medical systems, the efficacy of medicinal plants and the development of pharmaceuticals based on traditional medicines.  Topics discussed in class will provide ideas and models for student   research projects. This module should appeal to students with interests in anthropology  and/or medical care/research.

      SE580 - Primate Behaviour and Ecology

      
      
       This module introduces students to the discipline of behavioural ecology, with particular reference to non-human primates. The module looks at the patterns and principles that can be generalised from the variation in behaviour and ecology across primate species. Set within an evolutionary behavioural-ecological framework, this module combines established findings with the latest research. It emphasises the importance of direct observations of primate behaviour and the use of theoretical models with which to make sense of these data. The module covers social and reproductive behaviour within primate groups, the nature and evolution of primate societies, and cognition and communication, as well as interactions between primates and their environments: primates as foragers, predators and prey. The module will make particular use of multi-media technology to allow students to see and hear primates in their natural habitats.
