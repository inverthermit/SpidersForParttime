Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.






 
  Year abroad

  
   You have the opportunity to spend a year abroad between Stages 2 and 3, studying at one of our partner universities in Europe (Amsterdam, Berlin, Bologna, Lausanne and Paris); the USA (California and Indiana); or Asia (Hong Kong).

Please note exchanges are offered subject to availability and in some cases will be dependent on which degree you are studying at Kent. In most cases, students must also meet the academic and attendance requirements set by their school or faculty in order to study/work abroad.

At present, students on this programme are required to gain an average mark of 60% at Stage 1 and Stage 2. All marks, including wild modules, count in the calculation of the average. Students must also complete and submit the Overseas Travel Health Questionnaire (this will be sent to them with instructions at the appropriate time) and attend a compulsory pre-departure briefing from the Go Abroad team.
