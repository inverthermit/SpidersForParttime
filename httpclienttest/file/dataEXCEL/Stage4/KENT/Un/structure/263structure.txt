Who determines what is regarded as a social problem?  What are the roles of politicians, pressure groups, the public and the media in constructing and defining a social problem?  Dean H 2006 p.1. suggests:Social policy entails the study of the social relations necessary for human well-being and the systems by which well-being may be promoted.  Its about the many and various things that affect the kinds of life that you and I and everyone can live. ..well-being is about how well people are not how well they doWelfare or well-being?

      SO687 - The Politics of Criminal Justice

      
      
       This module traces the way in which criminal justice and criminal justice policy have become increasingly politicised in recent years.  It utilises topics such as community safety, penology and 'dangerous offenders' to highlight the interaction between popular opinion, research, policy formation and the criminalisation of particular groups within society.  The module will analyse the manner in which crime has become such an important issue on the political agenda, as well as the important role that practitioners and pressure groups have played in mediating political rhetoric and policy.

      SO700 - Contested Cities

      
      
       This module is a honours level module that introduces key ideas in urban sociology. Although the module considers the historical development of cities, the focus is on the contemporary city and the ways in which it is experienced by different social groups. The module will hence focus on key questions of who belongs in - and who is excluded from - the city, and will include discussion of the ways that marginal social groups - for example, the homeless, ethnic minorities, sexual dissidents, the elderly and the young - often find their presence in the city questioned by the social 'majority'. Key concepts here include questions of belonging, transgression, discipline, surveillance and the control of space. This module will hence show how sociological theories and ideas can help us understand cities as complex, multicultural and contested, and hopefully also encourage students to think about the city as a key site of sociological enquiry.The module will include an element of self-led fieldwork in the Medway towns designed to encourage students to think about the social experience of spaces of consumption in the city.

      SO650 - Youth, Crime and Criminal Justice

      
      
       This module will examine the contemporary debates emerging in the field of youth justice and encourage students to consider the various stances taken.  Youth crime is a field that frequently attracts much public, political and media attention, and the aim of this module is to encourage students to critically assess the true prevalence and severity of crime committed by young people.  The module starts by locating the fascination with youth and crime in its historical context, before moving on to examine the developing and competing claims and theories which sought to explain why young people commit crime.  It then concludes by providing a critique of societal responses to young people who violate the law and how the state seeks to prevent children from violating the law in the first place.

      SO628 - Drugs - Production and Use in their Cultural Context

      
      
       Drugs form an integral part of human culture, with a wide range of medical, religious and recreational applications. They are often so central to social life that they are not identified as drugs and they are differentiated from drugs used by 'other' cultures. In contrast to policy discussion which is dominated by links with crime and social dysfunction, the cultural approach focuses on the socially constructive role of drugs, and how patterns have changed due to commodification and globalisation. Concepts like addiction and the link with crime will be subject of critical analysis. At the outset, the module will explore the role of drug use in religion, ritual, and social settings, and look for contrasts between models of integrated and functional, as well as alienated and dysfunctional drug use. Topics include methods of classification of substances, the association with economic expansion, political domination, social stratification and the emergence of a culture of consumption. The module course then discusses how the above issues are aligned with prevailing social and ethical values.Studies of drug use in different subcultures in the UK and other western societies will be contrasted with work on drug use in different cultural contexts. The module will look at the way drug use is integrated into cultural practice, yet open to discussion and different evaluation.

       This module aims to provide a broad introduction to social ethics. It will give students moral frameworks with which to address contemporary issues affecting social and professional issues. The module explores how everyday encounters have ethical dimensions, which are often neglected in sociological accounts. A range of topics will be examined, including euthanasia, abortion, lying, capital punishment, prostitution, cannibalism, fair wage, family responsibilities, professionalism and philanthropy. We will draw upon several ethical perspectives, such as utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics and theories of justice, to understand these topics.

      SO628 - Drugs - Production and Use in their Cultural Context

      
      
       Drugs form an integral part of human culture, with a wide range of medical, religious and recreational applications. They are often so central to social life that they are not identified as drugs and they are differentiated from drugs used by 'other' cultures. In contrast to policy discussion which is dominated by links with crime and social dysfunction, the cultural approach focuses on the socially constructive role of drugs, and how patterns have changed due to commodification and globalisation. Concepts like addiction and the link with crime will be subject of critical analysis. At the outset, the module will explore the role of drug use in religion, ritual, and social settings, and look for contrasts between models of integrated and functional, as well as alienated and dysfunctional drug use. Topics include methods of classification of substances, the association with economic expansion, political domination, social stratification and the emergence of a culture of consumption. The module course then discusses how the above issues are aligned with prevailing social and ethical values.Studies of drug use in different subcultures in the UK and other western societies will be contrasted with work on drug use in different cultural contexts. The module will look at the way drug use is integrated into cultural practice, yet open to discussion and different evaluation. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO650 - Youth, Crime and Criminal Justice

      
      
       This module will examine the contemporary debates emerging in the field of youth justice and encourage students to consider the various stances taken.  Youth crime is a field that frequently attracts much public, political and media attention, and the aim of this module is to encourage students to critically assess the true prevalence and severity of crime committed by young people.  The module starts by locating the fascination with youth and crime in its historical context, before moving on to examine the developing and competing claims and theories which sought to explain why young people commit crime.  It then concludes by providing a critique of societal responses to young people who violate the law and how the state seeks to prevent children from violating the law in the first place.

       This module confronts many of the myths and mistaken assumptions concerning gender roles during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with regard to women's participation in paid and unpaid work.  Drawing on the extensive literature of feminist historians on womens work in Britain and on sociological insights, the module explores the themes of gender, paid employment and the family and investigates both historical change and continuity.

      SO700 - Contested Cities

      
      
       This module is a honours level module that introduces key ideas in urban sociology. Although the module considers the historical development of cities, the focus is on the contemporary city and the ways in which it is experienced by different social groups. The module will hence focus on key questions of who belongs in - and who is excluded from - the city, and will include discussion of the ways that marginal social groups - for example, the homeless, ethnic minorities, sexual dissidents, the elderly and the young - often find their presence in the city questioned by the social 'majority'. Key concepts here include questions of belonging, transgression, discipline, surveillance and the control of space. This module will hence show how sociological theories and ideas can help us understand cities as complex, multicultural and contested, and hopefully also encourage students to think about the city as a key site of sociological enquiry.The module will include an element of self-led fieldwork in the Medway towns designed to encourage students to think about the social experience of spaces of consumption in the city.

The module will analyse the manner in which crime has become such an important issue on the political agenda, as well as the important role that practitioners and pressure groups have played in mediating political rhetoric and policy.

      SO681 - Restorative Justice: Concepts, Issues,    Debates

      
      
       Unprecedented levels of incarceration and prevailing fear of crime and anti-social disorder have prompted a review of traditional systems of dealing with offenders. After years of prison expansion concerted efforts are being put in place in many Western countries to reduce the number of people in custody. There is a range of alternative forms of managing offenders including restorative justice, community punishments and drug courts. The main aim of this module is to provide students with a critical understanding of these alternative models in a wider historical and cross cultural context. It will explore key values, issues and debates setin the context of theoretical arguments and criminal justice policy and practice.

       This module explores the nature and dynamics of power in modern societies. Power is examined from a range of theoretical perspectives and a variety of empirical studies, drawing upon sociology and political science. We will discuss how power is inescapably political and always multilayered, operating at the structural, corporal and symbolic levels, moving between the macro and the micro, and involving relationships of domination, as groups compete over resources and ideas. The module will also focus on different forms of resistance, political participation and contentious action, relating them to structures of power.
