  Year in industry

  
   Biochemistry offers the possibility of doing a one-year placement away from the University between Stages 2 and 3. Sandwich placements provide an excellent opportunity to gain relevant work experience, usually in the pharmaceutical industry or a research institute. These placements can be in the UK or abroad. You are paid by your employer and produce an independent research project.

On a sandwich placement you acquire additional skills and gain first-hand experience of a particular type of work, which will help to inform your career decisions at the end of your degree. Students have worked at companies including: GlaxoSmithKline, MedImmune, Lonza, BASF, Eli Lilly and Bayer Crop Science.

Progression: To progress to stage 2 you must achieve an overall average of 65% in Stage 1 unless you applied before July and met the conditions of the entry offer made. If the 65% requirement is not met, you will be transferred to the equivalent 3-year programme which is identical except for the year spent away from the University.

Visit the School of Biosciences web pages
 for more information about the sandwich option, including comments from past students.
  


   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      BI797 - Sandwich Year Assessment

      
      
       A placement typically is a 9-12 month internship with a commercial or public sector or charity organisation which provides opportunities for the student to develop graduate level subject-specific and generic employability skills. Choice of placement by student will be guided and facilitated at UoK with the learning outcomes listed above in mind. It is requested by UoK that the student be closely guided in work (usually with a named supervisor) involving specialist training. Placements are expected to have a scientific research focus and incorporate a project element that may be written up as a scientific report, however, the specific type of work undertaken may vary significantly from placement to placement. The research project should occupy not less than thirty percent of the sandwich year. 

       Credits: 120 credits (60 ECTS credits).

      BI600 - Biology Project

      
      
       Early in the Autumn term, projects are assigned to students, where possible in accordance with student choice.  Students then meet individually or in small groups with their project supervisor to discuss the objectives of the project and obtain guidance on reading to ensure a good background before embarking on the project work.The main project activities take place in the Spring term. Formal meetings may be arranged at the discretion of the student and supervisor.  Students are expected to dedicate 300 hours to their project work.  Non-laboratory students are strongly encouraged to meet with the supervisor at least once a week to discuss progress and ideas and to resolve problems.  At the end of the formal project time, students are allowed time to complete the final project report, although they are encouraged to start writing as early as possible during the Spring term.  The supervisor reads a draft of the report, provided it is handed in by an agreed time, and provides feedback on content and style.  Organisation and Content:  Projects are designed by individual members of staff in keeping with their research interests and fall into one of five categories:1. Laboratory: wet or dry practical research undertaken in the teaching laboratories, followed by preparation of a written report. To be guaranteed the opportunity to undertake a laboratory project, students must have achieved and average of at least 55% in the second year. 2. Dissertation: library-based research leading to production of a report in the style of a scientific review3. Business: development of a biotechnology business plan4. Communication: similar to dissertation projects but with an emphasis on presenting the scientific topic to a general, non-scientist audience

      BI640 - Magnetic Resonance in Biosciences and Medicine

      
      
       Magnetic resonance (MR) and remained a fundamental scientific method for several decades since its conception in 1938 but in the last 25 years, it has been successfully applied within biosciences and medicine as both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This module is designed for students with an interest in the applications of NMR and MRI and our approach and will be taught by example using real-world data, current research papers and reviews to reveal the utility of these methods across biosciences and medicine.This course begins by providing a basic understanding of MR for NMR and MRI as they both utilise identical methodologies. This section introduces, in a pictographic manner, general concepts relevant to NMR and MRI approaches discussed later in the module such as the experimental optimization, quantitation of biomedical metabolites and the production of contrast and signal in MRI images. The remainder of the module is split equally between describing some of many the applications, advantages and limitations of NMR and MRI. The NMR section focuses on the biological uses of NMR with the main emphasis on medical applications toward cell and tissue metabolism. Metabolite NMR is especially interesting as it has recently emerged as an important technique to monitor and map molecular markers in the study of many disease and conditions. The MRI section discusses MRI equipment, theory of medical MRI imaging, vascular and cardiac MRI, following tissue and organ activity, metabolic MRI methods and functional MRI (fMRI). fMRI is the gold-standard method to study brain activity using blood flow and can be used to assess tumours, stroke, head and brain injury or diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease.The course is delivered through 22 lectures and two feedback sessions for coursework.
