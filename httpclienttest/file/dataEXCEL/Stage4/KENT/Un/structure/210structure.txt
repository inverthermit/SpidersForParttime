 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SO336 - Sociology of Everyday Life

      
      
       Sociology offers insight into how society works. To do this, we question and look behind the common sense view of everything in the social world. This course looks at a range of important and topical aspects of society and explains how we can make better sense of them by thinking sociologically. The aim is to introduce students to the wide range of topics which comprise contemporary Sociology and indicate how social circumstances shape and influence our lives. Why do powerful differences and inequalities between men and women persist even though both are now formally equal? Why, in a world that is safer and healthier than ever before, do we witness so much concern about risks such as to our health, children and security. These are type of questions we will begin to answer. The course is suitable both for those who have studied sociology at A level, and those who have not. There is a considerable emphasis on interactive discussion, through weekly seminar groups.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO337 - Fundamentals of Sociology

      
      
       This course provides grounding in the basic history and assumptions of sociological thinking and research, and how they apply to key aspects of our society. Topics are less from everyday experience than in the Sociology of Everyday Life course, focusing on more abstract topics such as the state and globalization. Students will also be encouraged to consider competing perspectives on these topics and how they might be assessed. There will be a lecture and seminar each week and students will be encouraged to engage in informed discussion and debate. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO408 - Sociological Theory: The Classics

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the major issues and controversies surrounding the definition, development and teaching of classical social theory. It introduces students to the key problems that have set the agendas for sociological inquiry as well as the main concepts and theoretical traditions that have shaped sociological thought.   A considerable debate surrounds the meaning of classical social theory and what should be associated with this term.  For some, classical social theory refers to ideas developed by a generation of thinkers whose works belong to a particular period of our cultural/intellectual history (usually dated c.1880- c.1920). Others understand this as a label for canonical texts that define the project and enterprise of sociology. For many, it simply means the works of Karl Marx, &Eacute;mile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel (the so-called founding fathers of the discipline). Classical sociology has also been identified as a critical tradition of placing society in question so as individuals may be better equipped to understand how their personal troubles are the product of determining socio-economic structures and processes.  Each of these approaches to understanding classical social theory will be explored and analysed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SA300 - Social Problems and Social Policy I: Youth,The family and the State

      
      
       This module is designed both for students intending to specialise in social policy, and for other students who are interested in social problems and responses to them. We explore the ways in which phenomena come to be labelled as social problems, we focus upon the problem of youth and why certain youth behaviours are seen as problematic, who defines them as such and what is expected in terms of the balance between state and family responsibility.  Issues explored include: young peoples changing relationship to the family; teenage pregnancy; education, transitions to work, migration drug (mis)use, youth homelessness and anti-social behaviour.

      SO334 - Modern Culture

      
      
       This module introduces students to discussions and debates surrounding modern culture. It looks at why culture has always been such a contested sphere and has a decisive impact on society at large. Students will look at culture in the widest sense, ranging from the arts to the banalities of everyday life in our consumer society; at how culture has expressed and organised the way people think and live from the days of 'protestantism' to those of post-punk. Books, magazines, radio, TV, movies, cartoons, fashion, graffiti, the cult of celebrity, youth subcultures and pop music will be used to understand class, history, sexuality, colonialism, revolution, conflict and globalisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO305 - Introduction to Criminology

      
      
       Crime is a major social and political issue and the source of much academic and popular debate.  Key criminological issues will be examined during the course of the module within their wider sociological and social policy context.  There will be a particular focus on understanding the nature and extent of crime and victimisation, analysing public and media perceptions of crime, and exploring the relationship between key social divisions (age, gender and ethnicity) and patterns of offending and victimisation.

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE588 - Advanced Social Anthropology 1: Power and Economy

      
      
       The module is a cross-cultural analysis of economic and political institutions, and the ways in which they transform over time. Throughout the term, we draw upon a range of ethnographic research and social theory, to investigate the political and conceptual questions raised by the study of power and economy. The module engages with the development and key debates of political and economic anthropology, and explores how people experience, and acquire power over social and economic resources. Students are asked to develop perspectives on the course material that are theoretically informed and empirically grounded, and to apply them to the political and economic questions of everyday life. The module covers the following topics: the relationship between power and authority; key concepts and theoretical debates in economic anthropology; sharing and egalitarianism; gift exchange; sexual inequality; violence; the nation state; money; social class; work; commodification; financialisation. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE589 - Advanced Social Anthropology II: Religion &  Cosmological Imagination

      
      
       This module is focused on a diverse range of approaches deployed by anthropologists to the study of religion, and belief and symbolic systems. It introduces a range of an-thropological insights to the ongoing transformations of religious traditions and belief systems vis-&agrave;-vis colonial encounters, post-colonial settings, as well as globalisation. The aim of the module is to familiarize students with the complex interactions between lived religious practice, religious traditions, and the ways in which these are intertwined with other domains of social life, politics, economics and ideology. The key topics covered in this module focus on ritual and sacrifice; witchcraft and sorcery; secularisation and fundamentalism; millennialism and conversion; cosmology and ideology; human and non-human relationships; modes of religiosity, rationality and belief; mediation and ethics. This module will develop students awareness of the strengths and limitations of anthropological insights compared to other disciplinary perspectives on religion such as theology, cognitive science or sociology.

      SE586 - Ethnographies 1

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of reading four professional ethnographic monographs in their entirety.  The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the thematic topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology I module, i.e. Kinship and Social Organisation, and Economic Systems.  Students will be expected to come to seminars with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology I.  Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier class meetings, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      SE587 - Ethnographies 2

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of professional ethnographic monographs of varying length to be read at the rate of one (or selected substantial parts of one) monograph per week. The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the analytical topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology 2 module, thereby divided into two congruent blocs. These are labelled Power and Authority and Belief and Practice [see Module specification for SE 589]. Students will be expected to come to class with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology 1. Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier classes, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      SO727 - Contemporary Sociological Theory

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the major issues and controversies that have shaped key developments in contemporary social theory. It surveys the development of social theory through the second half of the twentieth century and up to the present day. Following on from the SO408 module on classical social theory, it questions the distinction between the classical and the contemporary so as to highlight the intellectual decisions, values and problems involved in the packaging of social theory under these terms. It also provides critical introductions to the following theorists and issues:  Talcott Parsons and his legacy; Symbolic Interactionism up to Goffman and beyond; The Frankfurt School: Critical theory and the crisis of western marxism; Jurgen Habermas and the decline of the public sphere; Michel Foucault and a his understanding of power; Pierre Bourdieu and the reproduction of inequality; From Modernity to Post-modernity?;  The feminizing of social theory; Globalization, networks and mobilities; New challenges for the twenty-first century.

      SE547 - South East Asian Societies

      
      
       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      SE549 - The Anthropology of Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

      SE550 - The Anthropology of Gender

      
      
       This module explores the central historical and contemporary debates in the anthropology of gender, including: the search for universal principles underlying gender inequality (such as nature/culture and domestic/public), relationships between gender, sex, and sexuality, how gender articulates with other indices of difference such as race, class and nation, gendered perspectives on power, the interaction of agency and structure in the production of femininities and masculinities, gender and technology, gender and the state, and gendered modernities.  A key concern of the module will be to understand, discuss and debate how the primarily qualitative methods of ethnographic research can inform and further these debates.  The module will first review the historiography of theoretical developments in the anthropology of gender and feminist anthropology, then move on to consider key classic and contemporary ethnographies to explore how they contribute to our ability to analyse and understand gender.

      SE554 - Visual Anthropology Theory

      
      
       This module is a general introduction to visual anthropology. It includes treatment of cross-cultural cognition and symbolic analysis, the social history of still photography and film relating to ethnographic subjects, the study of national and regional cinematic traditions (outside Europe and America), the comparative ethnography of television and broader consideration of issues of social representation and political ideology in visual imagery, combining empirical ethnographic analysis of these issues with the alternative (complementary) contributions of scholars of visual imagery from a literary and humanistic tradition of interpretation. It includes a short practical introduction to different visual media, but extended practical experience is available only through the project modules.

      SE555 - Project in Visual Anthropology

      
      
       Within the Anthropology degree programme this module represents an optional component of Part II studies, namely the practical study of visual representations. It assumes that students will be taking SE554 Visual Anthropology Theory as a prerequisite. Its distinctiveness relative to the other module is that it focuses principally on the exploration of theoretical issues, through the development of an ethnographic project, focussed on either photography or video and delivered as multimedia. The module requires the making a visual project (a photographic essay, a short ethnographic film) with practical instruction in developing, editing and mounting procedures.Students will be introduced to basic techniques of visual production and presentation. The practical component of the course cannot attempt to provide qualified instruction in professional photographic or video production expertise, and we are narrowly constrained by the limited equipment and technical support available. The visual project is intended to give practical experience of general techniques of visual communication that should critically inform understanding of more theoretical topics dealt with in the module. Techniques of camera use, instruction (theoretical and practical) on research methods, practice and demonstration of visual presentation will all be taught sequentially, and linked to students practical experience in formulating and producing their projects.

      SE573 - Ethnicity and Nationalism

      
      
       Ethnicity and nationalism are matters of contemporary urgency (as we are daily reminded by the media), but while the meanings of these terms are taken for granted, what actually constitutes ethnicity and nationalism, and how they have been historically constituted, is neither clear nor self-evident. This module begins with a consideration of the major theories of nationalism and ethnicity, and then moves on to a series of case studies taken from various societies around the world., and then moves on to examine a number of other important conceptsindigeneity, race, hybridity, authenticity, invention of tradition, multiculturalism, globalizationthat can help us appreciate the complexity and dynamics of ethnic identities. The general aim of the module is to enable and encourage students to think critically beyond established, homogenous and static ethnic categories.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      SE585 - From the Raw to the Cooked: The Anthropology of Eating

      
      
       Students will learn about the evolution and significance of food production, especially in relation to globalisation, identity and health.  The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development.  it will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation.  Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings.  We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporarary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

       Contraception, abortion, and teenage pregnancy are the subjects of public controversy in Britain. This module takes these aspects of reproductive health as its main examples. We will consider why contraception, abortion and teenage pregnancy became the subject of policy-making, and look at how policy about them has changed over time. Attention will be drawn to areas of debate that are currently particularly controversial, to encourage students to consider the ways in which policy could develop.

      SO601 - Welfare in Modern Britain

      
      
       This module provides students with basic accounts of the scope and scale of the British welfare system, and the theoretical basis for its existence and growth. The recent history and current organisation of the main areas of social welfare provision such as social security, education, health, social care and housing are explored. These services which comprise the welfare state are situated in the broader context of welfare provided from non-state sources: the family, the market, community and voluntary sector and debates regarding how welfare should be provided and funded. The module examines how policies are formulated and the processes through which they are implemented and revised. It also considers the impact that social policies have on social inequality and difference based on class, ethnicity, gender, disability or age. Welfare in Modern Britain is a core module for those taking Social Policy and related degrees, but is also relevant to those with an interest in contemporary social problems and the policies aimed at addressing them.

       This module will introduce students to the analysis of health policy focusing on recent policy changes in the UK and identifying the major influences which have shaped these policies.  There have been considerable changes in health service policy and health policy in the UK over the last decade involving changes to existing policies and the development of new policy themes. The latter have included a growing recognition of the need to address inequalities through public health policies but the relative neglect of environmental health policies, a focus on the views and/or the voice of the user and the public, the emergence of evidence-based policy and practice, the marketisation and privatisation of health care, the introduction of managerialism and the attempts to regulate the medical profession. This module provides an analysis of these recent policy developments and explores to what extent they reflect significant shifts in policy. What shapes these policies is examined through an exploration of the influence of professional medicine and other occupational groups including CAM, the pharmaceutical industry, the State, patients groups and the wider global environment. It links analysis of the theory of policy making with an analysis of empirical examples.

       Welfare states face many challenges in the contemporary world. This course takes a comparative approach by systematically analysing key fields to show how a variety of countries have identified and tackled problems of social policy. It starts with a consideration of theoretical frameworks but most of the course is directed at consideration of welfare issues in different countries and to specific topics: globalisation, migration, population ageing, disability, the cuts and so on. In this way, the student is provided with a systematic overview of some of the main areas in which international and national social policy agendas co evolve. It is intended for students of social policy, social work, and social sciences.

       The module provides an introduction to social and political issues raised by food and its provision, exploring how sociologists, social anthropologists and policy analysts have addressed this area. The module examines the role of food within the household and beyond, exploring the ways in which food and food practices make manifest social categorisations such as gender, age, ethnicity and religion. Using the examples of vegetarianism and religion, it examines the way food is entwined with symbolic and moral categorisations. The module as also addresses the political and policy issues raised by food, exploring government involvement in the area of ingestion, drawing parallels between food, alcohol and tobacco. In doing so it addresses the political issues raised by the large corporate interests of the food industry, and the role of the market in shaping provision. It addresses questions of public health, dietary adequacy and the future of the welfare state through sessions on schools meals and food banks.

       This module will examine the impact of digital technology on our social and cultural lives. It will concentrate on how the Internet in particular has challenged some of our more traditional notions of identity and self, the body, relationships, community, privacy, politics, friendship, war and crime, economics, among others. Lectures will show how some of the basic components of culture such as notions of identity, space, the body, community, and even the very notion of what it is to be human, have been complicated by the rise of virtuality and cyberspace. We will also examine these issues through case study phenomena unique to digital culture, currently including gaming, music, cybersex and social networking.

       The course is concerned with the relatively new ideas of living in a risk society which theoretically capture the heightened sensitivity within Western societies to the numerous risks which shape our lives. The course will explore basic concepts of risk, hazard and probability and how risk is managed and communicated. Topics will include risk and globalization, and risk and the media. Developments will be examined through key examples such as mad cow disease and genetically modified frankenfoods. The course will suggest that heightened perception of risk is here to stay, and is leading to a reorganisation of society in important areas.

      SO668 - The Sociology of Work

      
      
       Work and economic life is one of the central themes of sociology. Work allows us to think about class, gender, race and issues of identity. Work defines how people live their lives and is a major constituting factor in identity formation. In recent years work has changed enormously with the rise of globalisation, of deindustrialisation and the ending of old certainties which used to underpin working lives. This module examines how sociology and sociologists have looked at the issue of work in the past as well as in contemporary societies. It charts the theoretical background to the assumptions sociologists make about work as well as the methods they use to investigate work and employment. The module will focus on issues industrialisation, deindustrialisation, notions of career and identity and places and spaces of work. A major part of this module is the discussion of innovative ways of looking at work including through visual methods and approaches, and in addition it will draw on material from the arts and humanities.

      SO676 - Cultures of Embodiment

      
      
       Images of trim, taut and terrific bodies surround us in contemporary consumer culture. They look down on us from billboards, are increasingly central to advertisers attempts to sell us clothes, cosmetics, cars, and other products, and pervade reality television programmes based on diet, exercise and extreme makeovers. These trends have occurred at the same time that science, technology, genetic engineering and medicine have achieved unprecedented levels of control over the body: there are now few parts of the body which cannot be remoulded, supplemented or transplanted in one way or another. In this course we explore how culture represents and shapes bodies, and also examine how embodied subjects are themselves able to act on and influence the culture in which they live. We will seek to understand the relationship between the body and self-identity, embodiment and inequalities, and will explore various theories of the body. In doing this we range far and wide by looking at such issues as cyberbodies, religion, food, film, transgenderism, sport, music, work and sleep. Embodiment is the enduring theme of  this course, though, and we will explore its many dimensions via a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, and by asking and addressing a range of questions such as How and why has the body become increasingly commodified?, Why has the body become increasingly central to so many peoples sense of self-identity?, If we live in a culture that has been able to intervene in the sizes, shapes and contents of the body like never before, have people have become less sure about what is natural about the body, and about how we should care for and treat our bodily selves?.

      SO678 - Caring for Vulnerable Adults: Understanding Social Care

      
      
       Social care is of central significance in the support of a range of vulnerable adults. As such it is one of the key services of the welfare state, though one that often loses out to higher profile concern with medical care.   In this module we trace the development of social care from its origins in nineteenth century philanthropy, through its consolidation as a key service within the post war welfare state, to its current state of flux as it becomes increasingly fragmented and subject to new models of provision. The module looks at the care experiences of people with physical disabilities whether acquired in childhood or as result of accident or illness later in life; with learning difficulties; and mental health problems; as well as frail older people, exploring user perspectives and questions of empowerment.   It also addresses those who provide care and support in the form of family carers and paid workers, whether social workers or care assistants, addressing policy debates concerning the role of the state and family in provision.  It analyses the key social and policy debates in this field: for example: can we afford the cost of the rising numbers of older people? What role does ageism play in recent scandals about the quality of care provision? How can we support family carers?  How do we integrate people with learning disability into wider society?  In doing so it raises issues of funding, affordability and the mixed economy of care, as well as addressing fundamental questions about how disability, age and care are experienced and understood.

       This module aims to enable students to design and conduct their own piece of research. This can be primary research where students collect and analyse their own data, or it can be library based, where students research existing literature or re-analyse data collected by others. The research can be about a particular policy or policy area, social problem, social development, or matter of sociological interest. The dissertation will usually be set out as a series of chapters. In order to assist students with designing and writing a dissertation a supervisor  a member of staff in SSPSSR - will have an initial meeting with students (during the summer term of Year 2 where possible) and then during the Autumn and Spring terms students will have at least six formal dissertation sessions with their supervisor. These may be held individually or with other students. In addition there will be two lectures by the module convenor which will also support students progress.

       This is a core module for Cultural Studies programmes, but is also open to and suitable for students on other programmes in the Social Sciences and Humanities. It may also be taken as a wild option. In each term, the module examines theories and analyses central to the development of the study of culture within two distinct trajectories.In the Autumn term, the module introduces and applies ideas in critical, cultural and communications theory to debates and issues surrounding media and popular culture, focusing on such themes as cultural elitism, power and control, the formation of identities, the politics of representation, and the cultural circuit of production and consumption. It investigates the relationship between the development of contemporary society and societal values and the changing technological basis of mediated culture. In the Spring term, the module combines theoretical and methodological approaches to examine how our understandings of the past, present and future are mediated and remediated in social, cultural and political contexts. Over the course of the term, it will debate and critically explore the relationship between lived experience, memory and the imagination, the politics of cultural heritage and how social myths are developed and used in the construction of cultural identity. It will question how we think about what constitutes cultural history, how we envisage the future and our role in both.

      SO509 - Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       Health, illness and medicine are by no means static concepts. Their meaning has changed over time, and there is competition and conflict over what they mean. For example, in recent decades, health has come to mean much more the absence of disease. This is the age of healthy eating, sexual health, holistic health, healthy lifestyles and healthy living. We live in a time when medicine can mean homeopathy or acupuncture, as well as heart surgery and vaccinations. Health is also something we seem to worry about, and panic over; recent years have witnessed high profile scares about eating beef, using the contraceptive pill and mobile phones, and giving babies the MMR vaccine. Health, Illness and Medicine discusses key ideas and concepts developed by social scientists that can help us understand these, and other, aspects of our society.

       This module introduces students to the sociological approach to understanding mental health. It begins by outlining historical definitions of mental health and how policy and practice have changed over time from incarceration in large institutions to present-day community care. Sociological perspectives of mental illness (for example, the sociology of suicide, labelling and social causations of mental ill-health)  are considered alongside psychiatric and psychological approaches to treating people with mental illnesses. The module then looks at social inequalities in relation to opportunities to recover, including gender and race, as well as where sufferers are within the life-course (including young people and older people with dementia).Mental health and the criminal justice system as well as religion/spirituality and faith are also explored.  Please note, as this is not a clinical module material covered will not include in-depth investigations of specific diagnoses of mental illnesses.

       This module provides students with a sociological and criminological understanding of contemporary issues relating to young people, crime and deviance. More specifically, the module provides a critical understanding of young peoples involvement in crime and deviance and the various responses to youth crime, especially how young people are dealt with by the youth justice system. We begin by examining current trends in youth offending and explore media responses and then go on to look at the youth problem from an historical context. We will then go on to focus in depth on several substantive topics, including gangs and violent crime; drugs, alcohol and nightlife; young people, urban space and antisocial behaviour; and the youth justice system in England and Wales. Throughout the module, attention is given to the importance of understanding the connections of youth crime with race, class and gender and at the same time, engages with key theoretical ideas and debates that inform our understandings of youth crime. This unit provides an opportunity to engage with the most up-to-date debates in an area of great interest in contemporary society.

       What is meant by racism? Charges of racism are seemingly everywhere  in the workplace, in the streets, in everyday interactions. But what exactly is racism? Is it beliefs about racial inferiority or superiority? Is it found in actions and consequences whether people intended to be racist or not? We will first review various theories of racism, and critically assess how changing conceptualisations of racism arise in specific, socio-political contexts. We will also consider whether a colour-blind future is desirable and/or possible.

       This module provides a broad-based introduction to the concept of childhood, its historical evolution (including contemporary influences arising from new technologies and electronic media) and its 'social construction'. Within this context, different perspectives on childrens rights are examined, contrasting those which emphasise children's vulnerability and need for forms of protection and others which argue for children's participation, empowerment or even liberation. The module will also examine contemporary social problems e.g. child labour, sexual exploitation in terms of understandings of childhood and children's rights. Although there are no formal co-requisites for this module, its subject matter fits well with that covered in SA531 The Care and Protection of Children.

      SO684 - Globalization and Development

      
      
       This module aims to develop a critical understanding of one of the most important intellectual and political issues of our times, namely, globalization and its relationship to development in third world societies. Examples of the central issues to be examined are: what is globalization and what forms does it take?

      SO575 - Poverty, Inequality and Social Security

      
      
       The coalition government has argued that following the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent double-drip recession adoption, the UK has no option but to pursue austerity policies.  This has included a huge squeeze on spending on cash transfers often referred to as 'welfare'.This module focuses on poverty and inequality and how such social security policies impact upon them.  Students will analyse the nature, extent and causes of poverty and inequality, with reference to the UK.  The module will make students aware of current issues in welfare reform as it relates to groups vulnerable to poverty including:  people who are unemployed;  people who are sick or disabled;  older people;  children;  lone parents;  people from Black or minority ethnic groups.  The module also shows how social security policies encompass different principles of need, rights and entitlement for users of welfare services.It is designed to be of interest to Sociology and Health and Social Care students as well as Social Policy students.

      SO702 - Sociology and Social Politics of the Family

      
      
       Often presented as the most natural form of human organisation, the family's changing nature over time indicates it is no such thing. Particularly since the Second World War, driven by the transformation of women's position within society, the very idea of a typical family has been called into question. The numbers of those choosing to live alone in contemporary society even calls into question the very notion of family at all. This module explores how the family has changed historically in its role and relationship to the individual and society. We trace the development of the modern, private family and how it has been shaped by socio-economic, cultural and political pressures. We will particularly focus upon the tension between this private 'haven in a heartless world' and a society anxious about the family's apparent instability.Synopsis of the curriculum The social history of the family and its transformations. The sociology of the public/private split The evolution of policies relating to family life  The individualisation thesis The economics and obligations of the family Recent social and demographic changes considered to underlie the problem of  the contemporary family (changes in fertility patterns, in marriage and co-habitation, the rise of single person households)  Debates about specific current policies about parenting  Critiques of state intervention in family life

      SO710 - War, Atrocity and Genocide

      
      
       This is an interdisciplinary module on war, atrocity and genocide. Drawing on a range of sources from military history, social psychology, sociology, criminology, political ethics and political history, it is concerned to explore the following questions: What is war and why is it a matter of criminological and sociological interest? What are the defining experiences and emotions associated with war and genocide?  How is killing in war framed or constructed in the minds of those who kill? What is mass killing/genocide and how is it accomplished and facilitated in war? Why is rape used so widely as a weapon in conflict situations and what is its lasting impact? What is genocide and how should it best be understood? How are atrocities in war denied, excused or rationalized? The aim of the module is to provide a framework for thinking about (1) the phenomenology of killing in war; (2) the conditions which facilitate genocide and mass killing at the state and sub state level; and (3) the ways in which perpetrators of mass killing, their apologists and distant others contrive to deny, rationalize or legitimize mass killing/genocide
