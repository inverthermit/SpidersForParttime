 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE310 - Modes of Reasoning

      
      
       One of the impediments to communication between different academic disciplines is their use of different ways of making, and validating, arguments and proofs. A key element of the programme in Liberal Arts is to develop a genuine inter-disciplinary approach so that students can understand, appreciate and assimilate the findings from diverse academic approaches.This module examines the varying modes of developing scientific, social scientific and humanities discourses to facilitate cross-disciplinary understanding of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. Following an introduction to Modes of Thought, engaging students with concepts of rationality as elaborated in logic and analytical reasoning, it will familiarise students in lectures and readings with quantitative and qualitative methodologies as well as with associated processes of data presentation, validation and conclusion reaching.Seminars will serve both to discuss and assess approaches and to familiarise students with working with techniques of data analysis and representation (quantitatively through statistical methods and software packages such as Excel and SPSS and qualitatively through sessions engaging grounded theory, narratology, actor network theory and image studies). Insofar as an element at the core of reasoning is representation per se, the issue of cognition and its unconscious shaping by both social and psychological forces will be addressed.Themes introduced here not only intertwine with teaching and practical exercises in the two concurrent first year core modules (for instance the training in research design, statistical methods, and data analysis carried out here will be drawn upon in Understanding the Contemporaries study of social and historical changes in local communities) but also recur throughout the rest of the programme. The cross-disciplinary debates  and communications  opened in this module will be revisited, and nuanced, over the following three years.The module Modes of Reasoning is rich in transferable skills training, helping students to develop numeric and analytical skills, engaging them in the formulation and design of research questions and hypotheses, and familiarising them with select software packages.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SE311 - Understanding the Contemporary

      
      
       Understanding the Contemporary will enable students to think critically about their own period, and analyse the forces and events shaping contemporary culture and society. Students will consider texts from a range of disciplines and will be selectively introduced to key ideas in contemporary theory and philosophy. They will furthermore apply insights drawn from their readings and discussions to practical analysis of contemporary situations, not only through developing awareness of current events but also through designing and carrying out field analysis of social and historical changes in local communities (linked both to the research plan designed in Modes of Reasoning and to SSPSSRs quantitative teaching methods programme).The focus of the module will be on the period since 2000, though clearly it will be necessary to reach back before that date to contextualise current issues. Students will be required to think critically about the ways different disciplines are formulating representations of the contemporary period, and to discuss themes and ideas that cross disciplines.Week by week, seminars and lectures will address topics that define the present period, for instance, migration, environmental change, financial crisis, democratic agency, and new media. The module will consider how different disciplines and intellectual traditions are responding to and framing such issues and developments so developing skills of comparative and cross-disciplinary reading.Overall, the module will develop multi-disciplinary understandings of the contemporary world and will encourage students to consider their role in shaping it.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE312 - Roots of Transformation

      
      
       The module will prepare students to think critically about the forces shaping ways of being in the contemporary world, with attention to how the modern has emerged from innovations and continuities in modes of production, reproduction and communication in the past two centuries.This module examines the technological and economic revolutions that shape human cultures, with a particular focus on the 19th and early 20th century roots of modernity and the impacts of recent and developing technological innovations. Students will be introduced to basic issues in scientific and technological developments impacting upon the contemporary world and will, building on their understanding of these, investigate their ramifications in social practices and ideations, in philosophical discourse and in the fields of aesthetic and literary production.Students will be required to think critically about the ways different disciplines respond to and are shaped by technological and social developments, and will be encouraged to engage these from a cross-disciplinary perspective.Overall, the module will develop multi-disciplinary understandings of the history of the contemporary world and will encourage students to become aware of, and to understand, the unseen influences which enable and constrain our ways of being so as to both work with them and, where appropriate, seek to shape them.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

Modules in stage one

Modes of Reasoning 1 - one of the impediments to communication between different academic disciplines is their uses of different ways of making, and validating, arguments and proofs. This module examines the varying modes of developing scientific, social scientific and humanities discourses to facilitate cross-disciplinary understanding of qualitative and quantitative reasoning.

Roots of Transformation - ways of thinking are shaped in often unseen ways by changes in the technologies we use to move, to communicate, to exchange and to create. This module examines the technological and economic revolutions that shape human cultures, with a particular focus both on the 19th and early 20th century roots of modernity and the impacts of recent and developing technological innovations on our ways of imagining ourselves and others.

Understanding the Contemporary - current events are shaped by a wide field of forces &ndash; economics, ideologies, demographics, environments and more. This module calls on students to be aware of current events and developments across a wide range of contexts and disciplines. It encourages multi-dimensional understandings of the contemporary world &ndash; from the perspective of the arts, the social sciences, history and politics &ndash; in order to gain a broad vision of the world and the means of conceptualising how to affect and change it.
