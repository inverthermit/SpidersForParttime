 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EN333 - Romanticism

      
      
       This year-long course examines some of the most significant writing of the Romantic period (1780-1830) - a period in which the role and forms of literature were being redefined - alongside recent debates in critical theory. You will study a wide range of literary texts from the poetry of Blake, Wordsworth and Keats to the novels of Jane Austen and Mary Shelley, with reference to contemporary literary and political debates and against the backdrop of the periods turbulent history. In parallel, this module explores fundamental critical questions about literature: Why read it? What is an author? What is the role of poetry in society? How is literature shaped by culture? What is Art? Continuities and disjunctions between Romantic writers answers to these questions and those provided by more recent literary theorists will be a central concern of the course.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LW313 - A Critical Introduction to Law

      
      
       The module will introduce students to critical legal techniques grounded in critical legal and social theory, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial theory and law and the humanities. Throughout the course, concepts are introduced through socio-legal and critical investigation of selected case studies - such as new pieces of legislation, emerging political campaigns and prominent litigation - ensuring that the course maintains a focus on law in action. Particular attention will be paid to developments in foreign jurisdictions and in the international arena. Accordingly, case studies will alter from year to year, and draw heavily on research projects on-going in the Law School. The course has a heavy focus on primary legal materials and core critical texts, but will also draw on film, museum artefacts, art and literature as appropriate.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LW315 - Introduction to Obligations

      
      
       This module introduces the law of obligations, which comprises the private law of duties and rights to which individuals and organisations are subject.  Traditionally, it includes the law of contract and tort (but not property). As well as introducing some of the content (which is covered more extensively in LW597 The Law of Obligations), a key focus is on the institution of the common law through which most of the law of obligations has emerged.  This aspect is especially explored through the case classes, which run alongside the lectures and seminars.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW316 - Foundations of Property

      
      
       Property is something we tend to presume we know about, and rarely examine as an idea or practice closely. Most often we use it to connote an object or thing, and presume that it has something to do with ownership of that object. It is so simple to say my property or this is mine. This module begins to unpack and examine the ideas and practices of property more closely: How are property claims constructed? What do we mean by ownership? What happens when a number of competing ownership claims in one object exist? When preparing for the module it will be useful to think about (and collect material on) current debates over contested ownership (or use) of property and resources: art collections or cultural artefacts, land or natural resources dispossessed, land squatted, etc. And why, in our jurisdiction in particular, has such a strong link been made between being a property owner (in this context a home-owner) and a good citizen.

      LW327 - The English Legal System and Skills

      
      
       Part A: English Legal SystemThis module provides an overview of the English Legal System, including the following indicative topics:1) An introduction to Parliament and the legislative process2) The court structure and the doctrine of precedent3) An introduction to case law, including how to identify and the importance of ratio decidendi and obiter dicta Part B: Introduction to Legal SkillsThe module also gives students an introduction to the basic legal skills that they will develop further in their other modules throughout the degree. The focus here is on specific exercises to support exploration and use of the library resources that are available, both in paper copy and electronically through the legal databases, and on understanding practices of legal citation.

       Credits: 4 credits (2 ECTS credits).

      EN302 - Early Drama

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of medieval and early modern dramatic genres, from ninth-century Latin church drama to the commercial theatres of Shakespeare's London. Students will learn about methods for analysing past performances and existing texts, as well as how drama interacted with and responded to pivotal moments in British history, and the culture, politics and religion of the period.  As such, the module will function as an introduction to medieval and early modern studies more broadly and a platform from which to undertake early English literature and drama modules, such as Chaucer and Late Medieval Literature, Early Modern Literature, 1500-1700 and Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama, at Stages 2 and 3.  Students will read and discuss playtexts in modern translations, both as literary objects and live performance events. Regular optional site visits and screenings will contribute to students understanding of the dramas contexts, how plays might work in performance and to what extent they still speak to twenty-first century audiences. Lectures and seminars are designed to be varied and interactive, with the opportunity for everyone to participate and to develop key academic skills. The module is assessed by seminar contributions, creative and research-based coursework and a final end-of-year project, which will allow students the freedom to explore a topic of their choice creatively.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN331 - Readings in the Twentieth Century

      
      
       This module emphasizes the links between literature, history, and culture. It introduces students to the formative events, debates and struggles of the twentieth century, and how these have been addressed by different modes of creative and critical writing. Topics such as the First World War, Modernism, the Holocaust, the US culture industry, postcolonial studies, as well as 9/11, will be considered and discussed in relation to fictional and critical literature, films, photography, graphic novels, music, and other media. Weekly screenings will run alongside lectures and seminar discussions. Literary works across all genres will be read in relation to visual material  such as paintings, photography, various feature and documentary films, etc  and a range of selected critical reading. The majority of writing samples are drawn from English, American and more broadly anglophone writing, though several instances of writing in other languages will also be included (all taught in translation).

      EN332 - Writing America

      
      
       This module aims to emphasize connections between literature and culture in the USA, from early considerations of a distinct American literature to the present day. By way of six key themes or preoccupations, the module will introduce students to some of the major debates and antagonisms, and rhetorical and stylistic modes, that have formed and modified American literary and intellectual culture Questions of Belief, Gender, Race, Economy, Space, and Time will be approached through a range of textual forms set against their historical contexts and within the broader nexus of cultural production including the visual performing arts where appropriate. Students will be encouraged to examine the specific local, regional, and national frameworks within which these texts are produced, but also to look at the ways in which they resist and transcend national boundaries, in the development of an American register in world literatures for instance. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      LW597 - The Law of Obligations

      
      
       This module builds on LW315 An Introducton to Obligations by examining in more depth the grounds of liability in contract and tort.  The focus on reading cases is retained with regular case classes, and this is supplemented by a focus on legislation where relevant as well as theoretical material.

      LW598 - Equity and Trusts

      
      
       This module, normally taken in Stage 2, introduces the student to the main principles and doctrines of equity and trusts. It is designed to challenge the somewhat dull image of this area of law and to encourage a critical and imaginative understanding of the subject. The law of equity and trusts is contextualized within a historical, social and jurisprudential inquiry thereby providing a much wider range of possible interpretations of its development and application. What then becomes central to the modules approach is the complex interrelation of law with ethical, political, economic and jurisprudential considerations, and that between legal outcomes, pragmatic concerns and policy objectives. Drawing upon the students experience of the study of law, in particular that gained from Foundations of Property Law and Property Law, this module examines the trust both as a private legal institution (the trust in family and commercial settings) and a public one (the charitable trust), placing special emphasis on the management of the trust and the powers, duties and obligations of the trustee. Yet in departing from conventional approaches this module does not study equity merely in regards to its role as the original creator of the trust. Equity is instead acknowledged to be what it really is - a vital and fruitful component of the English legal system; a distinct form of legal interpretation possessing its own principles and method of legal reasoning, and comprising an original and continuing source of legal development in the sphere of remedies.

      LW599 - Land Law

      
      
       The focus of the module is private property in English land: title by registration; squatting; owner-occupation; leases; covenants and land development. It builds on the Foundations of Property module to develop an in-depth understanding of English land law, its conception of property and its politics and effects. And it gives experience in how to advise clients on land law problems  and on how to avoid problems for clients.

      EN681 - Novelty, Enlightenment and Emancipation: 18th Century Literature

      
      
       Before 1660 there was no English novel, and by the end of the eighteenth century there was Jane Austen. This module asks how such a literary revolution was possible. It investigates the rise of professional authorship in an increasingly open marketplace for books. With commercial expansion came experiment and novelty. Genres unheard of in the Renaissance emerged for the first time: they include the periodical essay, autobiography, the oriental tale, amatory fiction, slave narratives and, most remarkably, the modern novel. Ancient modes such as satire, pastoral and romance underwent surprising transformations. Many eighteenth-century men and women felt that they lived in an age of reason and emancipation  although others warned of enlightenments darker aspect. Seminar reading reflects the fact that an increasing number of women, members of the labouring classes, and African slaves wrote for publication; that readers themselves became more socially varied; and that Britain was growing to understand itself as an imperial nation within a shifting global context. It asks students to reflect, as eighteenth-century writers did, upon the literary, cultural and political implications of these developments

      EN692 - Early Modern Literature 1500-1700

      
      
       This module offers a survey of early modern literature from 1500 to 1700. Looking at a wide range of literature including poetry, prose and drama, students will consider the relationship between literary debate and form on the one hand, and political change, social identity and religious transformation on the other. We will consider how important debates surrounding political, social, gender and religious identity inflect and are reflected in the literature of the period, including works by Baldwin, Donne, Lanyer, Marvell, Milton and Behn. Students will also explore the boundaries of the literary canon, encountering pamphlets, sermons and conduct books, and consider the ways in which literary and non-literary texts both mirror and influence culture and society.

      EN694 - Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama

      
      
       The drama of early modern England broke new literary and dramatic ground. This module will focus on key plays across the period, exploring the development of dramatic writing, playing companies home within the London theatres, dramas links to court entertainment and its relationship to the provinces. Dramatic and literary form will be a central preoccupation alongside issues of characterisation, culture, politics and gender. Shakespeares work will be put into context in relation to the plays of contemporary dramatists as well as the various cultural, historical and material circumstances that influenced the composition, performance and publication of drama in early modern England.

      EN697 - Chaucer and Late Medieval English Literature

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of writing from the late medieval period.  It will focus on a number of central genres in English literature that emerge between the late fourteenth and early sixteenth centuries (from romance, tragedy and fabliaux through to morality plays and devotional prose) and will explore some key topics and themes in medieval literature, such as authority, gender, sexuality, piety, chivalric identity, narrative and voice, truth and destiny.  Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales will offer an accessible introduction to these core genres and themes, and initiate students in issues that are pertinent to less familiar writers and texts from the period, such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Malorys Le Morte Darthur, and The Book of Margery Kempe.  During the course of the module you will also learn about the historical and cultural contexts of the fourteenth, fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and how such contexts influenced the literature of the period.The themes and theories covered by the course will vary in response to the lecture programme and the emphasis and research specialisms of individual teachers.  Previous topics have included: gender and sexuality; authorship and patronage; history of the book; manuscripts and the printed texts; piety and devotion; iconography; social relations; performance cultures; audience, reading and reception; the body, corporeality and experience.

      EN695 - Empire, New Nations and Migration

      
      
       This course will introduce students to the field of postcolonial literature, focusing on the period from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The course will be divided into three consecutive areas: empire and colonisation; the processes of decolonisation; and migration and diaspora. Centred primarily on canonical British colonial texts, the first part of the course will explore issues surrounding language, cosmopolitan encounters, Orientalism, modernism and the genres of imperial fantasy. The texts in the second part of the module will be drawn from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. The intention is to allow students to bring these disparate regions and texts into a productive dialogue by reflecting on their common engagement with colonial and liberation discourses, as well as the legacies of partition. The course further aims to sketch a narrative of empire and decolonisation that links these issues to the context of narrating migration in our contemporary postcolonial world, a subject taken up more directly in the final part of the course.Some brief extracts from critical material on colonial discourse and history, decolonisation, postcoloniality and migration will be considered alongside the primary text each week. Together with a broad primary textual arc that stretches from the British empire to the contemporary metropolis, the course will give students a coherent intellectual narrative with which to explore changing conceptions of culture, history and postcolonial identity across the modern world.

      EN677 - The Contemporary

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of contemporary literature written in English, where contemporary is taken to refer to twenty-first century work. It will equip students with critical ideas and theoretical concepts that will help them to understand the literature of their own time. Students will consider examples of a range of genres: poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction and the essay. They will also be selectively introduced to key ideas in contemporary theory and philosophy. Over the course of the module, students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts. They will consider writers responses to, for instance, questions of migration, environmental change, and financial crisis. They will also consider a range of aesthetic developments and departures, for example: new conceptualism and the claim to unoriginality; the turn to creative non-fiction; the re-emergence of the political essay. The module will not focus on a given national context. Instead it will set contemporary writing against the background of identifiably international issues and concerns. In so doing it will draw attention to non-national publishing strategies and audiences. Overall, the module will aim to show how writers are responding to the present period, how their work illuminates and reflects current cultural concerns. The module will alternate, week by week, between thematic and formal concerns.

      EN689 - Modernism

      
      
       This module features key modernist texts, for example the work of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D., Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys. It also makes substantial reference to key philosophical theories of modernity and textuality. The literary works are taken mostly from a restricted period 1910-1939. Other texts which might form part of the curriculum may include a limited selection of works by F.T. Marinetti, Mina Loy, D.H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Samuel Beckett, Mikhail Bakhtin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Derrida. One focus in the module will be the notion of the artist as applied to the writer as an art-practitioner. Other topics include modes of representation, textuality and identity, the relationship between language and experience, war and democracy, class and politics, notions of exile, cosmopolitanism and bohemianism, sex, morality and city life. This material requires both theoretical and historical orientation, as well as skill in distilling significance from complex literary artefacts with regard to the network of mediations which both bind such works to their apparent context and appear to dislocate them.

      EN672 - Reading Victorian Literature

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of Victorian literature. It will equip students with critical ideas that will help them become more skilful and confident readers of texts in and beyond this period. Students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts: environmental (for example, considering the effects of urbanisation and the Industrial Revolution); imaginative (examining a range of genres such as poetry, novel, short story); political (class conflicts, changing gender roles, ideas of nation and empire); and psychological (representations of sexuality, parent-child relationships, madness, dreams). Students will be made aware of concepts such as modernity and will be encouraged to think about various developments of literary form in the period.

      EN675 - Declaring Independence: 19th Century US Literature

      
      
       When the Long Island-born poet Walt Whitman proclaimed in 1855 that the United States were historys greatest poem he made an important connection between national political culture and literary expression. In some ways this was no exaggeration. As a new experiment in politics and culture, the United States had to be literally written into existence. Beginning with Thomas Jeffersons dramatic Declaration of Independence in 1776, followed by the drafting of the Constitution after the Revolutionary War with Britain, the project of shaping the new United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was essentially a literary one.  In this module we will explore how American writers in this period tried in numerous, diverse ways to locate an original literary voice through which to express their newfound independence. At the same time, the module includes the work of writers who had legitimate grievances against the developing character of a new nation that still saw fit to cling to such Old World traditions as racialized slavery, class conflict and gender inequality.

      LW589 - The Skills of Argument - How to Argue and Win

      
      
       Argument occurs across the full spectrum of human interaction - in pubs, at home, in seminar classes, and in professional contexts such as those provided by law, science and medicine. However, despite the importance allotted to argument and the desire of those engaged in arguments to win them, little systematic attention is given to the nature of argument and the practical skills required to argue successfully, even though this information is readily available. The ambition of the module is to equip students with this knowledge base and skills, thereby enabling them to enter into argument more confidently and with a greater prospect of success.  The module divides into three parts, the first being a very brief historical and theoretical contextualisation of the topic. The second part of the module treats argument and arguing formally, by mapping the standard forms of argument and by developing the skill of picking out a bad argument from a good one, and by showing how to spot the set of common but typically unnoticed mistakes in ones own argument or in those of others. The third part of the module turns to the skills of rhetoric and persuasion, including examination of the ploys that are often used to give bad or weak arguments persuasive force. The themes of the module are illustrated throughout using real examples from law and elsewhere.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW591 - Family Law

      
      
       This module focuses on the way the law regulates the creation and breakdown of families and relationship between parents, children and the state.  Topics will include marriage and civil partnerships, domestic violence, divorce and post-separation arrangements for property and children, legal parenthood and parental responsibility, child protection and adoption.There is no prescribed preliminary reading, but the following may be of interest to those who wish to undertake some pre-reading.Due to frequent changes in the law in this area, textbooks tend to go out of date, and new editions are published quite frequently.  The assigned textbook will be notified at the commencement of the module.

      LW594 - Skills in Legal Interpretation

      
      
       90% of English cases involve a statute. For obvious reasons, it is crucial that you should know how to interpret and apply a statute. Through a series of fascinating examples both from the UK and elsewhere, this module teaches you these skills, which all employers highly value. Skills in interpretation are also very useful when you have to deal with judicial precedents. This module will make a difference on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;!

      LW596 - Gender, Sexuality and Law

      
      
       The media is full of gender controversies: theres same-sex marriage (or not) in California, violence against women pretty well everywhere, and a whopping 17% gender pay gap in the UK. What do you think about these issues? How do you think the law should respond? This module focuses on how law interacts with gender and sexuality. It examines, and encourages you to discuss, the interconnections between law, policy, gender, and sexuality. We will start by focusing on key concepts in feminist and queer legal theory, such as heteronormativity (the dominance of heterosexual family and social structures).  We will then relate these theories to current dilemmas: same-sex marriage; transgender rights; gay refugees; diverse family formations. Finally, we tackle the really big questions. Should we use the law to change the law? Are rights really any use? What is neo-liberalism and how does this relate to gender?

      LW600 - Law, Science and Technology

      
      
       Science and technology play a significant part in the way law operates in contemporary states. This plays out at several levels: law is turned to in order regulate scientific and technological developments, and in so doing helps societies shape their futures; science and technologies are frequently used in providing the basis of legal decisions, and experts play an increasing part in decision-making, in courts and in governance. Both law and science, however, are complex social fields, and understanding their interaction requires careful theoretical and methodological tools. In this module, we interrogate some of these interactions, by exploring conceptual tools from several disciplines (including socio-legal studies, science and technology studies and anthropology), and applying them to particular case studies, including: the regulation of reproductive technologies; evidence in the courtroom; the governance of climate change; intellectual property and access to medicines; law and psychiatry; technological disasters and citizenship. This module is likely to be of interest to those students who particularly enjoyed LW592 Public Law II.

      LW624 - Labour Law

      
      
       This module is concerned with contemporary labour law. It combines legal analysis and the transmission of practical legal skills with a highly contextual and interdisciplinary understanding of the labour law and regulatory debates around labour regulation. To that end, workshops will feature extended discussion on key aspects of contemporary labour legislation using scholarly texts.. Students will also study key legal aspects of the modern employment relationship including the contract of employment, statutory employment protection provisions (for example unfair dismissal and redundancy protection), anti-discrimination legislation and provisions for reconciling work and family life (e.g. pregnancy protection and parental leave). The module will also explore selected aspects of collective labour law including the role and status of trade unions, the legal regulation of collective bargaining and/or the regulation of industrial conflict. The module seeks to combine a detailed  knowledge of fundamental key aspects of labour law with the development of broader conceptual, critical and evaluative perspectives on workplace regulation.

      LW626 - Appropriate Dispute Resolution: Theory and   Practice

      
      
       In recent times, alternative forms of dispute resolution (ADR) have been widely recognised as possessing the potential to limit some of the damage caused by civil disputes. Therefore, a lawyers skill-set ideally should include a well-developed ability to analyse, manage and resolve disputes both within and outside the usual setting of the courtroom. Thus, the modules primary aim is to introduce students to the legal and regulatory issues surrounding methods of dispute resolution aside from litigation. Specifically, the module focuses on the practical factors relevant to selecting appropriate dispute resolution in distinct circumstances, including, for example, the employment and family law arenas.  Students will be provided with the resources to acquire a detailed theoretical and practical understanding of the contextual constraints associated with the use of different forms of dispute resolution and will be encouraged to develop their ability to evaluate the effectiveness of particular interventions, especially when used as an adjunct to court proceedings. The module tracks historic and current developments in relation the use of ADR, highlighting how government policy and courts appear, increasingly, to sanction failure to use ADR. This may well enhance students opportunities to hone career-advancing expertise in the field.  

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW583 - Art Law

      
      
       This module studies the development of Art law which has been shaped by a complex relationship between artists, dealers, auction houses, collectors, museums and the State. It has emerged from civil law, property law, criminal law, public law, private international law and public international law. It is regulated by a superposition of international treaties, European texts and national laws. Those different interactions have developed a less than coherent Art Law framework that will be comparatively analysed by reference to English, European and International Law. Topics to be discussed are (1) the definition of art in relation to law, cultural property, copyright and pornography (2) the actors of the market: the artist (his rights on the work of art, his freedom of creation and its limits), the dealers (dealers and auction houses), the expert and the collector (3) the sale of works of art: authenticity and counterfeit art, transfer of ownership of stolen art (4) the illicit trade of works of art in time of war (looting, spoliation during World War II) and in time of peace: conflicting national/European/international rules on the restitution of illegally exported, excavated and/or stolen works of art (5) museums: the legal character and obligations, staff, de-accession and (6) the role of the State: a non-neutral actor in the protection and support of art and the artists.

       Please note: You do not need to have studied maths, science or probabilities to perform well on this module!Forensic evidence is a rapidly developing area in criminal trials  new techniques are continually being developed and forensic evidence such as DNA profiling is increasingly presented as evidence. This rapid expansion has resulted in forensic evidence becoming increasingly debated in the media and by the criminal justice process  from articles hailing DNA profiling as preventing or undoing miscarriages of justice to those questioning a lay jurys ability to make a judgement in case involving highly complex scientific or medical evidence. This module considers how the criminal justice system makes use of forensic science. Initially, analysis of the relevant rules of evidence will be made alongside a broad overview of forensic science in the courtroom.  This is then built upon through an exploration of case law and consideration of topical questions such as who should decide whether a new scientific technique should be admissible evidence, who are the experts who present the evidence to juries and the extent to which the admission of forensic evidence assists juries.

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

       Environmental Law II builds upon the themes introduced in Environmental Law I whilst placing central emphasis upon the environmental and ecological implications of land use and development, and the regulation of land use activities to secure protection of biodiversity. The module commences with some cross-cutting issues, encompassing civil liability for environmental harms and human rights in respect of the environment, before turning to consideration of regimes for restricting land use to prevent unacceptable kinds of environmental and ecological harm. This involves looking at land use development controls in national law and European Community requirements for environmental assessment of projects and plans to anticipate and mitigate the environmental impacts of development. This leads into a discussion of laws that are more specifically concerned with the protection of species and habitats, either through direct restrictions upon destructive activities or through legal mechanisms to secure biodiversity conservation through designation and management of land that is of ecological importance. In respect of each topic, the object is to place discussion of national and European Community laws into context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving environmentally and ecologically appropriate land use and conservation of biodiversity, and ultimately sustainable development.

       Students on this module must become members of the Kent Law Clinic, and work under Supervisors on live cases for clients of the Clinic under the supervision of solicitors, or other experienced legal practitioners working alongside them. All Supervisors are members of the academic staff at Kent Law School. Students will develop their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of English law and procedure, and some specific skills. Students are encouraged to view their clinical work as a means to an end  not just the acquisition of important legal skills but primarily a better understanding and critical analysis of law and of legal practice. The excellent opportunity which clinical work provides for active learning, and for studying the interface between theory and practice, is placed firmly in this context.Students are expected to undertake from the second week of Autumn term onwards until the end of the Spring term, under supervision, the conduct of at least two substantial cases (or the equivalent), involving proceedings in courts or tribunals or other legal forums, or projects on an area of law of  relevance to the objects of the Clinic. Students will normally work on cases rather than projects. A Supervisor will decide whether a student has undertaken two substantial cases (or the equivalent) for the purposes of this module.

       The aim of the module is to provide a basic introduction to the common characteristics which underpin the European (continental) legal systems with the object of providing students (particularly those on all of the four year European degree programmes) with a foundation upon which they can develop a more substantial knowledge of a continental jurisdiction. It will aim to provide a general grounding in the history, culture and mentality of the European legal systems and as such will focus upon the historical foundations, the institutional development and the methodological traditions. The starting point and foundation of the module will be the university tradition stemming from the rediscovery of Roman law in the 11th century and the development and transformation of this tradition over the subsequent centuries into the perceived axiomatic structure at one time thought to underpin the codes. Particular attention will be given to the French and German systems and contemporary developments within these systems will form the final part of the module.

      LW556 - Intellectual Property Law

      
      
       This module will examine the main forms or types of intellectual property (IP) rights: copyright, patents and trade marks (as well as the related topics of passing off and breach of confidence) that embody the notion of privatising the intangible fruits of the mind. About each of these IP forms, we will ask: what are the procedural requirements required for its creation as IP? Who is the owner of the IP and why is he/she the owner? What are the various rights given to the rights-holder? What constitutes IP infringement? What are the remedies available for IP infringement? But this is not an exclusively doctrinal module and we will continually look at pressing policy questions such as: why should we protect IP? How important is continuing access to the public domain? Should plants be the subject of a patent? Do employees get short-changed by the presumptions of IP law? Particular topics will vary from year to year, but may include copyright issues on the Internet, the impact of patents and copyright on socio-economic development in the global South, and questions such as: should musical parodies be permitted? Who benefits from IP? Should human genes be patentable? Should greater protection be given to whistleblowers? The focus will be on UK IP law, but we will regularly examine relevant EU directives and global IP treaties. The aim is not to provide a crash course in all aspects of intellectual property doctrine, but rather to examine a range of important practical and theoretical questions about a form of property that some commentators have called "the new wealth" of the 21st century.

      LW570 - Law and Social Change

      
      
       This module aims to investigate the relationship between law, morality, and social change, and how this relationship has changed and may change over time.  In other words, it seeks responses to questions such as the following: How does law produce morality and morality produce law? What is the role of moral norms and obligation in legal practice? How does the character of law shift in response to social struggle? Why, if some modern social theories allow for the recognition of a vastly reduced number of valid norms, is moral discourse still the default mechanism for resolving conflicts in society? Has moral discourse been supplanted by other means of conflict resolution and social integration? How might we envision an ideal moral-legal framework?Typically its content will include: The meanings of law and social changeClassical Social Theory, law and Social ChangeContemporary social theory, law and social changeThe Hart/Devlin Debate: Law, Disgust, and Social ChangePositive approaches to the promotion of Social Change Feminism and Legal ReformThe Legal Profession and Social ChangeRights and citizenship

       This module focuses on governance, regulation, norm-maintenance and rule non-compliance within communities and institutions. It provides a distinct perspective to general questions of law, socio-legal theory, and jurisprudence. Key questions include: when do norms count as law? How do communities govern themselves, and what role do law and social norms play in this process? What authority do intentional communities possess when it comes to rule-breaking? What is the relationship between community rules and state law? Can communities function without rules? And is institutional law-breaking (or non-compliance) analogous to individual disobedience? Topics include: legal pluralism and legal consciousness, Foucault and governmentality, norm-following among strangers, etiquette within public sex communities, virtual worlds, governing through local currencies, nudism, self-regulation in a free school, and Speakers Corner.

      LW578 - Law and Political Theory

      
      
       This module will examine contemporary political and juridical problems by drawing on political theory in relation to sovereignty, law, and violence.  For instance, the notion of sovereignty is central to what is regarded as legitimate and illegitimate violence.  What is the difference, in political and juridical terms, between a young soldier who sacrifices her/his life for the nation and a suicide bomber whose death and dying also has a political agenda? How can institutional and legalised violence such as colonialism or apartheid be dealt with by individuals and social orders? Classical and contemporary political theory can help us to address such questions.  It will thus examine concepts and theories of sovereignty, community, and the individual subject.  Key texts of modern political theory, such as the writings of Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Schmitt will be considered. Contemporary theorists such as Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Talal Asad, and Veena Das will also be examined. The module will also draw on novels and film to explore the relationship between freedom and violence, suffering and memory, The examination of Case Studies will give students the opportunity to examine and understand the significance of political theory for dealing with contemporary legal issues and problems such as: terrorism, refugees, postcolonial law, war on terror, sovereignty in the EU, and Empire.

       Consumer law and policy is a significant area of current UK and European Union market regulation. This module initially discusses the rationales for consumer law and the different forms of regulating consumer markets. We then look at topics such as deceptive and unfair advertising, standard form consumer contracts, consumer credit law, quality standards in the supply of goods and services, product safety, consumer redress and access to justice. Consumer law cuts across traditional doctrinal boundaries of private and public law and provides an opportunity for analysing a variety of forms of regulation such as private law, public regulation and enforcement, co-regulation, soft law, shaping market values, and harnessing market incentives.

      LW581 - Law and Literature

      
      
       So much of law is about text and the manipulation of language: Becoming sensitive to the construction of narratives in judgements, learning to read argument in its many forms, recognising the ways in which words, and patterns of words, can be used to create effect, playing with ambiguities or seeking to express an idea with clarity, all these are fundamental skills for a lawyer. Law is also about performance, the roles which are assigned to us and the drama of the court room. And law, as text and performance, carries fundamental cultural messages about the society we live in and the values we aspire to. During this module, we will examine some of the many ways in which reading, viewing and listening to, the arts helps us to think more concisely as well as more imaginatively about law. Our preliminary reading list is longer than usual, it is designed to give prospective students a taste of the range of material we will cover, as well as to suggest that it will be helpful to have undertaken some preliminary work before starting the module. We welcome on to the module anyone who shares, with us, an enjoyment of reading, viewing and listening  this is a chance to be introduced to material you may not be familiar with as well as a chance to pursue an interest you may already have. Although the module is designed primarily for law students, it is also open to undergraduates from other degree programmes.

      LW604 - Morality and Law

      
      
       This course will give students the opportunity to explore the ways in which morality has been understood and theorised and then to trace the development of a particular moral concept (namely, that of individual rights), that is central to legal discourse today. The methodology will be historical/contextual as well as theoretical/analytical. We will look at the way in which the idea of individual rights arose (and continues to develop) in a philosophical, political and historical context and we will examine and critically evaluate modern theories of rights and their relationship to law. The concept of a right is deceptively simple. When examined closely is gives rise to all sorts of questions and problems including, for example: how is the idea of a right justified? What is its relationship to the older idea of liberty? Can it survive the discrediting of theories of natural rights tied to natural law? Can it stand alone as a moral concept or is it merely the other side of a duty?Block 1: A critical introduction to the major theories of moral philosophy: virtue theory, duty based (deontological) Kantian theory and consequentialism (utilitarianism). Block 2:. A historical/contextual examination of the development of a particular moral concept; that of individual rights. Block 3.Oral presentations by students in pairs.Block 4.An analytical examination and critique of modern theories of rights and their relationship to law (incl. interest and will theories and the legal analysis of Wesley Hohfeld)

In this course we will critically explore what development means, and we will examine different approaches to understanding the role that law plays in achieving development. Weeks 1-4 will introduce theories of development, the main international development institutions and the international context in which they developed, and different approaches to law and development.Weeks 5-10 will cover specific topics in law and development, including (but not limited to) campaigns to secure a right to development; land reform; poverty and aid; gender issues in law and development; law-building in post-conflict contexts; creating legal institutions; corruption and development; and the relationship between human rights and rule of law in development debates.

      LW617 - Legal Ethics: Exploring the Ethics of Lawyersand Lawyering

      
      
       This course will give students the opportunity to explore the ways in which moral reasoning can inform the study and practice of lawyering.  Students will be asked to think and argue about the (possible) moral dimension of the practice of law. The course will include a theoretical component during which we will explore ways in which we might justify (or deny) a moral dimension to the practice of law. In the practical component we will use case studies (including that of the US government lawyers who provided legal justifications for the use of torture on War on Terror prisoners). This case study and others will be used to discuss and debate issues in legal ethics, broadly conceived. The methodology will combine theoretical discussion of the principles that should inform the notion of legal ethics with analysis and discussion of actual moral and ethical dilemmas faced by lawyers and their resolution.Block 1: Why Legal Ethics? An exploration of the moral reasoning and arguments behind the idea of legal ethics. Do lawyers have moral responsibilities as well as legal ones? Block 2: Case studies and the ethical issues they raise. Answers to moral questions and dilemmas in legal practice.

      LW507 - Critical Legal Theory

      
      
       Are you interested in critical approaches to law? Critical Legal Theory can help! This module introduces you to major concepts, questions and perspectives that are important for a critical engagement with the problem of law in contemporary life. The modules first aim is to build your vocabulary of critical legal concepts, which will deepen your engagement with law and legal problems. What does it mean to be critical? How can law aim for justice? Is law still authoritative? What qualifies as a legal text in contemporary society? How can we use understandings of sovereignty, judgment or the nature of government to critically analyse contemporary law? In the second term, we will apply these critical legal perspectives to a range of contemporary problems and situations. Examples might include biotechnology, facebook and social media, theoretical questions in governance and regulation, political protest, films and other popular cultural forms, human rights, social equality, terrorism and counter-terrorism, torture, the casualized workforce, and the plight of the refugee. Contemporary critical legal theory comes in many varieties and draws on many disciplines, and this module introduces you to a range of major approaches. Students will be able to focus their research essay on any substantive or theoretical area.

      LW520 - Company Law and Capitalism

      
      
       This module seeks not only to familiarise students with the basic concepts and structure of modern British company law, but also to provide them with a critical understanding of the nature and dynamics of modern capitalism and of the historical development of industrial organisation and the emergence of company law within it. In addition to a selection on modern company law, therefore, the module also traces the rise of the joint stock company in the nineteenth century and the emergence of company law in its wake. It moves on to trace the twentieth century rise of the modern multidivisional, multinational company and its impact on company law. In this context, it also considers the nature of the share and of shareholding, and the role of the Stock Market, and explores contemporary debates about corporate governance. Key aspects will include exploring the contractual relations between, on the one hand, the company and its agents and on the other hand, third parties who deal with the company, tracing the evolutionary changes from the Common Law to the modern predominantly statutory framework. It will also deal with aspects of corporate management and control, including directors duties, shareholders rights and the increasingly important issues pertaining to market abuse and how the law seeks to deal with such practices. Students are encouraged to familiarise themselves with current issues in the commercial world by reading the financial pages of the newspapers, as reference will frequently be made to current events to facilitate the learning process. The module will address a range of inter-related questions: How well suited is modern company law to the regulation of the large modern corporation? What do shareholders do? What does the Stock Market do? In whose interests are modern corporations run?  In whose interest should they be run? How do companies contract and what are the relationships between the organs of the company?

      LW522 - Comparative Law

      
      
       In the current context of globalization, postcolonialism and transnationalism, not to mention the Europeanization of laws, every law student in the UK will almost inevitably encounter foreign law in the course of his or her professional life. For one thing, the legislator shows itself more and more open to the influence of foreign legal ideas in the legislative process. Also, appellate judges increasingly refer to foreign law in the course of their opinions. Further, private parties often enter into legal arrangements, such as contracts or wills, presenting an international dimension. In sum, nowadays, foreign law is everywhere and cannot be circumvented. This module intends to provide law students with the necessary intellectual equipment allowing them to approach any foreign law (not only European laws) in a meaningful way. In particular, the module will heighten students sensitization to the specificity of foreign legal cultures and encourage them to reflect in depth upon the possibilities and limits of cross-border interaction in the law. Another feature of this module will be a critical introduction to hermeneutics, deconstruction and translation studies with specific reference being made to law as these lines of thought are most relevant for comparatists. Throughout the course, concrete examples will be developed from a range of different national laws. No prior knowledge of foreign law or of a foreign language is required.

       The Philosophy of Law is a module designed for those who are interested in all kinds of reflective speculation about law. What is law for? Should we value it? Should we obey it? What is its relation to justice, to morality and to politics? The module is divided into two parts; the first to takes the form of an examination of the major schools in legal philosophy that continue to have influence today, the second is a close, critical reading of a single work in the subject.

       London became a metropolis in the sixteenth century  it grew wildly in size and its big city status made it the entertainment capital of England. This module analyses the relationship between a developing city and an expanding cultural life in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. It considers the increase in playhouses, shopping, street life, religious life and public shaming. It explores the dynamics between urban life and writing  the way Londoners wrote about their city, the way satirists punctured its self-image, the way courts recorded its crimes and the way entertainment was scripted. It investigates the interplay between spontaneous popular culture and structured civic entertainment, and between court culture and prostitution. Topics to be covered include mapping the city: Stowes Survey; working London: street cries and the water poet; street performances: sermons and book burnings; women on the margins: cony catching and prostitution; and shopping in London: the new exchange and its plays.

       This module will examine the interactions between Britons and the world beyond Europe during the eighteenth century and the different sites of exchange and domination, as well as hybrid cultural articulations, that emerged from these interactions.  We will look at a variety of texts that depict non-European people and places, as well as texts that were read by Britons and written by foreign and colonial peoples, to assess critically the transnational and transatlantic understanding and influences of the period.  We will explore topics such as Cosmopolitanism in the Eighteenth Century, Foreign Influence on British Identity, The Material Culture of Empire, and Transatlantic Culture.  Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the postcolonial study of eighteenth-century literature and the ethical and political implications of these texts and the ways in which we choose to approach them.

      EN703 - The 'Real' America: Class and Culture in the American Gilded Age

      
      
       What is at stake when artists and writers decide to take the real world as the subject of their art? In the later nineteenth century, to depict reality in fiction and art became a radical act of social protest and critique. In an endeavour to locate the truth behind American society, realists moved well beyond pre-existing societal norms to investigate the squalid living conditions of immigrants in the New York slums, participate in Native American religious ceremonies, and probe the psychosexual neuroses of the middle classes. This module explores the American ideology of realism (Michael Elliot) in the late nineteenth- and early- twentieth centuries as expressed in a variety of forms and genres, including: the novel, painting, anthropology and photography. We will discuss the reasons behind the emergence of realism in the later nineteenth century, how it interacted with the new mass culture, whether it critiqued or reinforced dominant racial, sexual, ethnic and class-based prejudices, and, finally, why it declined in the twentieth century as the favoured aesthetic of the American avant-garde. On this module we will move far beyond seeing realism as merely a tame, neutral artistic style to investigate how it pointed to a radical way of seeing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century world. The module includes only 3 longer works (Wharton, Howells, and Mooney).

      EN704 - Discord and Devotion: Society & Spirituality in Middle English Literatu

      
      
       This module will introduce students to late-medieval models of social order and, against these official representations, explore how established concepts of identity and social status were debated, destabilized and renegotiated.  Through analysing texts such as William Langlands Piers Plowman, the letters of John Ball, Chaucers Canterbury Tales, selected lyrics and a variety of historiographical texts, the course will investigate the ways in which attempts to control social movement were challenged and contested.  In a period in which traditional feudal social structures were being supplanted by an emergent proto-capitalist economy, the lower orders were demanding a new political platform and English literature reveals both social aspirations and reactionary anxieties.In parallel with the political tumult, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries also saw a rise in non-official, heterodox forms of spirituality, licensing individual devotional practices that similarly challenged the perceived hegemony of the Church.  Investigating works of affective devotion, like The Book of Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwichs Revelations of Divine Love, and a variety of religious lyrics and plays, in addition to Wycliffite and Lollard sermons, the module will uncover the growing popularity of devotional forms predicated upon a personal relationship with and experience of the divine.  These practices (like their political counterparts) decentred spiritual authority and reveal a theological ambition which problematised orthodox religion in multiple ways.  Within these reimagined visions of social and religious structures are the seeds of new ideas that would shape the future of the English nation; in such visions the common man gains power and authority, women are empowered as spiritual leaders, and the authority of Church and State is subject to lay criticism and intervention.

      EN705 - The Contemporary Memoir

      
      
       Why is the memoir such a popular genre in contemporary literature? Are memoirs individualistic, sentimental and voyeuristic (what is often dismissed as misery literature) or can they have strong ethical impulses and powerful real-world effects? This course critically examines the significance of the memoir  a first-person account of a part of ones life, often written by someone not previously known as a writer in late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century literature. Through reading a range of recent memoirs we will examine the themes, techniques and debates that have come to characterise this genre. Drawing on a range of aesthetic, theoretical and cultural perspectives, we will approach these memoirs both as literature  as rich sources for critical analysis and capable of transforming academic criticism  and in terms of their appeal, and sometimes controversial reception, within present-day mass audiences.  We will also expand our discussion of memoirs to consider graphic narrative and film.

      EN706 - The Love Poem: Wyatt to Nick Cave

      
      
       The Love Poem will tell a history of English poetry through the lens of its most important and singular genre. Students will interrogate the characteristics of modern poetry itself through an investigation of love, desire, gender and intimacy as they have been articulated through the changing lyrical tradition of the language. The module will examine key canonical writers from the beginnings of the English lyric, including Thomas Wyatt and William Shakespeare, through complications in metaphysical poetry, the ballad and Romanticism, up to present day representations of homosexual love, popular song and avant-garde expression. Poets will be studied alongside theorists such as Alain Badiou, Roland Barthes and Henri Bergson, exploring the possible ways in which poetry can be said to challenge dominant modes of love, interact with their social environment through love poetry, and investigate, express and explain the experiences of attraction, attachment and loss.

       What is the relationship between animal and human, and how is this explored through writing? This module seeks to examine creaturely relations by focusing on literature from the 18th century up to the present, alongside key theoretical and contextual material that engages with questions concerning animality and humanity. We will focus on how writers imagine distinct animal worlds as well as how they understand the role of animals in human cultures. A range of novels, short stories and poems will raise questions about how we look at, think with, and try to give voice to animals, and topics covered will include Becoming Animal, Listening to Animals, Animal Experiments' and Tasting Animals. Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the diverse critical field known as animal studies, whilst also considering the broader cultural, philosophical and ethical implications  of how we think about the relationship between humans and animals.

      EN710 - Victorian Aestheticism and Decadence

      
      
       This module is an intensive study of aesthetic and decadent literature in late Victorian Britain. We will explore some of the key literary and critical works that popularised the concept of the 'aesthetic' and the ideal of the aesthetic life, and examine how and why 'art for art's sake' and 'decadence' came to be understood as the watchwords of a countercultural movement. The module also takes in along its way some of the manifestos, scandals, satires, and controversies that made aestheticism and decadence vivid in the public imagination, such as the 'Fleshly School of Poetry' controversy, the notorious periodical The Yellow Book, and the three trials of Oscar Wilde. This module pays particular attention to the relationship between the literary and visual arts, and aims to help students gain a sophisticated understanding of the intellectual and imaginative stakes of Victorian aestheticism and decadence, as well as of the social and material contexts from which a 'cult of beauty' arose in late Victorian Britain. We will consider the ways in which Aestheticism and Decadence look backward to Romanticism and forward to Modernism; how they became a means of imagining alternative sexualities, identities, and lifestyles; and how they clarify (or falsify) the relations between art, ethics, and politics.

       The module examines some key texts in the theory and literary presentation of utopia. In the first part of the module we will examine classic early utopian texts (Plato, More) and will set these in the context of the modern theory of historical progress (Hegel) the failure of that progress to materialise (Agamben) and the nature of hope for the future (Bloch). In the second part of the module, we will examine modern classics which look at the failure of the communist utopia (Zamyatin, Huxley, Orwell) and at later texts which revived the genre of utopia (LeGuin, Atwood).

       This module explores the representation and performance of sin, vice and misbehaviour in drama, c. 1350-1550.  Students will examine a range of medieval and early Tudor dramatic modes, and will consider how ideas about vice and sin were conveyed through performance, how such presentations worked in conjunction with their virtuous and divine counterparts, the audiences own embodied experience and the potential problems inherent in the bodily pleasures of performance.  Via the study of vice and sin, students will also encounter core aspects of medieval and early Tudor performance culture, dramaturgy, and the material, social and religious conditions that informed drama in this period.  In addition, students will be introduced to a range of non-dramatic primary sources, such as the Records of Early English Drama, medieval philosophy and theology, iconography, spiritual and devotional manuals, and etiquette books, which will sit alongside the playtexts and inform our understanding of medieval concepts of vice.  Modern theories of embodiment, cognition, space, phenomenology and performance will underpin the study of vice on this module and students will be asked to assess the usefulness of these models as a way of critically engaging with medieval and early Tudor drama.

      EN716 - Marxism, Literature and Culture

      
      
       This module offers students a synoptic perspective on Marxist cultural criticism from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day in Europe, Russia and North America. It begins with an analysis of a selection from Marxs own writings, with the aim of introducing key terms, such as alienation, ideology, and dialectic. Students understanding of these terms and their critical uses for literary and cultural studies will develop during the course of the module, as they encounter a range of important Marxist thinkers and their writings. Throughout the module students will be invited to interrogate and transgress the boundaries separating literary from critical texts, and theory from practice. They will be invited to consider creative practice and Marxist criticism in dialogue with one another at particular historical moments. Although anchored in the literary and the textual, the module will also offer opportunities to think critically about the term culture itself in its broadest senses, encompassing a range of aesthetic and social practices, such as sport and music. Progressing through the great class conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Frankfurt School, New Left and anti-racist decolonization movements of the postwar period, up to the contemporary neoliberal moment, the module aims finally to offer students a set of tools with which to understand their own cultural encounters in the present as well as to reconfigure and re-evaluate the cultural knowledge they have accumulated in stages one and two of their degree programmes.

      EN717 - The Graphic Novel

      
      
       This module focuses on the exploration of the graphic novel as a visual and literary medium. The module will interpret the term graphic novel broadly, and incorporate discussions of comic books, political cartoons, as well as film and television adaptations as a part of its curriculum. The module will begin with an examination of the more mature aesthetic that became increasingly popular for graphic novels during the late 1980s, and examine how these developments have continued to evolve to the present day. Strong emphasis will be placed on readings informed by sociological and political discourses. Students will be encouraged to relate their close analysis of texts to topics such as the distinctions between art and popular culture, and the connections between literary and social history, as well as contemporary concerns such as identity politics, neo-liberal capitalism, protest, and anarchy. As such, the module will demonstrate how the study of graphic novels directly relates to several key concerns in the study of undergraduate English.

       The Unknown asks you to think creatively and analytically and to learn by a combination of careful reading and experimental writing.  You will be able to use the skills of critical analysis and close reading developed elsewhere in your degree in new ways and to take a fresh look at the study of literature.  The course draws on the ideas writers have about writing, as well as on psychoanalysis, literary theory, fiction, poetry, drama and film.  It asks you to think deeply about how, and why, you read and write.

      EN655 - Places and Journeys

      
      
       This module explores what fascinates travellers and writers about both familiar and far-flung places. London, Istanbul, Cairo; roads, railways, and rivers; oceans, deserts, and deepest England: each place or mode of travel will be investigated as a source of inspiration, fantasy, and desire. How do invention and authenticity jostle for precedence in fictional as well as factual travel? Does travel writing reveal more about the places visited or the subjectivities of the writers? We will focus on modern writers with glances back to historical precursors. Writers studied should include Jack Kerouac, Orhan Pamuk, Iain Sinclair, Che Guevara, Paul Bowles, Gautam Malkani, Edward Said, Patrick Wright.

      EN656 - Heroes and Exiles: An Introduction to Old English Poetry

      
      
       In July 2009 a treasure-hunter unearthed the most significant hoard of Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever discovered in the British Isles: the Staffordshire Hoard.  The size and diversity of this treasure promises to reveal new insights into Anglo-Saxon life and culture.  But artefacts alone do not tell us everything; to get closer to the minds of those who made and used such items we need to recover the words of the Anglo-Saxons themselves, and this module, with its focus on the small but rich corpus of Old English Poetry, does exactly that.  This is a culture in which pagan and Christian ideals were melded together in ways quite unexpected to the modern mind.  We will discover a preoccupation with heroic deeds of warfare, and a desire to be remembered across the generations for feats of courage; we will also encounter a fear of being isolated from God, and the terrible sense of loss and longing of those who find themselves exiled from their lands and loved ones.  We will read a range of Old English poetry in modern English translations, setting it alongside manuscripts and images of artefacts to consider the ways in which the poetry both reflected and helped to shape Anglo-Saxon culture.  There will be the opportunity to engage at a very introductory level with the Old English language (no previous experience necessary), in order that we can explore the challenges of translating this complex and dazzling poetry into modern English.  The importance attached to the presentation element of assessment reflects the oral nature of Anglo-Saxon poetic culture.  Throughout the term you will receive help and advice on preparing for the presentation, and there will be opportunities to practise anad develop your presentations skills informally.

      EN657 - The Brontes in Context

      
      
       While the so-called Bront&euml; myth remains potent in popular culture today, the lives-and-works model associated with it continues to encourage readers to seek partially concealed Bront&euml; sisters in their fictions. Beginning and ending with the problematic of mythmaking  its origins in Gaskells 'Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;' and its subsequent perpetuation in film and other rewritings - this module will restore attention to the rich literary contribution made by the sisters through an intensive focus on their novels and selected poetry in the context of Victorian debates about gender and the woman question. Situating the Bront&euml;  myth in relation to other forms of mythmaking in the period (for example, ideologies of class, gender and empire), it will consider a small selection of film adaptations and go on to examine the Bront&euml;ss experiments with narrative voice and form, their variations upon the novel of education, the tensions between romance and realism in their writing and their engagement with religious and philosophical questions as well with the political, economic and social conditions of women in mid-Victorian culture. We will also consider a range of modern creative and critical engagements with the Bront&euml;s' literary works..

       This module explores the history and practice of crime fiction in the United States, from the detective stories of Edgar Allen Poe in the 1840s through the evolution of hardboiled narratives in the early and mid-twentieth century, and on into the 21st century novel. Attention is also paid to developments in film and television which parallel those in fiction, such as the birth of film noir and the contemporary cop series. During the course of the term, our readings of crime fiction will be supported by critical and theoretical texts by Franco Moretti, Tzvetan Todorov and others. Topics we will address include the relationship between high and low culture, how and why genres evolve, and the ways in which crime fiction addresses questions of race and gender

       Who wrote about their lives while Shakespeare was writing his plays and Queen Elizabeth was on the throne? Why did they do it, how and by whom did they intend their writing to be read, and what sort of things did they think were interesting about their lives? This module introduces you to the variety of sources available for exploring early modern life writing. Studying better- against less well-known texts (e.g. Anne Cliffords Diary and Shakespeares plays; early modern wills, letters and recipe books), and literary works alongside more pragmatic writings, the module will offer you an opportunity to investigate the private thoughts of the men and women of this crucial period of English history. Writing Lives is for anyone who has ever thought, even briefly, about keeping a diary  it encourages you to consider big questions like the nature of writing; the status of individuality; the forms which identity might take; but also stranger questions such as how the way you wrote a letter might have related to Hamlets To be or not to be speech.

       This module takes the figure of the stranger as a starting point for exploring the different ideas and contexts of belonging that have shaped the novel over the last century.  Contexts will include modernity and the Holocaust, race and gender in modern America, and contemporary fictions of exile and encounter.  Among the writers considered will be Joseph Conrad, Toni Morrison, and J M Coetzee.  The course will also draw on a variety of twentieth-century cultural, social and psychological conceptions of belonging, from the work of Sigmund Freud through to the more recent ideas of Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and Zygmunt Bauman.

       This module will trace the development of Chaucers literary reputation from his own attempts to forge an authorial legacy to his posthumous instantiation as The Father of English Poetry.  Some of the works of a generation of fifteenth-century followers who addressed Chaucer as a pioneer in vernacular poetry will be read alongside their adaptations of Chaucerian texts and literary techniques. The module will also explore the Chaucerian apocrypha, and assess what these additions to Chaucers literary corpus tell us about the authors fifteenth-century reception. The module will go on to follow some of the history of Chaucer in print, before assessing more modern appropriations of Chaucer in cinema, television and online media.

       This module will bring together works of poetry and fiction by a number of black writers in the USA and Canada in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With a particular emphasis on migration, music, and urban space, we will explore the intellectual, political, and aesthetic imperatives that drive these writers to address questions of race, ethnicity, gender, belonging, representation, poverty, privilege, and trauma. Beginning in Harlem in the 1920s, the moment when the Negro was in vogue, students will examine the ways in which black Americans and Canadians have sought to make their impact on the literary landscape, by turns exposing and employing the power structures of the dominant culture. This comparative look at US and Canadian literatures, however, also challenges students to scrutinize the construction of literary and other categories, and to consider the commonality and distinctive difference between black experience north and south of the 49th parallel. Lectures/workshops will emphasise discussion of key moments and movements in African American / African Canadian arts; the significance of linguistic distinctiveness; the cultural self-categorisation of black, African American, Africadian and Halfrican identities; and the rise of African American literary theory.

       This module introduces students to the drama of Shakespeare's time, thinking in particular about the new theatrical buildings and the discoveries they made possible. The module encourages independent study and is consequently built around student interests as they develop their own research questions and essay topic.This period saw the emergence of the first permanent purpose built playhouses, and the development of the theatre industry.  We will consider how the conditions of performance and production  such as playhouse architecture, the reportorial system, printing, censorship and Londons changing urban environment  affected playwrights, actors and audiences. Reading a range of playwrights, students will get a sense of the main trends which shaped the drama of the time, contextualising their understanding of canonical writers such as Shakespeare. Students will also engage with the current developments in early modern theatre history and the ways in which thinking about authorship, staging, printing and other key concepts from the period has altered over the last fifty years. As part of this work, we will examine the phenomena of modern reconstructed playhouses such as Shakespeares Globe, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse and the American Shakespeare Centres Blackfriars, asking what - if anything - modern performance in these spaces can tell us about early modern practices.Office hours will support students in their independent work towards a long essay, whilst weekly two hour seminars will emphasise key moments in the period which will inform the individual interests of all students. Alongside the weekly seminar, the third hour of teaching will be used for workshops, screenings, directed reading/research group meetings and field tips.

       Unruly Women & Other Insubordinates:   The Dramatic Repertoire of the Queen Anna's Men (1604-1625) The Jacobean period is renowned for producing some of the most incisive, inventive, and interrogative drama in the English language --  plays which both delve into the darker corners of human experience (lust, temptation, sin, revenge) and affirm positive values for humanity (love, compassion, tolerance).  In this challenging module we will study a selection of plays in the context of the dramatic company that performed them,  Queen Annas Men.  In so doing we will engage with immediate contexts of dramatic production in the period: the organisation, work, and role of the dramatic company; the impact of playhouses and their audiences; the often collaborative nature of playwriting (particularly the work of Thomas Heywood, but also that of  John Day, Thomas Dekker, William Rowley and  John Webster).  We will also pay attention to the literary qualities of these plays, especially their complexities of genre (comedy, tragedy, tragi-comedy) and subtleties of language.  Combining literary analysis with an attention to the specific work of one dramatic company, this module offers an innovative approach to Jacobean drama that enables reach fresh readings of both familiar and neglected plays in the period.

      EN646 - Image, Vision and Dream: Medieval Texts and  Visual Culture

      
      
       This module explores the complex relationships between written and visual culture, the latter including both artefacts such as paintings and sculpture, and the products of visual imagination such as dreams and visions.  We will ask questions such as: Can images really be innocent representations, or are they always replete with social, political and ideological significations?  In what ways might we 'read' images in order to recover those significations?  Where text and images appear together, is the relationship between them hierarchical, or are other kinds of relationship possible?  How might we blur the boundaries between text and image, for example in the case of narrative images, or descriptive and imagistic texts?  The rich textual and visual culture of the Middle Ages is used as a starting point, a lens through which you will have the opportunity to explore these questions from a range of angles, including the semiotic theories developed by Barthes as well as more traditional art-historical approaches.  We will explore texts from a variety of genres, including dream poetry and religious vision, alongside images in manuscripts, wall paintings, stained glass and sculpture.  The project element of the assessment offers you the opportunity to undertake independent research on any aspect of the module you choose (whether medieval or not); topics chosen in recent years have ranged from an exploration of meaning in medieval maps to a study of the iconography employed by Lady Gaga in videos and other publicity materials.

       The module focuses on the literary production of North Americas indigenous peoples, drawing on the historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts of one tribe, the Anishinaabeg, or Ojibwe. Students will be encouraged to explore aesthetic and intellectual developments in Native literature and theory; to examine the nature of indigenous status in relation to both North America and the wider world; and to draw on their understanding of canonical literature and literary theory to isolate points of intersection and divergence between Native American and American literatures. We will cover a wide range of literary forms, from transcriptions of oral traditions, through autobiography, to the postmodern novel; and scrutinize and employ a number of strategies of reading the unfamiliar, from ethnological discourse to tribal literary nationalism.The relationship between Native American literature and art will be a key feature of lecture/workshop discussion and, where appropriate, film screenings will be offered.

       This module explores the eighteenth-century fascination with bodies and the truths (or lies) bodies were supposed to reveal. The course focuses on the ways in which the body is read and constructed in eighteenth-century literature and how these readings and constructions reflect various concerns about class, race, gender and sexuality. Through the course of this module we will examine a range of literary representations of the body which seek both to control the body and to celebrate its destructive potential. We will read texts from a variety of genres, including medical literature, misogynist satire, sentimental novels, popular fiction, travel writing and pornography alongside recent critical work by Thomas Lacqueur, Michel Foucault, Roy Porter, Stallybrass and White, which illuminate the ideological stakes writers played for when writing about the body. Topics for discussion will include disability and deformity, race, the sentimental body, dress and the body, the body as a text and the relationship between the body and the body politic. The primary focus of this option will be literature, but we will also examine visual representations of the body in caricature and satire as well as in the portraiture.

       This module focuses on the theory and practice of marriage and divorce in early modern England and its treatment in the literature of the period. Examining a wide range of texts (drama, poetry, prose works and domestic handbooks alongside documentary sources such as wills, legal records and letters), it will explore the ways in which representations of marriage and its breakdown both reflected and informed the roles of men and women in early modern society. The relationships between discourses about gender, politics and the historical evidence about men and women's married lives in the period will be explored both through reading in the extensive secondary literature of gender, women's history and masculinity as well as through the study of primary sources such as wills, court records, advice books, popular literature (ballads and pamphlets, for example), literary texts (poems, plays and tracts), diaries and personal memoirs and material objects such as wedding rings and scolds bridles, for example. From Shakespeare and Fletcher's dramas of happy and unhappy marriage and Spenser's poetry of marital bliss,  to argument surrounding men and women's roles in marriage in the poetry and pamphlets of Milton and his contemporaries, we will also go in search of the personal accounts of women and men's experiences of marriage and its breakdown and the material artefacts which are testament to them.

      EN670 - Lyric, Ballad and Popular Song

      
      
       This course looks at how British and American popular song has been collected and transformed by literary professionals (particularly poets and academics) from the eighteenth century to the present day. The focus of the module is on poetry that has its origins in vernacular traditions of ballad singing, but its purview takes in all sorts of writings that are apt to be sung, or that have the vocal/lyrical medium as a significant element of their textual identity. The course is structured as a historical survey, tracing succeeding attempts by collectors, academics, poets and singers to preserve and to adapt such songs. It progresses from eighteenth-century and romantic-period ballad collectors such as Thomas Percy and Walter Scott, through revivalists such as Francis James Child, Lady Gregory, Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp, to contemporary popular musicians who draw on oral sources, such as Bob Dylan and P.J. Harvey. Students will be encouraged to consider how the figure of the singer and the act of singing have been used by poets (Gray, McPherson, Wordsworth, Dickinson, Hardy, Yeats, Gurney, Auden, Bishop) in figurative representations both of the inherited component of literary culture, and of the sublime (or otherwise ineffable) component of their particular art, poetry. Through discussions of theoretical texts students will be encouraged to consider the contrasting functions of poetic language from the perspectives of speech, lyric, narrative and vocalized song. The broad aims of the course are to help students find a critical idiom through which to describe the textual interdependence of inscribed, vocalized and musical articulations; to trace historical changes in that relationship; and to understand the ideological contexts of those changes in succeeding ages of nation-building, of empire, of world war, and of globalization.

       This module will look at a variety of texts, in a variety of forms, from the early nineteenth century to the present.  The poems, essays, novels, films, paintings and autobiographies all engage with and question our relationship to the world around us.  They sometimes look at nature, but more often ask what it is, what do we use it for, what is our relationship to it, what does it mean for us, what do we make it mean and to what ends, or what is the role that language plays in creating or representing our role in the world? Moreover, while nature may be seen to be something out there the module seeks to ask how it is connected to our understanding of identity, history, or sexuality.The module is not arranged around primary creative texts, and their theoretical accompaniments, but has a more ecological approach to the idea of the creative/critical boundary which means that some weeks core texts may be theoretical ones (such as John Grays Straw Dogs).  This approach is reflected in the modes of assessment where students are invited to produce either two essays, or one traditionally critical one, and one work of creative non-fiction that may encompass aspects of memoir, poetry, psychogeography or philosophy.

       Poetry and Crisis will tell a history of twentieth-century poetry through the lens of the major political events that have shaped it. Addressing key social issues including economic crisis, class, nation, war and postcolonialism, the module will investigate both key figures in the history of mainstream poetic tradition (W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Derek Walcott) and more experimental and collaborative movements such as proletarian realism, Language Poetry and art associated with the Occupy movement. Within these traditions, students will explore the possible ways in which poetry can be said to articulate, respond to and intervene in political crisis.

      EN676 - Cross-Cultural Coming-of-Age Narratives

      
      
       If the Bildungsroman has been criticised for being outmoded and conservative, how do contemporary writers interrogate and expand its scope and importance? Are coming-of-age narratives merely private stories or can they be read in ways which highlight their social functions, and what kind of theoretical, aesthetic and cultural perspectives can we apply to scrutinise these functions? This module will bring together a range of texts and films from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that can be read within and against the literary tradition of the Bildungsroman or the coming-of-age narrative. Drawing on material from the US, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe, we will spend time analysing the representation of the coming-of-age experience in terms of content and form and assess the ideological functions of the Bildungsroman in a cross-cultural context. Particular attention will be given to questions of racial and ethnic identity, migration, colonialism, memory, trauma, belonging and sexuality. We will also explore the connection of the Bildungsroman with genres such as autobiography, memoir, young adult fiction, travel narrative, graphic novel, and film.

      LW592 - Public Law 2

      
      
       The module builds on the understanding of constitutional government developed in Public Law 1 to examine the changing nature of the state in new modes of governance and governmentality.  The focus is on the shift away from the vertical character of the relationship between state and citizen to a more diffuse mode of governing populations through expertise, techniques of management, and biopolitics. In recent times there has been a shift away from states governing through legislation as a mode of command and control. Legislation is increasingly understood as enabling administration and governance rather than as the definitive word on a social or political problem.  In some respects, this is a continuation of legislation as a mode of authorising the exercise of public power.  However, the nature of power deployed and regulated through legislation has changed.  Government through officials or agents directly responsible to Ministers or Parliament is increasingly replaced by quasi-government authorities  (QUANGOS) whose strength is technical expertise. While the administrative state as it has evolved in the last century views this shift as a new strength in public administration, the key weakness is that accountability in the exercise of public power is lacking.  What are the implications of these transformations for public law?  How has public law facilitated these developments? What are the socio-legal and critical legal responses to these developments? These are the central concerns of this module.  It thus offers a specialised and complementary extension of themes and issues introduced to students in Public Law 1 in Stage 1 of the LLB degree.  The administrative authorities that have emerged in the era of the new administrative law  post 1970s - lack the formality of liberal constitutional protections.  Consider the relative informality in the administration of ASBOS. Moreover, the traditional public/private divide has broken down -  e.g. the privatisation of prisons, private corporations providing public services such as nursing homes or transport. The absence of social consensus, or unitary sovereign power has meant that the governance of gambling, security, the environment, gender and sexuality, science and technology, are not phenomena that can be dealt with through traditional liberal concepts or constitutional mechanisms.  This module will examine how public law has been the site of social, political, and legal contestations regarding these issues.
