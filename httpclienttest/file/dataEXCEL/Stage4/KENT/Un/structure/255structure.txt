Course structure


Students can choose two different routes onto the Minor in Quantitative Research:

 Firstly, students can choose the Minor from the start of their studies, taking the module &lsquo;An introduction to Quantitative Social Research&rsquo; in Stage 1.  
 Alternatively, students taking single honours Criminology can move onto the  Sociology with Quantitative Research  programme at the end of Stage 1, taking a shorter, non-contributory five-credit module &lsquo;A short introduction to Quantitative Social Research&rsquo; within the new Kent Q-Step Centre summer school (being launched summer 2016). This non-contributory module is a Pre-Sessional Course for Stage 2.


From Stage 2, these two pathways are identical, and are therefore included in the same programme specification here.

At each stage of your studies, you take a balance of compulsory and optional modules from sociology and quantitative research, providing  you with subject-specific  knowledge while  enhancing your quantitative research skills.  

In addition, you will undertake several placements and will carry out at least one quantitative research project for an external organisation during your degree. See 
www.kent.ac.uk/qstep
 for details.

The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.  

Stage 1

You build a strong foundation in and improve your quantitative skills and advance your statistical knowledge, while developing a strong background in sociology. You develop your skills in using quantitative data to support your critical thinking.

Stage 2

You continue to study sociology as well as take an advanced module in causal thinking in quantitative research, and improve your skills in communicating quantitative analyses to a range of audiences. You choose from a list of advanced quantitative options including Big Data analysis, spatial analysis, longitudinal analysis, and multilevel analysis, and are trained in non-quantitative research. You undertake a quantitative project as part of one of your modules.

Stage 3

As in Stage 2, you continue studying sociological topics and complete a dissertation based on your own quantitative research, and a placements module. You are also encouraged to take further advanced quantitative options (as outlined in Stage 2).




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SO336 - Sociology of Everyday Life

      
      
       Sociology offers insight into how society works. To do this, we question and look behind the common sense view of everything in the social world. This course looks at a range of important and topical aspects of society and explains how we can make better sense of them by thinking sociologically. The aim is to introduce students to the wide range of topics which comprise contemporary Sociology and indicate how social circumstances shape and influence our lives. Why do powerful differences and inequalities between men and women persist even though both are now formally equal? Why, in a world that is safer and healthier than ever before, do we witness so much concern about risks such as to our health, children and security. These are type of questions we will begin to answer. The course is suitable both for those who have studied sociology at A level, and those who have not. There is a considerable emphasis on interactive discussion, through weekly seminar groups.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO337 - Fundamentals of Sociology

      
      
       This course provides grounding in the basic history and assumptions of sociological thinking and research, and how they apply to key aspects of our society. Topics are less from everyday experience than in the Sociology of Everyday Life course, focusing on more abstract topics such as the state and globalization. Students will also be encouraged to consider competing perspectives on these topics and how they might be assessed. There will be a lecture and seminar each week and students will be encouraged to engage in informed discussion and debate. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO341 - Critical Thinking

      
      
       This module aims to develop key research and critical skills in students on their arrival at Kent, which they can build on in their further research and substantive modules in their degree.  Learning will be oriented around two applied tasks: i. A study of sociological, criminological and policy issues in different areas in Kent, with students undertaking one field trip to the area that are allocated to their group;ii. A study of stratification (class, gender, age, ethnicity, disability, sexuality etc) within the student body itself, potentially using data from the new Kent Self-Study (a large, longitudinal survey of Kent students) and new qualitative data.  These two tasks will each be oriented around a particular question (e.g. students imagined futures, patterns of teenage pregnancy in Kent).  Students will first be taught about the practical issues in collecting relevant data, after which they then collect the data, and then reflect upon both their findings and the data collection process itself.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SA300 - Social Problems and Social Policy I: Youth,The family and the State

      
      
       This module is designed both for students intending to specialise in social policy, and for other students who are interested in social problems and responses to them. We explore the ways in which phenomena come to be labelled as social problems, we focus upon the problem of youth and why certain youth behaviours are seen as problematic, who defines them as such and what is expected in terms of the balance between state and family responsibility.  Issues explored include: young peoples changing relationship to the family; teenage pregnancy; education, transitions to work, migration drug (mis)use, youth homelessness and anti-social behaviour.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO334 - Modern Culture

      
      
       This module introduces students to discussions and debates surrounding modern culture. It looks at why culture has always been such a contested sphere and has a decisive impact on society at large. Students will look at culture in the widest sense, ranging from the arts to the banalities of everyday life in our consumer society; at how culture has expressed and organised the way people think and live from the days of 'protestantism' to those of post-punk. Books, magazines, radio, TV, movies, cartoons, fashion, graffiti, the cult of celebrity, youth subcultures and pop music will be used to understand class, history, sexuality, colonialism, revolution, conflict and globalisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO305 - Introduction to Criminology

      
      
       Crime is a major social and political issue and the source of much academic and popular debate.  Key criminological issues will be examined during the course of the module within their wider sociological and social policy context.  There will be a particular focus on understanding the nature and extent of crime and victimisation, analysing public and media perceptions of crime, and exploring the relationship between key social divisions (age, gender and ethnicity) and patterns of offending and victimisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

  Year in industry

  
   Placements are an important part of your degree and allow you to apply your quantitative and transferable skills in the workplace.

Subject to achieving an average of 60% in Stage 1 and 2, you can  apply to take  the placements module,  The Practice of Social Research.
  This module runs for one full academic year and includes a 200-hour placement within an academic learning experience. We encourage you to undertake additional placements in the summer after Stage 2 or Stage 3, and to do a placement linked to your dissertation. It is also possible to undertake a full-time paid sandwich year placement.

Placements provide you with  invaluable career experience and insight into the professional world,  while the  practical  use of your skills in the workplace  builds your  confidence.  With these experiences we hope that you will be  well equipped to  move seamlessly into quantitative methods careers, in academia or beyond upon graduation.
