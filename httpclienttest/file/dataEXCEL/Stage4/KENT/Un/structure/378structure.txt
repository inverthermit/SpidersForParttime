Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.


 Foundation year

 
  This programme is for students who do not have the qualifications needed for direct entry to Stage 1 of our degree programmes. It covers electronics, computing, physics and mathematics.

If you successfully complete the foundation year, you can go on to take either the Computer Systems Engineering programmes mentioned above or Electronics and Communications Engineering.

      EL033 - Introduction to programming using MATLAB

      
      
       This module introduces MATLAB as a technical programming language. As programming skills are essential for modern scientific and engineering work, and MATLAB is becoming an important tool for technical computations, this module enables students to cover both these requirements simultaneously. It provides students with an effective understanding of programming concepts and techniques as well as the basic software engineering process required to develop solutions to given problems using the MATLAB environment. Reflecting the need to appreciate both the functionality of programming structures and the issues involved in programming implementations the course is organised in a series of alternating theoretical lectures and practical, problem driven, terminal sessions.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
