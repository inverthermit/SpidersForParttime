      EC313 - Microeconomics for Business

      
      
       This module is designed for students who have not studied Microeconomics for Business before or who have not previously completed a comprehensive introductory course in economics.

Module workshops apply economic analysis and techniques to business situations. The module is carefully designed to tell you what topics are covered under each major subject area, to give readings for these subjects, and to provide a list of different types of questions to test and extend your understanding of the material.

      GE312 - Images of Germany, 1945-1990

      
      
       German cultural production since 1945 had been largely dominated by ideologies and politics, by the forced forty-year division into two republics in opposite camps in the Cold War, and by the legacy of National Socialism, which factors all contributed to the eruption of student unrest in the 1960s. The material studied on the module covers the problems of returning soldiers in 1945 and the hardships endured by the civilian population; the trauma of the Holocaust; the pioneering idealism in the foundational phase in the German Democratic Republic and a satirical take on that; the pain caused to ordinary individuals by the erection of the Berlin Wall; the significance of the Vietnam War to the Left in the 1960s and the turn to violence in the pursuit of political goals in the following decade; and concludes with a collection of post-unification short stories with little political import.

      GE591 - German Expressionism 1910-1925

      
      
       This module explores one of the major contributions of Germanic culture to modernism. Straddling the period immediately before, during, and after the First World War, Expressionism emerged as a reaction against the mechanizing forces of modern industrial society, seeking nothing less than a renewal of mankind. With compelling intensity, the Expressionists developed an immediately recognizable style that found an audience across Europe. This module looks at works from a range of genres: from poetry to drama, from prose (both fiction and manifestos) to painting, Expressionism was a key strand of international modernism across the Arts, embracing figures as diverse as Georg Kaiser, Kurt Pinthus, Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, Franz Kafka, and Oskar Kokoschka. A century later, it remains one of the most important  and most idiosyncratically Germanic  of all modern artistic movements.

Decision Analysis (DA) provides a structured and coherent approach to decision making. It involves a wide range of quantitative and graphical methods for identifying, representing, and assessing alternatives in order to determine a best course of action. DA is regularly employed by many leading companies in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, utilities, automotive, and financial services sectors. In this module, you learn about the basic concepts of DA and how to apply it in a variety of practical business planning situations. An indicative list of topics is provided below. Introduction to decision making: understanding why decisions are hard, the art of making good decisions, the main building blocks of structured decision making. Decision trees: a walk through of the construction and use of decision trees for graphically representing and analysing risky decision problems. Expected value decision criterion: a short introduction to probability theory, how to compute expected values, and the use of an expected value decision criteria for solving decision trees. Alternative decision criteria: different types of risk attitude and a brief overview of alternative decision criteria for incorporating risk attitude. Overview of utility theory: a critical look at expected value and potential problems with using it, the concept of utility and the elicitation of a utility function, the exponential utility function for modelling risk neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking decision makers. Dominance and sensitivity analysis: deterministic and stochastic dominance, tornado diagrams, one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis of probability estimates. Value of information: information and decision making, value of perfect information, value of sample information. Multi-criteria decision making: the analytical hierarchy process, comparing attributes, scoring alternatives, ranking alternatives, checking for consistency.

      CB523 - International Business

      
      
       The internationalisation of commerce and the worlds capital markets has spurred a growing interest in impact and success of foreign business entities in the home country. Many business decisions are influenced by global events and constrained by international institutions, and naive thinking about international politics, economics, cultures, exchange rates and foreign competitors can quickly have an adverse effect on a firm.The module aims to provide an understanding of the complex environment in which international business takes place and the ways companies deal with these challenges. The module is taught in two parts. The first part examines the political, economic and cultural environments that affect business. It also explores the determinants of national competitive advantage, the role of government and trade regulations in conducting business, the impact of regional integration and of international organisations such as the IMF and the WTO, the motives and the impact of multinational enterprises. The second part is dedicated to analysing the ways in which international business performs main functions such as human resource management, marketing and finance in an international context. Furthermore, international negotiations issues, corporate social responsibility and the relevance of e-business to international business are discussed. Case studies are used throughout the module in order to link theory and practice.

      CB658 - Diversity in Organisations

      
      
       This module presents an overview of what workforce diversity is and its relevance and usefulness in improving our understanding and management of people (including ourselves) at work. The demographics of the population and the workplace are changing drastically because of a number of factors, such as an increasing number of ethnic minorities and women in the workforce and in management. Accordingly, there is a need to effectively understand and manage workforce diversity not only to increase organisational business outcomes but also to create an inclusive workplace in a socially responsible manner. The module will examine issues confronting managers of a diverse workforce. In particular issues such as ethnicity, race, language, ageing, disability, gender, and intersectional identities will be discussed. Two key approaches towards managing diversity will be explained, i.e. the social equity case of managing diversity, and the business benefits case of managing diversity. The module will explore a range of diversity related concepts and topics, such as social identity, stereotyping, discrimination, intergroup conflict, structural integration, and organisational change. Main themes covered by this module will include:Origins of diversity and equal opportunity in the workplace context;Social and psychological perspectives on workplace diversity;The UK and European diversity contexts;Business benefits case and social equity case of managing diversity; The legal framework for diversity;Organisational approaches to diversity;Contemporary issues central to the experiences of diverse individuals in the UK and in organisations across a range of diversity dimensions;Diversity management in an international context

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      GE592 - German Expressionism 1910 - 1925

      
      
       This module explores one of the major contributions of Germanic culture to modernism. Straddling the period immediately before, during, and after the First World War, Expressionism emerged as a reaction against the mechanizing forces of modern industrial society, seeking nothing less than a renewal of mankind. With compelling intensity, the Expressionists developed an immediately recognizable style that found an audience across Europe. This module looks at works from a range of genres: from poetry to drama, from prose (both fiction and manifestos) to painting, Expressionism was a key strand of international modernism across the Arts, embracing figures as diverse as Georg Kaiser, Kurt Pinthus, Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, Franz Kafka, and Oskar Kokoschka. A century later, it remains one of the most important  and most idiosyncratically Germanic  of all modern artistic movements.

      GE590 - Wien-Berlin. Tales of Two Cities

      
      
       This module focuses on the recent history of Vienna and Berlin, the cultural capitals of the German-speaking world. Many of the key events and movements that influenced Europe over the past century are intimately linked to these two cities, from the collapse of the Habsburg Empire, the development of extremist left- and right-wing parties in the interwar period to the division and re-uniting of Europe as embodied by the Berlin Wall. Changes and continuities in the political, social and physical topography of Vienna and Berlin will be traced by studying representations of both cities in a range of texts and films from the early twentieth to the early twenty-first century. Alongside feature films and prose genres such as short stories and reportage, the module will also consider theoretical texts on the city and the contribution of urban life to modern German-language culture. Central themes are the interplay of individual and collective, urban anonymity and liberation versus alienation and uniformity, multiculturalism and migration.

       This module will examine the media systems of the contemporary German-speaking world, including both public and private structures and spanning print, broadcasting and digital media. In particular, it will trace the medias contribution to the creation and development of the public sphere in German-speaking countries, and the relationship between the media and its producers. Attention will also be paid throughout to the European and global dimension of todays media politics and culture. In the first half of the module, students will be given a systematic overview of the German-language media and media concentration (interdependence between media and market, public and private). Theories of journalism and public communication will be introduced and critically evaluated within the context of the rapid changes and shifts in structure which currently characterise the media landscape in German-speaking countries. In the second half of the module, students will be instructed in media analysis and the practical skills of drafting press releases, reviews and news articles in German. Topics that are currently in the news in German-speaking countries will be chosen in consultation with the seminar leader and followed across the various media in which they are reported (Pressespiegel). Students will apply the theoretical knowledge gained from the initial phase of the module to assess these samples in a critical essay. They will also produce a portfolio of shorter texts and/or recordings on current affairs and cultural topics. They will be encouraged as part of this portfolio to become active in on-line news forums in German. Depending on availability and resources, the second half of the module will include a workshop session with German-language media professionals. Contacts will be forged that will lead to the possibility of work experience in the media in German-speaking countries for students who have completed the module.The module will be taught and assessed entirely in German.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.
