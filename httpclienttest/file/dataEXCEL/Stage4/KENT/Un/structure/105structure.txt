Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PL302 - Introduction to Philosophy: Knowledge and Metaphysics

      
      
       Can I know that I am not dreaming? Am I the same person I was when I was ten years old? Do I have an immaterial mind or immortal soul? Am I a mere machine or do I have a free will? What are the fundamental properties of the world? Does God exist? This module is meant to be an introduction to these and other fundamental problems of philosophy. The module begins with an examination of some themes in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, and moves on to discuss the arguments of other classical philosophers, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and also of contemporary thinkers. Among the themes addressed are: the nature of knowledge, scepticism, personal identity, the mind-body problem, free will and determinism, primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, God. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL303 - Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics

      
      
       Students studying on this module will be introduced to a number of big questions in ethics. The questions may include the following: What makes a life good? Is it happiness? Or is it something else? Another big question is: What makes actions right or wrong? Is it God demanding or forbidding them? Or are actions perhaps right to the extent that they serve to make lives better off, and wrong to the extent that they make lives worse off? Some philosophers have thought so. Others wonder: What if I steal money from someone so rich that my act in no way makes her life go any worse. Might it still be the case that I have acted wronglyeven if I haven't made anyone worse off? A third bit question is this: Whats the status of morality? Is it, for example, the case that whats right for me might be wrong for you? Does it make any sense at all to talk about moral claims being true or false, even relative to moral communities? Might moral judgments be nothing but expressions of sentiments? Throughout the course, students will be examining these and similar questions from the point of view of a variety of philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL310 - Introduction to Philosopy: Logic and Reasoning

      
      
       Since Platos Dialogues, it has been part of philosophical enquiry to consider philosophical questions using logic and common sense alone.  This module aims to train students to continue in that tradition.  In the first part students will be introduced to basic themes in introductory logic and critical thinking.  In the second part students will be presented with a problem each week in the form of a short argument, question, or philosophical puzzle and will be asked to think about it without consulting the literature.  The problem, and students responses to it, will then form the basis of a structured discussion.  By the end of the module, students (a) will have acquired a basic logical vocabulary and techniques for the evaluation of arguments; (b) will have practised applying these techniques to selected philosophical topics; and (c) will have acquired the ability to look at new claims or problems and to apply their newly acquired argumentative and critical skills in order to generate philosophical discussions of them.It will be taught through a combination of lectures and seminars in the first half of the term, and seminars only in the second half of the term.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL315 - Philosophical Reading and Writing (core)

      
      
       What do philosophers do?  How do they think?  What do they typically think about?  How do philosophers write?  What sorts of writing are acceptable in philosophy?  How should you write?  How should philosophy best be read in order to be understood and assessed? In this module we will introduce you to some of the most interesting questions in philosophy, both from its history and from current debates.  As we do this we will show you how to think, read and write as a philosopher.   Some of the questions we will discuss this year include: Why is Humes fork so important in the history of philosophy?, What is the difference between evaluative and descriptive judgements in aesthetics? and What is the difference between is and ought?  We will also think about questions of more general philosophical import, such as: What it is to presuppose something?, What is it to argue in a vicious circle?, and What does a philosophical definition look like?

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CP311 - The Tale

      
      
       This literary-critical module deals with a wide range of selected international tales ranging from antiquity to the present day. The module addresses issues such as the development of oral folktales and fairytales into written forms, and discusses various short prose genres including Aesopian fables, myths, folktales and fairytales, as well as tales of the fantastic, 19th century art-tales and the modern short story. The framework of discussion comprises a general survey of the issues that face the comparatist. In the course of the module students practice different methods of literary analysis, including close reading and comparative analysis by examining story-motifs and story-structures, and by considering symbolic meanings in the light of psychoanalytic concepts. Students also explore questions of transmission and transformation (e.g. how stories and motifs travel from one culture to another and alter in shape and emphasis) and questions of genre (for example the fantastic). A selection of critical texts on narrative devices and patterns, on psychoanalytical, structuralist and feminist approaches to the fairytale and on genre theories are studied in conjunction with the primary texts.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP510 - The Text: Approaches to Comparative Literature

      
      
       The module covers a variety of exercises from the close reading of poetic texts to the appraisal of a range of theoretical writings. Most material is drawn from European writing of the past two centuries, though the Bible and some medieval and Renaissance texts are also studied. Topics include: the holy text; the literary text; genre; poetic form; the fantastic; the avant-garde; postmodernism; text and image; psychoanalytic readings; and deconstruction.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP524 - Fiction and Power

      
      
       This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran.  Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish).This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP534 - Modern Arabic Literature and the Middle East

      
      
       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.  

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP646 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP658 - Nordic Literature and Film

      
      
       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP652 - Postcolonial Images of Africa and South Asia

      
      
       This is a module about the intersection of colonial power relations, anti-colonialism, postcolonialism, feminism, and identity politics in literature from 1940 to 2010 which interrogates the influence of imperialism on a sense of self. It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

      PL628 - Continental Philosophy: Subject, Identity and the Political

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to introduce students to some of the key arguments and debates in contemporary continental political philosophy through the focussed reading and discussion of the works of a number of central thinkers (Charles Taylor, Iris Marion Young, Foucualt, Derrida, Butler) in this field. It is also the aim of this module to consider the works and ideas of philosophers that are often overlooked on undergraduate political philosophy courses e.g. feminist thinkers and Queer theorists.The curriculum should not be regarded as written in stone but responsive to new publications and developments in this field of research and to events in the wider world.

      PL638 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations.   They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology.  Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel.  However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes.  In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist.  An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students.  However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand.  This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight.    The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers.  Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full.  These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

      PL640 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL642 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL625 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      PL618 - Political Philosophy

      
      
       Is it right that the talented profit from their (undeserved) talents? Should the government provide compensation for people who find it hard to meet that special someone? Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

      PL620 - Justice, Violence and the State

      
      
       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses.

      PL584 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL585 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL596 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL602 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval.The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

       What is art?  What is an artwork?  Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common?  If so, what are they?  Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided?  Do avant-garde works count as art?  Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention?  What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally?  These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course.  After that we will consider other issues and questions.  What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities?  What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way?  Why is rock music such a part of our lives?  Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery?  What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art?  Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters?  Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code?  And what on earth is the point of public art?  What is public art?

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP652 - Postcolonial Images of Africa and South Asia

      
      
       This is a module about the intersection of colonial power relations, anti-colonialism, postcolonialism, feminism, and identity politics in literature from 1940 to 2010 which interrogates the influence of imperialism on a sense of self. It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP653 - Comparative Literature and English & Linguistics in the Classroom

      
      
       This module will provide the opportunity for third year undergraduates to gain valuable transferable skills by giving them some first-hand teaching experience in a secondary school classroom. Each student will spend half a day each week for one term in a local school under the supervision of a specific teacher, who will act as a mentor, and decide the tasks and responsibilities of the student. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other.They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progressed, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school.

      CP658 - Nordic Literature and Film

      
      
       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

      CP502 - Fiction and Power

      
      
        This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran. Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish).

      CP647 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP650 - Decadence in Fin-de-Siecle Europe

      
      
       The module explores the development of decadence in late nineteenth-century Europe as an artistic response, a philosophic expression and a social critique. Taking the work of Charles Baudelaire and the failed revolutions of 1848 as its starting-points, the module examines decadence as both a symptom of political and artistic frustration and as a psychological investigation of what Max Weber would later term the disenchantment of the world. Key themes will include the role of the artist, nature versus artifice, fantasy and desire, sexuality, social morality versus personal freedom, and death. The module will not only explore decadence in terms of different literary genres (fiction, drama, poetry) but also in the visual arts of the period.

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory.

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

      CP641 - SWIPE Undergraduate Conference

      
      
       The SWIPE (Student Work-in-Progress Exposition) undergraduate conference module is designed particularly for undergraduate students working on their final-year dissertations or other extended coursework, but is open to all third year students. The conference will provide students with an opportunity to conduct independent research. In addition, it will give them a chance to discuss their and their fellow students work and to test some of their ideas in a larger context. The conference aims to foster the ongoing academic dialogue within Comparative Literature, the disciplines joined in LLB and the School of European Culture and Languages as a whole as well as with the larger scholarly community of the University of Kent at Canterbury and its other campuses. By giving students an opportunity of being introduced to, and partaking in, one of the prevalent forms of professional academic dialogue, the SWIPE conference is designed as a preparation for students further participation in exciting academic debates and to invite them to consider the challenges and opportunities of postgraduate studies. At the same time, it will serve to hone transferable skills useful in students professional careers in other sectors of public life (organisation, presentation, communication and the demonstration of self-confidence). To ensure a certain thematic coherence and provide students with some orientation while still leaving them a wide-ranging spectrum of thematic concerns from which to choose their subjects, a specific, but not limiting, conference title will be chosen every year (to be advertised in the current stage 2 and 3 handbooks). Titles like Violence, Love, Death, Silence or Resistance are envisaged. Students participation will not be limited to the six workshops and the presentation of their paper but will also include the complete organisation of the conference; with respect to the latter, the module convenors role is restricted to giving guidance, advice and, whenever necessary, help. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

      CP611 - Postmodernism

      
      
       The module will begin by studying some of the major early postmodern writers such as Charles Olson and Alain Robbe-Grillet. This will be followed by a comparative analysis of second-generation postmodern literature in both Europe and the United States, including writers such as Italo Calvino and Thomas Pynchon. The module will also reference postmodern texts in other media such as film (the Free Cinema movement) and the visual arts (most notably, Pop Art). Almost from its inception, postmodernism has been subject to theorization and to a highly charged debate over its status as either a radical and liberating movement or as a mere symptom of late capitalism and a media-saturated culture in which the medium is the message. Students will study some of the key theoretical documents on the postmodern, including extracts from the work of Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard.

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

      CP534 - Modern Arabic Literature and the Middle East

      
      
       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.

      CP518 - The Book and the Film: Adaptation and Interpretation

      
      
       This module seeks to explore how novels and plays are adapted and interpreted for the screen. We shall be looking at how certain texts lend themselves to multiple reshaping such as Laclos 'Dangerous Liasions' and Henry James 'The Turn of the Screw', both of which have been adapted for the screen more than once. We shall also analyse lesser known works that have gone on to become feature films, such as Arthur Schnitzlers short work Dream Story, filmed as 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Adaptations directed by widely recognised filmmakers such as De Sica,  Max Ophuls, Kubrick and Pier Paolo Pasolini will also be examined with a view to eliciting and understanding their particular approach to, and filmic vision of, written texts.

      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

      TH619 - Religious Studies and Philosophy in the Classroom

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. This module is aimed at those students who would like to follow a career as Secondary School teachers, but is also suitable to those who would like to combine an academic course with work experience. Placements in a school environment will enhance the students employment opportunities as they will acquire a range of skills. It will also provide the students with the opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of Religious Education and Philosophy in the secondary school context. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other. The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school where each student will have a designated teacher-mentor who will guide their work in school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progress, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school.

      PL570 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL576 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses

Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

      PL623 - Advanced Topics in Reasoning

      
      
       The module will cover some of the major topics of the theory of reasoning, with a focus on presenting students with new and exciting research. The syllabus will vary from year to year. The approach will be philosophical and critical, and may involve the close reading of texts. Students will be expected to engage critically with the works being studied and to formulate and argue for their own views on the issues covered. As an indication of the kind of topics covered, the following are three potential syllabi, one of which might operate in any particular year:1. Probability and probabilistic reasoning. This syllabus will present the major interpretations of probability and their connection with the various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. Topics covered might include: the classical interpretation; the logical interpretation; the subjective interpretation; the frequency interpretation; the propensity interpretation; the objective Bayesian interpretation. The key text will be D.A.Gillies (2000): Philosophical theories of probability, Routledge.2. Causality and causal reasoning. This syllabus will present the major theories of causality, including difference-making theories (probabilistic theories, counterfactual theories, agency theories), mechanistic theories (process theories, complex systems theories) and pluralist theories. It will go on to consider methods of causal reasoning in the sciences and the implications of such methods for the metaphysics of causality. In the absence of a comprehensive text, this syllabus will appeal to papers, especially those in the Oxford Handbook of Causation (OUP 2009), and Causality in the Sciences (OUP 2011).3. Invalid arguments. This syllabus will look in detail at methods of assessing the cogency of deductively invalid arguments. In particular it will present the methods of inductive logic for assessing the plausibility of arguments. It will provide an introduction to probabilistic logics and their semantics, as well as to methods of inference in probabilistic logics, with a focus on elementary methods that can be readily acquired by students with little prior training in logic and no prior knowledge of probability theory. In the absence of a text at a suitable level, this syllabus will be accompanied by a set of detailed lecture notes.Convenor: Jon WilliamsonJon Williamson works on various topics connected with reasoning, inference and scientific method, including causal reasoning in the sciences, inductive reasoning, and the nature of probability. The aim of this module is to introduce students to cutting-edge research on topics such as these. Jon is editor of the gazette The Reasoner, co-director of the Centre for Reasoning, and author of books on reasoning such as Bayesian nets and causality (OUP 2005), In defence of objective Bayesianism (OUP 2010) and Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks (Springer 2011).

      PL624 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      PL643 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL641 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL639 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations. They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel. However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes. In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist. An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students. However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand. This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight. The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers. Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full. These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

       The curriculum is intended to introduce students to some of the key arguments and debates in contemporary continental political philosophy through the focussed reading and discussion of the works of a number of central thinkers (Charles Taylor, Iris Marion Young, Foucualt, Derrida, Butler) in this field. It is also the aim of this module to consider the works and ideas of philosophers that are often overlooked on undergraduate political philosophy courses e.g. feminist thinkers and Queer theorists.The curriculum should not be regarded as written in stone but responsive to new publications and developments in this field of research and to events in the wider world.

      PL514 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL526 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art? What is an artwork? Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common? If so, what are they? Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided? Do avant-garde works count as art? Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention? What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally? These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course. After that we will consider other issues and questions. What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities? What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way? Why is rock music such a part of our lives? Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery? What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art? Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters? Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code? And what on earth is the point of public art? What is public art?

      PL527 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.
