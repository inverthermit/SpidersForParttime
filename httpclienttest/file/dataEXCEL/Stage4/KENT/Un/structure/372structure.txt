      HI426 - Making History: Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module has two aims: 1) to contribute towards equipping the students with the necessary practical and intellectual skills for them to think and write as historians at an undergraduate level; 2) to encourage them to think reflectively and critically about the nature of the historical discipline, its epistemological claims, and why we, as historians, do what we do in the way we do it. This will be achieved through four blocks of seminars and lectures. These will cover: The practice of history, introducing history at university level at both a practical and conceptual level. Historical methodology. This will cover the development of university history in the nineteenth century and how this differed from the study and writing of history that had gone before. It will also consider the impact of the Social Sciences on the historical profession during the twentieth century. The varieties of history. This will examine some of the major themes and approaches, such as Marxism or nationalism, in modern historical scholarship. Beyond history. The final block will consider the linguistic turn and new ways of studying and writing history in the twenty-first century.A fifth component, concentrated in the first three or four weeks of the module, will provide training in core, practical skills (library and bibliographic skills, IT skills and the use of MyFolio and PDP).

      PO326 - Introduction to Political Science

      
      
        This core module introduces students to the wide range of different methodologies commonly employed in political science. This includes the scientific method and both traditional and newer forms of research. Students will also be introduced to some of the fields of inquiry that dominate the study of politics, including public choice, social movements, political behaviour, economic development and democracy. The module integrates these two main components to create both an awareness of the breadth of political science and its approaches, ultimately providing students with the foundation for further study in political science. Substantive topics include: the nature of inquiry (questioning and determining what constitutes evidence), methods of comparison, theory and hypotheses. They will also be introduced to and explore quantitative methods, formal methods, experimental methods and empirical quantitative methods. Students will implement basic quantitative research techniques for themselves. Finally, they will be introduced to concepts such as equivalence, selection bias, spuriousness, value bias and ecological and individualist fallacy in order to illuminate the difficulties faced when making comparisons. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO327 - Introduction to Comparative Politics

      
      
       The module introduces students to the empirical study of the key structures, institutions and processes in political life. It does so through the lens of the comparative method, in which political systems are compared and contrasted to test hypotheses about the factors producing similarities and differences across countries and over time. The module first introduces the comparative method, and then discusses the different ways in which political systems can be organized and classified. It focuses on the three key powers in all political systems  executive, legislative and judicial  the intermediate actors that link people to their governments, namely political parties, interest groups and the media, and how citizens behave politically in relations to such institutions and actors. Throughout the module, students are encouraged to identify the factors and the processes leading to different political outcomes across states and over time and to use both qualitative and quantitative data to support their arguments.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI431 - The Renaissance in the British Isles, 1400-1600

      
      
       English history is traditionally divided along dynastic lines and the divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period is usually dated to 1485. As Sellar and Yeatman observed The reign of Henry VII marks the end of the Middle Ages. Yet scholars of English literature, drama and culture have long been used to looking past political events and dynastic change to chart longer-term developments. This module introduces students to the years 1400-1600 as a cohesive period in English history that saw a transformation in political, literary, intellectual and religious culture. Moreover, in European terms the years from 1400 to 1600 witnessed the rise to cultural hegemony of the studia humanitatis, the discovery of the New World, and the religious upheavals of the European Reformation. This module looks at the major political events of these years  the Lancastrian Revolution, the Wars of the Roses, the Henrician Reformation, the Mid-Tudor Crisis, and the problems of female monarchy during the reign of Elizabeth I  in the context of longer term developments in the cultural, intellectual and social history of England. Students will be introduced to literary texts including both poetry and drama, material culture, and the built environment, alongside more traditional historical sources (such as chronicles, administrative records and correspondence) as sources for the historian of pre-modern England.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

       This module will provide a survey of the major events, themes and historiographical debates in early modern history from the Renaissance to religious wars of the early seventeenth century. This period in European history witnessed the cultural and social upheaval of the Reformation, the advent of print and the intellectual changes associated with Humanism, the formation of recognisably modern nation states, and the beginnings of Europes troubled engagement with the wider world. . As with the complementary module on later European history (c.1600-1750) the lectures and seminars will be arranged around six key areas:  1) religion 2) intellectual and scholarly life 3) economy 4) society 5) politics and war and 6) culture. These themes will be approached through the examination of national histories, specific events, and historiographical controversies. The topics covered will reflect the research and teaching interests of the School of Historys four permanent early modernists and prepare students for early modern modules taken at I and H level. Students will be encouraged to take this module along with a similar module in the Spring term which will cover the period from c.1600 to c.1750.

       This module will provide a survey of the major events, themes and historiographical debates in early modern history from the religious wars of the first half of the seventeenth century to the dawn of modernity in the second half of the eighteenth century. This period in European history witnessed the development of a system of nation states in Europe, the rise of Absolutism, the development of new European powers in Eastern and Central Europe, an expansion of European influence in the Americas and Asia (leading to a greater commercialisation of European society), as well as the fundamental shifts in European intellectual culture associated with the Scientific Revolution, overseas expansion and the Enlightenment. As with the complementary module on earlier European history (c.1450-1600) the lectures and seminars will be arranged around six key areas:  1) religion 2) intellectual and scholarly life 3) economy 4) society 5) politics and war and 6) culture. These themes will be approached through the examination of national histories, specific events, and historiographical controversies. The topics covered will reflect the research and teaching interests of the School of Historys early modernists and prepare students for early modern modules taken at I and H level. Students will be encouraged to take this module along with a similar module in the Autumn term which will cover the period from c.1450 to c.1600.

      HI397 - Cinema and Society, 1930 - 1960

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with an introduction to the ways in which historians use film as evidence.  It draws on a wide range of films, and stresses that they are to be understood in the context of the societies that produced them.  The films themselves reflect the ways in which the national cinemas of Britain, Europe and America portrayed the world around them.  The module will question the extent to which cinema, the most potent method of mass communication during this period, influenced hearts and minds by looking at films that were commercially successful and popular.  In this way, students will be introduced to the use of non-literary sources as historical documents, will be taught how to interpret them and become aware of the importance of contextualising evidence within a wider framework.Topics to be covered:Britain and the Great War: The Battle of the Somme; Soviet cinema: Battleship Potemkin; America in Depression: Grapes of Wrath; Britain at War: In Which We Serve; America at War: Bataan; Germany at War: Titanic; The McCarthy Era: On the Waterfront

      HI434 - Introduction to the History of Science

      
      
       Science has arguably been the greatest force for cultural change in the last 500 years.  Scientists have changed the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and have equipped us with technologies that enable us to fly in the sky and shoot neutrinos under the ground.  They have taught us that our observations can shift the nature of physics, yet that we are nothing more than jumped-up apes.  This module visits some of the most important events and developments since the so-called scientific revolution (c. 1700) in order to give a representative view of the history of science.  It also introduces key themes that have been pursued by historians science that collectively call into question some key assumptions about what science is really like.

      HI438 - Vikings: the European Project, 750-1066

      
      
       Vikings, in the popular imagination, are commonly perceived as horn-helmeted, blood-thirsty pirates who killed and pillaged their way across Europe in the Middle Ages with their blood-stained axes. In reality, Vikings did much more than that. They changed the existing early-medieval political order for good; they contributed a great deal to the international trade, economy and urbanisation of different parts of Europe; and they explored and settled the uncharted territories of the North Atlantic, specifically the Scottish Isles, Iceland, Greenland, and as far as 'Vinland' (parts of Newfoundland), becoming the first Europeans to reach and temporarily settle in the North American continent; and they were perhaps the most engaging story-tellers of their time. By the time the Norse settled down and ceased raiding in the second half of the eleventh century, they had fundamentally altered the political, religious, economic and military history of much of the known world. This course will attempt to separate fact from fiction by critically reading and analysing primary source documents alongside archaeological, linguistic and place-name evidence, and thereby uncover the real history that lies behind the well-known stories of the Viking World. In addition, the students will be introduced to the major historiographical debates related to the Viking Age.

The module will draw on a wide range of primary sources: Parliamentary debates, contemporary writings, including those of George Orwell and J B Priestley, cartoons, diaries, and personal memoirs. In order to increase familiarity with primary sources students will complete a compulsory document question as part of their Coursework. By the end of the module students should be able to discuss with authority the varying interpretations of the impact of the war. They will also have experienced the different approaches of political, social, cultural and economic historians, and this should provide a basis for choice of modules in Stage 2.

       This module aims to provide students with an historical analysis of the classic phase of British industrialisation, traditionally known as the Industrial Revolution.  Historians nowadays emphasise the gradual nature of industrial transformation in Britain, and the period considered here is sufficiently long to encompass several key issues in economic history: the transformation of the rural sector, the role of international trade in development, the origins and dynamics of industrial growth and innovation, the rise of a consumer society, the process of urbanisation, and the social costs of industrialisation.  The module will provide a grounding in historical concepts appropriate to the social sciences, and students will acquire a familiarity with historical statistics.

      PO661 - Fact, Evidence, Knowledge and Power

      
      
       This module is currently under revision as we are adjusting its contents to the changes we have made last year to our first year courses. Students will be emailed updated module information as soon as the review is completed. The revised PO661 module will build on and develop students knowledge of the approaches and methods used in the study of politics and international Relations introduced in the first year of the degree program and the foundation in the analysis of quantitative data established in the second year. We will consider the nature and purposes of descriptive and causal analysis in politics and international relations, thereby developing skills in choosing, using and evaluating the research designs and techniques for the collection and analyses of data used by researchers in these fields.  Emphasis in the course will be placed on a mixed methods approach to political analysis that enables student to integrate, analyse and evaluate both qualitative and quantitative information. In addition to developing a conceptual and theoretical understanding of different approaches to evidence gathering and analyses and how they can be combined, students will also have the opportunity to extent their skills in practical data analyses.

      PO657 - Political Research and Analysis

      
      
        The study of social and political phenomena is a vast endeavour and this class will serve as an introduction to methods for social science research. This 15 credit intermediate-level module is normally taken in Stage II. It provides a basic, non-technical introduction to the use of quantitative methods in the political sciences for students from a variety of educational backgrounds (including those with very limited knowledge of mathematical terminology and notation). The progression of this course will address scientific research design and methodology and consider many examples of such research In short, it seeks to enable students to read, interpret, and critically assess arguments drawing on quantitative methods in Politics and International Relations. Students with some prior exposure to quantitative methods will have the opportunity to improve their command of statistical software as well as apply their general statistical skills to data sets commonly found in policy and academic work.The module is divided into two main components: In the first part, students will be introduced to both the logic of empirical research in the social sciences and to basic concepts and techniques of descriptive uni-, bi-, and multi-variate data analysis. The second part will focus on uni-, bi-, and multi-variate inferential statistics. ICT skills will be acquired/enhanced of students by the introduction to and use of statistical software (SPSS). The focus will be on student-centred learning and critical reflection of selected examples of quantitative work in seminars and group work.

      PO658 - The Rise of China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of Chinas hegemonic role in pre-modern East Asia and its political development since the 1840s when it was forced to open up to the outside world and to lay a solid foundation for even more detailed study of present-day China. It deals with a recurrent theme in the study of Chinese politics, that is, how successive Chinese leaderships since the 1840s have reconciled Chinese indigenous political culture with models of modernisations that originated in the West. Focus is on how indigenous and foreign models for state-building and political development have guided Chinese thinking about national rejuvenation and modernisation. This module assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history or politics, and introduces students to the defining features of the Chinese traditional political system, including: Confucianism and Legalism, the causes of the demise of imperial China in 1911, the abortive attempts of republicanism and constitutionalism between 1912 and 1949, the rise of communism, and major political events since 1949 as well as its recent ascendancy. Questions to be explored in this module include: Why did the Chinese imperial system fail to meet the challenges and encroachment from the West and Japan? How did Chinese leaders understand modernisation? Why did Chinese political elites embrace communism? What have been the impacts of revolutions on Chinas external behaviour and relations, post-1949? How has Chinas worldview been socially constructed in its interactions with Western powers? What is Chinas grand strategy for development in the early 21st century?

      PO659 - Resistance, Suffering and Leadership

      
      
       This module will look at the political lives of three of the icons of contemporary world politics: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi. The module will begin with a brief introduction to biographical narrative as a method in political science. We will then discuss these three figures in three blocks of three weeks each, leaving one week for a concluding and comparative discussion (and one reading week). Throughout the module, the key themes of the title  resistance, suffering (sacrifice) and leadership  will serve as a focus as the module considers the lives of Gandhi, Mandela and Suu Kyi and their impact on world politics. Each block will first discuss the political life of the leader in question, after which one week will be devoted to some of his/her key primary writings, leaving one week to consider the meaning of resistance, suffering and leadership in each of the three lives.

      PO654 - Politics of Deeply Divided Societies

      
      
       This module explores the linkages between mediation theory and the practice of conflict resolution in deeply divided societies. Topics include the theory and practice of negotiations, conflict escalation and peace mediations while specific emphasis will be given to the role of regional or international institutions in early conflict prevention. The module applies negotiation theory in the study of state disintegration, demographic and environmental conflict, property rights, federal management and transitional justice. The course engages with the core literature in negotiation theory and exposes students to a number of simulations aiming to improve negotiation skills (identifying best alternatives, revealing or not preferences, identifying win-win arrangements, defeating spoilers and exercising veto rights). Because of the practical skills taught in the module and the interactive nature of in-class simulations, students are expected to attend lectures and tutorials.  Finally, the course examines the role of citizens and community organizations in peace mediations focusing on a number of selected case studies from deeply divided societies specifically Israel/Palestine, the former Yugoslavia, South Africa, Greece/Turkey (including Cyprus & the Kurdish issue), Rwanda and Northern Ireland.

      PO652 - Politics in the Classroom

      
      
       The module will begin with training sessions for the students in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of politics drawn from the national curriculum. These sessions will be run by the Partnership Development Office.After training the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a school in Spring term (this session includes time to travel to and from the School, preparation and debrief time with the teacher and in class time with the teacher and pupils  3 hours in total). They will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a topic or talk about aspects of university life. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of citizenship and politics within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project (final taught lesson) in consultation with the teacher and with the module convener. They must then implement and evaluate the project.

      PO638 - Political Behaviour in Britain

      
      
       The module examines the nature of political behaviour in Britain today.  It focuses on two key issues.  The first is the way that citizens participate in politics.  The module explores the nature of political participation, and how this has changed in the last few decades.  It also examines the characteristics of people who participate, and the factors that motivate individuals to engage in different forms of political participation.  The second key issue examined is voting behaviour.  The module considers how far electoral decisions are shaped by stable sociological factors, and how far voters today are less closely aligned with parties and more open to the influence of particular policy messages, personalities and media coverage.  Alongside this focus on the behaviour of citizens, the module also considers the activities of key intermediary organisations, such as legislators.  Throughout, the module seeks to develop students understanding and analytical skills, by considering theories and models of political behaviour along with the way data and other evidence can be brought to bear in testing the validity of these models.

      PO646 - Presidents, Parliaments and Democracy

      
      
       This module introduces students to central debates about the influence of different executive formats on democratic government. The course examines the differences between and within presidential, parliamentary and semi-presidential constitutions and examines their consequences for the quality of democracy and for policy outcomes. The course initially focuses on identifying the key institutions and processes that shape the behaviour and strategies of politicians in the executive, before moving on to consider the consequences of these for governance, policy-making and democratic stability. Throughout the central focus is on understanding the extent and the ways that formal political institutions may shape how politicians respond to citizen preferences, bargain with each other to resolve political conflict and choose policies. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about the impact of political institutions on politics, different ways of conceptualizing and measuring democratic performance and encouraged to think about how a broad range of other factors may interact with constitutional formats to shape outcomes. The approach used will be broadly comparative and will use case-specific and cross-national evidence from both developed and less developed democracies in all regions of the world.

       The course provides an overview of the broad field of international conflict analysis and resolution. Students have the opportunity to explore the motivations driving different forms of conflict, including interpersonal, group and civil violence. Students will also be exposed to a range of theories and approaches used to understand violent conflict, and a number of different methods of conflict resolution (e.g. negotiation, mediation, peacekeeping operations, and transitional justice.) The approach is interdisciplinary and juxtaposes traditional approaches used to study conflict management with new scientific studies of conflict and cooperation.

      PO666 - Religion and International Politics

      
      
       This module introduces students to the complex set of questions surrounding religion in international politics. The module begins by exploring contending political and sociological understandings of religion at the turn of the 20th century. It looks, in particular, at the constructed nature of the categories of the religious and the secular, and at the limits of the secularization thesis, which anticipated the privatization, decline and ultimately disappearance of religion in modernity. The discussion then turns to the relation between religion and secularism in Europe  with a focus on the question of European identity, multiculturalism, the relation between Europe and Islam and the numerous controversies surrounding Islam in Europe  and in the United States  with a focus on the concept of civil religion and the role of religious rhetoric and thinking in US foreign policy, particularly in the so-called war on terror. The module then explores the relation between religion and violence by looking at the role of the 16th and 17th wars of religion in the process of modern state formation and by asking whether there is a genuine connection between religion and violence. The concluding part of the module focuses on the emerging concept of the postsecular, its contending meanings, understandings and possible applications by focusing on the case of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

      PO667 - War and Peace in International Society

      
      
       The purpose of the module is to enable students to critically engage with the International Society (or English School) approach to International Relations. Combining political theory, IR theory, philosophy, sociology, and history this approach seeks to understand the theory and practice of international politics by reference to the historical development of relations between large scale political entities (from empires, hordes, kingdoms, to the modern nation-state and beyond) and the discourses that have emerged (Machiavellian, Grotian, Kantian) in response to the development of first European international society and eventually world society. The course focuses on the central features of international society - war and peace - as they have been conceived by the three traditions and members of the English School from Martin Wight to more contemporary figures.

      PO669 - Conservatism: Politics and International Relations of the Right

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to familiarise students with the conservative tradition in modern politics. This is achieved by reference to a range of key conservative thinkers selected by the module convenors to help students understand the diversity of the conservative tradition and consider what factors help to cohere it. Comparison within the tradition and across a variety of thinkers is achieved by examining these thinkers views on four basic categories of modern politics, namely the state, the market, society and international relations. In order to meet these broad learning outcomes, essay questions will be designed in order to ensure that students have to compare at least two thinkers. The module is structured around lectures and seminars. The module will be team-taught, allowing for a wider range of teaching and research expertise from both module convenors.

      PO563 - Foreign Policy Analysis and Management

      
      
       This module examines the complex relationship between foreign policy analysis and foreign policy practice.  It does so by exploring shifting approaches to making and examing foreign policy, including the contributions of  IR theory to Foreign Policy Analysis. Historical antecedents of foreign policy as a practice are examined via observations of traditional bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, followed by traditional state-based actors, non-state actors, and the nature of the structure they inhabit. FP decision-making is then examined, followed by the process of foreign policy implementation. The issue of motivation is tackled through analyses of the largely domestic impact of culture, interests and identity and broader effect of intra-state norms, ethics, the issue of human rights. Case studies of key countries reinforce the practical implications of above-mentioned issues throughout the module.

       Anglo-American countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, along with many Western European societies, have long prided themselves on their respect for liberal values. More recently, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and agitation for rights and civil freedoms in many Asian countries, liberalism has extended its reach as a source of political thought and action. Liberalism's values, practices and institutions are now admired, emulated, invoked and desired in many parts of the world. In this module, we look at liberalism as a philosophy of politics by studying the work of some of its major contemporary exponents and detractors. We examine the different approaches to liberalism advanced by figures such as John Rawls, Richard Rorty, and Will Kymlicka. To complement our understanding of liberalism, we consider the communitarian criticisms from thinkers like Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, the feminist criticism of liberalism by Susan Moller Okin, and the post-structuralist criticisms from Michel Foucault.

       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of China's political development in the 20th and early 21st centuries. After a brief overview of China's political history since 1949, it is designed around two core blocks of study.The first block looks at the principal political institutions that include the Communist Party, the government (the State Council), the legislature (the National People's Congress) and the military (the People's Liberation Army).The second block examines the socio-political issues and challenges facing the country in its ongoing development. They range from the prospects of democratisation and the growth of civil society, the issue of quality of life in the areas of the environment and public health, corruption, nationalism and ethnic minorities, national reunification, territorial disputes with neighbouring countries to China's engagement with global governance.A major theme of the module is to address why the Chinese communist regime is more durable and resilient than other non-democratic countries in achieving both economic growth and political stability and acquiring international influence, despite the fact that it faces numerous mounting development and governance  challenges.

       This module examines the rise and spread of popular religious movements in Western Europe from the eleventh to the early fourteenth century and considers how some of these movements became seen as heresy and were associated with political dissent, ideas of persecution and social and economic change. It also considers the leadership of the Medieval papacy and its contribution to the transformation and condemnation of religious and heretical movements. The module finally explores the reasons why popular religious movements provoked such strong reactions and compares and contrasts the treatment of these religious and heretical movements with that given to other social minorities (especially women, lepers and homosexuality).The course will draw on narrative, hagiographical, documentary and visual sources. The course will require students to engage with primary sources, and to think critically about theoretical approaches toward the above mentioned themes.

       This module covers the period approximately 1900-79 and follows the fortunes of H. G. Wells open conspiracy  his scheme by which scientists would rule the world.  The aim is to understand what scientists (and their friends and critics) thought was the social role of science during this period, and how they sought to make sure that science played that role.  We aim to find out why scientists thought a scientific approach to life and society was desirable; how they sought to impose it; and to what extent, or in what ways, they were successful in their aims.  Along the way we will see how scientists engaged with particular political ideologies, and with the government.  Examples covered include the poverty vs. ignorance nutrition debate during the great depression, the development of nuclear power and consumer technology at the Festival of Britain.  We will see the pivotal role played by WWII in terms of facilitating scientists ambitions to govern, and the rise of psychology as arguably the most influential science in terms of governance.  The module makes particular use of fictional and documentary film sources as a means to understand the place of science in public culture.

      HI566 - History Dissertation

      
      
       The purpose of the Stage Two History Dissertation is to provide students with the opportunity to explore a topic of their choice in depth, and at a more critical level than is usually possible within the constraints of a normal coursework essay. The essay must not be more than 10,000 words in length, excluding the bibliography. Students choose a topic in consultation with a member of the History School, who will provide supervision and advice on sources. A definitive title must be submitted to the supervisor by the end of the Autumn Term (Term 1) of the student's second year. The Dissertation will be written in the Spring Term (Term 2) and must be submitted by 12 noon on the first Monday of the Summer Term (Term 3). Unlike the dissertation in the Special Subject, the Stage Two History Dissertation may be based on the extended reading of secondary sources, although students will be encouraged to use primary sources wherever possible. Topics should not relate directly to the Special Subject which the student intends to take in their third year.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HI6002 - The British Army and Empire c1750-1920

      
      
       Between 1815 and 1914 Britain engaged in only one European war. The Empire was, therefore, the most consistent and most continuous influence in shaping the army as an institution and moulding public opinion of the army. This module will examine various aspects of the British armys imperial experience between 1750 and 1920 (although the focus will fall, for the most part on the small wars of the Victorian period). The central focus will be on the campaigning in Africa and India, exploring how a relatively small number of British soldiers managed to gain and retain control of such vast territories and populations. Through an examination of a wide range of literary and visual primary sources, the module will also explore how the imperial soldier specifically and imperial campaigning generally were presented to and reconfigured by a domestic audience.Topics covered will include:The everyday life of the imperial soldierRepresenting the imperial hero: Henry Havelock and Charles GordonThe portrayal of imperial campaigning in contemporary popular cultureThe legacy of the Boer War: commemoration, doctrine and reformThe modern memory of colonial warfare: from Lives of a Bengal Lancer to Zulu

      HI5023 - The American Civil War Era 1848-1877

      
      
       This course will examine this key era of US history by examining the key political and social events, developments in the history of ideas and historiographical controversies from the victory over Mexico to the final withdrawal of US troops from the South. It will focus on the changes that occurred and the changing interpretations of them. Students will be able to see the interplay of forces and ideas that led to a conflict that few, if any, wanted and lasted for longer than anyone expected. Historical and fictional depictions in art and film will be evaluated for the ways they shape perspectives. The key historical topics include the rise of slavery as a public issue in the late 1840s, the attempts to find compromise within the Constitutional framework, the activities of the extremists, the changing nature and goals of the war, the effects the war had on both sides, the plans for the post-war period, the changing elite and popular attitudes, the nature of the final, pragmatic arrangements that the country accepted. Students will be able to pursue topics of their choice alongside and as part of these themes.

      HI5031 - African History since 1800

      
      
       This module is meant to introduce students to the key processes and dynamics of sub-Saharan African history during the past two centuries. The course covers three chronological periods: the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. In their study of the pre-colonial period students, will especially familiarize themselves with the changing nature of African slavery and the nineteenth-century reconstruction of political authority in the face of economic, environmental and military challenges. The colonial period forms the second section of the course. Here, students will gain an understanding of the modalities of the colonial conquest, the creation and operation of colonial economies and the socio-cultural engineering brought about by European rule. The study of the colonial period will end with an analysis of African nationalisms and decolonisation. In the final part of the course, students will develop an understanding of the challenges faced by independent African nations. The nature of the post-colonial African state will be explored alongside such topical issues as the Rwandan Genocide and the African AIDS epidemic.

       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

       Seventeenth-century Britain experienced considerable division and tension, most obviously in the Civil Wars in mid-century between the countries which comprised the multiple kingdom of Britain.  The aim is to examine the reasons for, and the attempted resolution of, major political and religious problems, with a clear sense of the European context in which these events were played out.  Topics to be studied will include the ideological clashes between crown and parliament in England; the political and cultural divisions of `court' and `country'; religious disunity across the three kingdoms; the expansion of a `public sphere' of politics and religion; the failure of republican government in the 1650s; the instability of Restoration politics and the coming of the Glorious Revolution; and Britain's changing role in Europe across the century.

       This module explores the place of death within late medieval English culture, focusing especially on the visual evidence of tombs, architecture, and illuminated manuscripts. It will begin by examining how ideas about death and the dead were expressed in works of art before the arrival of the Black Death to England in 1348. We will then explore the ways in which funerary sculpture, architecture and painting changed after, and perhaps because of, the devastation of the plague. These sources will be set within the context of literary, documentary and liturgical evidence. Further, it will explore how historians approach the history of death from different disciplinary perspectives, and consider the place of visual evidence within a range of sources and methods.

       Condemned by the international community for refusing to sign the Kyoto Accords, rendered powerless by electricity blackouts, and stricken by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the United States of America is today embroiled in a narrative of environmental controversy and catastrophe.  This module explores to what extent the USA has been inviting doomsday throughout the modern (twentieth-century) period.  Commencing with an introductory session on writing and researching American environmental history, the module is then split into four sections: Science and Recreation, Doomsday Scenarios, Environmental Protest, and Consuming Nature.  Over the twelve weeks we will consider a range of environmental issues that include wildlife management in national parks, pesticide spraying on prairie farms, nuclear testing in Nevada, and Mickey Mouse rides in Disneyland.  By the end of the module, we will have constructed a comprehensive map of the United States based around themes of ecological transformation, assimilation and decay.

       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

       Fundamental to Western European political and cultural ambitions since the mid-eighteenth century has been technological change.  This module provides a unique and stimulating social history of science and technology in a period of industrialisation and imperial expansion.  In the first part, we examine the twin foundations of British industrial and imperial power exemplified by the dramatic eighteenth-century voyages of Captain James Cook around the Pacific, and by the evolution of the steam engine by James Watt in the same period.  In the second part of the module we focus on the powerful new nineteenth century technological systems - railways, steamships, electric telegraphs and ship canals - which served to discipline the diverse cultures of Empire, whether British, American or Continental.  In these ways, the module will provide a striking foundational study for an enriched understanding of politics and society in the modern world.

      HI6036 - Science Satirised

      
      
       By looking at how science and its practitioners have been represented in or made use of satire, we gain an important perspective on how science and society have interacted as the former came to dominance as an authoritative source of knowledge. Friends and enemies of science have used satire to gain sympathy or call its claims into question. Where science has provoked hope, fear, admiration or suspicion, where it has been deeply involved in political or military endeavour, where it has overstated its claims or fed visions of a better future, satire has cast popular and elite opinions into sharp relief. From Thomas Shadwells The Virtuoso and Gullivers Travels, Georgian and Victorian caricature, science fiction and Cold War film, to The Simpsons and the Infinite Monkey Cage, science and the men and women who have produced it have proved to be fertile sources for comedy and biting wit.

How it reacted to the crushing defeats of 1940 in France and 1942 in the Far East before transforming itself into a war-winning force. The course will begin with the inter-war army examining its lack of doctrine and the confused role it had in British and imperial defence plans. From there it will move on to examine the transformation of the army from a pre-war small professional outfit to a vast conscript army, before concluding on the situation in 1945, the retention of peacetime conscription and adaptation to the Cold War world. It will take a broad approach to military history, studying the political, economic and cultural realities behind the force.

       We seem, as it were, to have conquered andpeopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind.Sir John Seeley, The Expansion of England (1883)Despite Seeleys assertion of accidental conquest, at its zenith the British empire decidedly controlled over &frac14; of the worlds global real estate, and 1/5 of the worlds population. The economic, cultural and global impact of British colonialism is still very much apparent today - from contested borders and inter-state disputes, through languages and cultures, to the inequities in wealth and trade that exist between the prosperous North and the underdeveloped South. Why, then, was imperial expansion so vehemently defended by its protagonists in the 19th and 20th Centuries? And what made colonial conquest, colonisation, and economic exploitation of non-European spaces feasible on such a global scale and for so long? These are the big questions that underlie this module. Using documentary sources and specialist texts and articles, we shall investigate various aspects of British colonial rule from the perspective of its practitioners and from that of their colonial subjects. The intention is to try and understand European imperialism on its own terms, to interrogate the cultural and conceptual discourses that underpinned its existence, and to reflect upon the many ways in which the history of European empire has shaped the modern world in which we live today.

       This module will offer a comparative study of the armies of the Great Powers during the First World War. The module will adopt the war and society approach to this topic and so will focus on the social composition and combat effectiveness of the armies concerned, along with civil-military relations and the higher strategic direction of the war. This module will therefore seek to answer some of the key questions of the Great War: how did the Great Powers manage to raise and sustain such large armies, why did soldiers continue to fight, given the appalling casualty rates; how politicised were the armies of the Great War, why were politicians allowed to embark on foolhardy military adventures, how crucial were the Americans in securing Entente victory and how effectively were economies adapted to meet the demands of the armies? Comparative topics for discussion in seminars will include; planning for war, recruitment and conscription, the officer corps, generals and politicians, discipline and morale; and attitudes to technological advances.

       Focusing on the history of modern Germany in the Twentieth Century, the module examines major changes and continuities in the development of a highly advanced, industrialised but also militarised European nation state which played a central role in shaping the modern European geographical and political landscape. The module explores the end of the Imperial Monarchy after the end of the First World War in 1918, the role of the Allied reparation demands, hyper-inflation and political instability of the Weimar Republic, and the rise of National Socialism and the Third Reich during the 1930s. The course will chart the influence of anti-Semitism, racial eugenics and geopolitics in Germanys quest for world domination during the Second World War and assess the legacy of the Holocaust in defining post-war German identity and society. By examining the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the module will take a critical look at the politics, ideology and day-to-day history (Alltagsgeschichte) of East and West German society during the Cold War, and explore the underlying factors which led to the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and subsequent German reunification.

       Society has always been fascinated by those deemed different and over time, unusual people have been viewed and constructed in a myriad of ways.  The course explores the continuities and changes surrounding those classed as different. Broadly, the course will investigate the changing nature of difference from the 1780s to the 1920s. It will examine the body and mind as contested sites; spaces occupied by those considered different; the establishment of normality versus deviance; the changing conceptions of difference over time; relationships between unusual people and the wider society. Using a broad range of sources, from novels to film, the course will trace the shifting cultural constructions of difference.

      PO653 - Marxism

      
      
       The module is aimed to introduce students to Marxist theory and to enable them to assess both the contemporary and historical significance of Marxism in world politics. Students are expected to read some of the key texts of Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels and to consider varied interpretations and critiques of Marxist methods, writings and theories. Students are also expected to consider the political contexts in which these theories and debates emerged and their implications for political practice. Students are not expected to demonstrate any detailed knowledge of the history of Marxist-inspired governments, regimes or political movements.

      PO652 - Politics in the Classroom

      
      
       The module will begin with training sessions for the students in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of politics drawn from the national curriculum. These sessions will be run by the Partnership Development Office.After training the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a school in Spring term (this session includes time to travel to and from the School, preparation and debrief time with the teacher and in class time with the teacher and pupils  3 hours in total). They will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a topic or talk about aspects of university life. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of citizenship and politics within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project (final taught lesson) in consultation with the teacher and with the module convener. They must then implement and evaluate the project.

      PO646 - Presidents, Parliaments and Democracy

      
      
       This module introduces students to central debates about the influence of different executive formats on democratic government. The course examines the differences between and within presidential, parliamentary and semi-presidential constitutions and examines their consequences for the quality of democracy and for policy outcomes. The course initially focuses on identifying the key institutions and processes that shape the behaviour and strategies of politicians in the executive, before moving on to consider the consequences of these for governance, policy-making and democratic stability. Throughout the central focus is on understanding the extent and the ways that formal political institutions may shape how politicians respond to citizen preferences, bargain with each other to resolve political conflict and choose policies. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about the impact of political institutions on politics, different ways of conceptualizing and measuring democratic performance and encouraged to think about how a broad range of other factors may interact with constitutional formats to shape outcomes. The approach used will be broadly comparative and will use case-specific and cross-national evidence from both developed and less developed democracies in all regions of the world.

      PO638 - Political Behaviour in Britain

      
      
       The module examines the nature of political behaviour in Britain today.  It focuses on two key issues.  The first is the way that citizens participate in politics.  The module explores the nature of political participation, and how this has changed in the last few decades.  It also examines the characteristics of people who participate, and the factors that motivate individuals to engage in different forms of political participation.  The second key issue examined is voting behaviour.  The module considers how far electoral decisions are shaped by stable sociological factors, and how far voters today are less closely aligned with parties and more open to the influence of particular policy messages, personalities and media coverage.  Alongside this focus on the behaviour of citizens, the module also considers the activities of key intermediary organisations, such as legislators.  Throughout, the module seeks to develop students understanding and analytical skills, by considering theories and models of political behaviour along with the way data and other evidence can be brought to bear in testing the validity of these models.

      PO645 - Market States and Post Democracy

      
      
       This module is situated at the interface of political theory and political economy. It seeks to explore the complex and multi-faceted links between democracy and capitalism in the period from 1848 to the present day. The particular focus is on relations between the state and the market as well as the evolution of different democratic regimes and market economies. Similar emphasis will be on conceptual issues and empirical evidence (though no statistical or econometric skills will be required).The first part of the module examines the formation of 'market-states', beginning with a critical discussion of this concept. This will be the starting point for a wider engagement with Smithian, Marxist, Keynesian and neo-liberal accounts. The focus will be on those who theorise the conditions for the convergence of state and market. The second part turns to the evolution of democracy in relation to capitalism. A brief survey of the recent post-democracy literature will be followed by a discussion of key concepts. Examples include the conception of capitalism and democracy as "quasi-religions" (Walter Benjamin) and various arguments that formal democratic representation and abstract capitalist exchange engender a "society of spectacle".

      PO654 - Politics of Deeply Divided Societies

      
      
       This module explores the linkages between mediation theory and the practice of conflict resolution in deeply divided societies. Topics include the theory and practice of negotiations, conflict escalation and peace mediations while specific emphasis will be given to the role of regional or international institutions in early conflict prevention. The module applies negotiation theory in the study of state disintegration, demographic and environmental conflict, property rights, federal management and transitional justice. The course engages with the core literature in negotiation theory and exposes students to a number of simulations aiming to improve negotiation skills (identifying best alternatives, revealing or not preferences, identifying win-win arrangements, defeating spoilers and exercising veto rights). Because of the practical skills taught in the module and the interactive nature of in-class simulations, students are expected to attend lectures and tutorials.  Finally, the course examines the role of citizens and community organizations in peace mediations focusing on a number of selected case studies from deeply divided societies specifically Israel/Palestine, the former Yugoslavia, South Africa, Greece/Turkey (including Cyprus & the Kurdish issue), Rwanda and Northern Ireland.

      PO655 - Public Opinion and Polling

      
      
       Democracy rests on the will of citizens.  But how can we identify this will?  Elections are one method; but more regular expressions of citizen views are possible via opinion polls.  Indeed, a range of public and private bodies routinely use polls to identify popular attitudes.  But what are the opinions supposedly revealed by these polls, how do surveys go about identifying opinions and how valid are their results?This module introduces students to the theory and practice of public opinion and its measurement.  The module focuses on two main questions.  First, what is public opinion?  How far do peoples attitudes pre-exist and how far are they instead shaped by the way questions are asked?  Are attitudes informed and considered, or are they largely knee-jerk responses based on little information?  If, in fact, citizens know little about politics, are there ways in which they can, nonetheless, form meaningful views on important public issues?  The answers to these questions are central to the task of assessing the proper role of public opinion in modern democracies.  The second question asks how public opinion is measured.  What are the main features of social surveys, and how well do they measure public attitudes?  This section of the module pays particular attention to the ways that different types of survey can affect the responses that people give, and to the principles and practices of effective survey design.

      PO656 - Humans at War

      
      
       This module aims to investigate the different roles and experiences of human beings at and in war. Following an introduction to issues regarding agency (How do people act in the social world? How much freedom do they have? What impact can their actions have?), the course will examine the roles of combatants (both state and non-state), civilians (men, women and children), and third parties (peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, journalists, and academics). The module will draw on academic literature, but also written, oral and video testimony and artwork to examine these categories first as a social group (examining questions such as age brackets, income brackets, education, life expectancy), then in terms of their political functions and roles, and finally in an attempt to access some degree of experiential knowledge of war and peace. Due to the sensitive nature of the material examined, the module will not be using lecture capture.

       This module will look at the political lives of three of the icons of contemporary world politics: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi. The module will begin with a brief introduction to biographical narrative as a method in political science. We will then discuss these three figures in three blocks of three weeks each, leaving one week for a concluding and comparative discussion (and one reading week). Throughout the module, the key themes of the title  resistance, suffering (sacrifice) and leadership  will serve as a focus as the module considers the lives of Gandhi, Mandela and Suu Kyi and their impact on world politics. Each block will first discuss the political life of the leader in question, after which one week will be devoted to some of his/her key primary writings, leaving one week to consider the meaning of resistance, suffering and leadership in each of the three lives.

      PO658 - The Rise of China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of Chinas hegemonic role in pre-modern East Asia and its political development since the 1840s when it was forced to open up to the outside world and to lay a solid foundation for even more detailed study of present-day China. It deals with a recurrent theme in the study of Chinese politics, that is, how successive Chinese leaderships since the 1840s have reconciled Chinese indigenous political culture with models of modernisations that originated in the West. Focus is on how indigenous and foreign models for state-building and political development have guided Chinese thinking about national rejuvenation and modernisation. This module assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history or politics, and introduces students to the defining features of the Chinese traditional political system, including: Confucianism and Legalism, the causes of the demise of imperial China in 1911, the abortive attempts of republicanism and constitutionalism between 1912 and 1949, the rise of communism, and major political events since 1949 as well as its recent ascendancy. Questions to be explored in this module include: Why did the Chinese imperial system fail to meet the challenges and encroachment from the West and Japan? How did Chinese leaders understand modernisation? Why did Chinese political elites embrace communism? What have been the impacts of revolutions on Chinas external behaviour and relations, post-1949? How has Chinas worldview been socially constructed in its interactions with Western powers? What is Chinas grand strategy for development in the early 21st century?

       This course will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the recent political history of Northern Ireland. The course will be accessible to all students, whether they are new to the topic or not. The main objective of the course is to provide students with a greater understanding of one of the most complex regions within the United Kingdom. Students who take the course will learn about the central issues that underpinned community conflict, why sectarian conflict broke out in the region in the late 1960s, why it continued for so long, and what political dynamics led to the peace process of the 1990s. In addition to looking at the conventional historical and political development of Northern Ireland, the course will also focus on wider aspects of the society such as representations in Irish poetry, music and sport, and the way in which these have mirrored political and cultural relationships within the region.

      PO665 - Advanced Topics in Politics and International Relation

      
      
       This module is designed to offer Stage 3 Politics and International Relations students an opportunity to study a topic in politics and international relations at an advanced level. Participation will be limited to students who have demonstrated strong writing and analytical skills in their Stage 2 coursework (with a minimum average of 60%) and the topics may vary from year to year depending on the research and teaching interests of academic staff. The module will build on the concepts, theories and methods that students have acquired in their previous studies, introducing them to more advanced readings and further developing their knowledge and understanding of the scholarship at the forefront of their discipline in a given issue area. Students will work very closely with academic staff and will benefit from their research expertise and individual feedback in a small group setting. The module will assist students in developing their critical and analytical skills and help them to understand the uncertainty, ambiguity and limits of knowledge concerning their advanced topic in politics and/or international relations.FOR THE 2015/2016 ACADEMIC YEARThree topics will be offered: two in the Autumn Term and one in the Spring Term. Students may only take one topic within this module. Topic title: Global Gender Justice (Autumn Term)This module addresses some of the complex issues regarding achieving justice for women internationally through a thematic examination of classical and cutting-edge scholarship in the areas of gender, security, and human rights. We will interrogate practices of representation of women as victims and explore the cultural, religious, political, and social challenges and barriers to achieving gender justice within the family, the community, the state and global society. We will analyse the effectiveness and limits of international organisations, international human rights instruments, NGOs and activists to bring about change in womens lives. The seminar will be guided by an overall aim to explore the extent to which gender inequality within the state has an impact on state behaviour, with a specific focus on state development and state security. Students gain an awareness of the following themes: the situation of women around the world; the ways in which gender affects social, political, and economic status; the evolving study of gender in international politics (with an emphasis on security and human rights); the political implications of scholarship; and the links between gender, feminism, and activism. The seminar requires previous knowledge of international relations, but will introduce students to feminist theories relevant to the study of gender in international relations. The two-hour weekly seminar will involve a close reading of key texts as a group as well as discussion/debate of the weekly topics. Topic title: India in the twenty first century (Autumn Term)This course introduces students to the central issues and dynamics that define Indian politics today, situating these within their historical development. It examines the shifting dynamics of Indian party politics, the politics of economic reform, the causes and consequences of ongoing economic inequalities, the politics of welfare as well as the Maoist insurgency and its links to conflicts over economic redistribution. The course also examines the politics of identity focussing on how differences of caste, religion, language and region and the often violent conflicts these entail. It will then examine gender relations situating these in the context of social change and shifting power relations. Finally the course discusses the main issues and problems of Indian foreign policy, in particular Indias often fraught regional relations and the search for global power status. In the course of studying these topics, students will be introduced to the key scholars, themes and debates that have defined the political science and political economy literature on India. It does not presume any prior knowledge of Indian politics.Topic title: Russia and its Neighbours (Spring Term)The crisis over Ukraine from 2013 was stark demonstration of the failure to establish an inclusive and mutually legitimate system of European security and international politics after the end of the Cold War. On the one side, Russia was treated as a defeated power, even though the country did not see itself as such, and was assigned a modest role in world affairs. In the end this provoked a type of Weimar syndrome in a country whose dignity and interests were perceived to have been ignored. On the other side, the European Union and NATO have claimed to be advancing a type of post-modern politics in which traditional Westphalian notions of balance of power and geopolitical interests have given way to a benign notion of economic and normative homogenization. Two contrasting visions of world order came into contestation. The module will examine the evolution of Russian foreign policy since the end of the Cold War and its interactions with the EU and N

      PO669 - Conservatism: Politics and International Relations of the Right

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to familiarise students with the conservative tradition in modern politics. This is achieved by reference to a range of key conservative thinkers selected by the module convenors to help students understand the diversity of the conservative tradition and consider what factors help to cohere it. Comparison within the tradition and across a variety of thinkers is achieved by examining these thinkers views on four basic categories of modern politics, namely the state, the market, society and international relations. In order to meet these broad learning outcomes, essay questions will be designed in order to ensure that students have to compare at least two thinkers. The module is structured around lectures and seminars. The module will be team-taught, allowing for a wider range of teaching and research expertise from both module convenors.

      PO667 - War and Peace in International Society

      
      
       The purpose of the module is to enable students to critically engage with the International Society (or English School) approach to International Relations. Combining political theory, IR theory, philosophy, sociology, and history this approach seeks to understand the theory and practice of international politics by reference to the historical development of relations between large scale political entities (from empires, hordes, kingdoms, to the modern nation-state and beyond) and the discourses that have emerged (Machiavellian, Grotian, Kantian) in response to the development of first European international society and eventually world society. The course focuses on the central features of international society - war and peace - as they have been conceived by the three traditions and members of the English School from Martin Wight to more contemporary figures.

      PO666 - Religion and International Politics

      
      
       This module introduces students to the complex set of questions surrounding religion in international politics. The module begins by exploring contending political and sociological understandings of religion at the turn of the 20th century. It looks, in particular, at the constructed nature of the categories of the religious and the secular, and at the limits of the secularization thesis, which anticipated the privatization, decline and ultimately disappearance of religion in modernity. The discussion then turns to the relation between religion and secularism in Europe  with a focus on the question of European identity, multiculturalism, the relation between Europe and Islam and the numerous controversies surrounding Islam in Europe  and in the United States  with a focus on the concept of civil religion and the role of religious rhetoric and thinking in US foreign policy, particularly in the so-called war on terror. The module then explores the relation between religion and violence by looking at the role of the 16th and 17th wars of religion in the process of modern state formation and by asking whether there is a genuine connection between religion and violence. The concluding part of the module focuses on the emerging concept of the postsecular, its contending meanings, understandings and possible applications by focusing on the case of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

       The course provides an overview of the broad field of international conflict analysis and resolution. Students have the opportunity to explore the motivations driving different forms of conflict, including interpersonal, group and civil violence. Students will also be exposed to a range of theories and approaches used to understand violent conflict, and a number of different methods of conflict resolution (e.g. negotiation, mediation, peacekeeping operations, and transitional justice.) The approach is interdisciplinary and juxtaposes traditional approaches used to study conflict management with new scientific studies of conflict and cooperation.

       On any one day in Brussels hundreds of negotiations on European Union (EU) legislation take place on issues ranging from the regulation of financial services in Europe to the promotion of democracy in the EUs near neighbourhood.  The purpose of this module is to introduce students to the negotiation system that is European Union, how it has evolved politically since its creation and how it works, both in theory and in practice.  Students gain an in-depth understanding of the dynamic of European integration over time and the politics behind this process of integration.  Students will analyse the functioning and roles of the EUs main institutional bodies, investigate how legislation is produced and implemented and how the various political actors with a stake in EU decision-making interact both formally and informally. The module also addresses key political questions underpinning EU decision-making EU, such as political support for the EU amongst its citizens, the EUs underlying democratic legitimacy and finally its future development.

      PO612 - Policy-making in the EU

      
      
       Since the mid-1980s the EU has experienced an intense period of constitution building with the ratification of more than five amending treaties.  These treaty changes have significantly altered the Unions policy-making process both in terms of competence and policy reach.  Nearly every area of domestic public policy now has some European dimension.  At the same time the EU has also experienced deep economic crisis and increased questioning of the purpose and trajectory of European integration and policy-making.  The focus of this module is on the European Union (EU) as a system of public policy-making at the heart of all these changes. The module will address topics including: the evolution of various flagship EU policies including the Single Market programme, environmental policy, economic and monetary policy, foreign, security and defence policy, and justice and home affairs.  At the end of the module, students will be able to conceptualise and contextualise key developments in EU policy-making.  They will also be able to analyse the kind of political and economic order that has emerged in Europe today as well as the various challenges it faces.

      PO616 - The Politics of Trust (in the USA)

      
      
       Much recent academic and popular commentary has focused on citizens supposed mistrust of government, especially in the United States of America. The central aim of the Politics of Trust is to uncover the reasons for Americans malaise. However, students will also examine other western democracies where trust has fallen to see if these countries experiences can inform our understanding of the US case specifically and the politics of trust more generally. The course begins with a history of trust in America, with an overview of the putative reasons for declining trust in the post-World War II period, with an examination of the experiences of other western democracies. The second part turns to the specific explanations for declining trust as posited by academics and political commentators. Explanations include the crisis of government performance, spin, the internecine warfare between Republicans and Democrats, the changing nature of the modern labour market, declining social capital, and the media.

       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of China's political development in the 20th and early 21st centuries. After a brief overview of China's political history since 1949, it is designed around two core blocks of study.The first block looks at the principal political institutions that include the Communist Party, the government (the State Council), the legislature (the National People's Congress) and the military (the People's Liberation Army).The second block examines the socio-political issues and challenges facing the country in its ongoing development. They range from the prospects of democratisation and the growth of civil society, the issue of quality of life in the areas of the environment and public health, corruption, nationalism and ethnic minorities, national reunification, territorial disputes with neighbouring countries to China's engagement with global governance.A major theme of the module is to address why the Chinese communist regime is more durable and resilient than other non-democratic countries in achieving both economic growth and political stability and acquiring international influence, despite the fact that it faces numerous mounting development and governance  challenges.

       Anglo-American countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, along with many Western European societies, have long prided themselves on their respect for liberal values. More recently, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and agitation for rights and civil freedoms in many Asian countries, liberalism has extended its reach as a source of political thought and action. Liberalism's values, practices and institutions are now admired, emulated, invoked and desired in many parts of the world. In this module, we look at liberalism as a philosophy of politics by studying the work of some of its major contemporary exponents and detractors. We examine the different approaches to liberalism advanced by figures such as John Rawls, Richard Rorty, and Will Kymlicka. To complement our understanding of liberalism, we consider the communitarian criticisms from thinkers like Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, the feminist criticism of liberalism by Susan Moller Okin, and the post-structuralist criticisms from Michel Foucault.

       PO590 gives students an opportunity to write an 8,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice, thus allowing them to become specialists in the subject area they find most interesting. A series of lectures and seminars will guide students through the research process from turning research interests into proper research questions, to choosing a method, to designing the research, and to conducting the research. Students will also have supervisors who will be able to advise them on how to make effective progress with their projects. PO590 gives interested final-year students an opportunity to creatively apply what they have learned in their programmes in order to produce a showpiece of academic work, which can be used as a writing sample in support of applications for jobs or admission to graduate studies. The module also includes the PO590 Student Conference (normally held on the Friday of the Spring term reading week), where students present their projects and preliminary findings.Students with a poor record of coursework submission and with an average of coursework grades of less than 60% across all their Stage 2 modules will not be allowed to attend PO590. If you register for this module but fail to meet these conditions  good record of coursework submission and an average of 60% or higher in Stage 2 coursework grades  you will be asked to change your registration and select alternative modules.

       This module focuses on European foreign policy, i.e. the external dimension of European politics, exploring the relationship between Europe and the rest of the world. Following the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU now stands poised to unleash significant foreign policy potential in its neighbourhood, and beyond. The difference between the EU and Europe will be examined in component fashion through the foreign policies of some of the major European states. Thereafter, the foreign policy tools of the EU will be looked at, after moving into an in-depth thematic treatment of the key foreign policy issues facing the EU vis-&agrave;-vis its security, defence, economic, trade and development relations, and its dynamics with rising powers, the US, its eastern and southern neighbours in Central Europe, Asia and North Africa. Other issues include its burgeoning military capacity and a growing set of overseas military missions. Broader themes will include the impact of global developments on Europe, the international significance of European integration and the more general role of Europe in the new world order This course will draw on theories from political science and international relations and concepts defining Europes global role.

      PO563 - Foreign Policy Analysis and Management

      
      
       This module examines the complex relationship between foreign policy analysis and foreign policy practice.  It does so by exploring shifting approaches to making and examing foreign policy, including the contributions of  IR theory to Foreign Policy Analysis. Historical antecedents of foreign policy as a practice are examined via observations of traditional bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, followed by traditional state-based actors, non-state actors, and the nature of the structure they inhabit. FP decision-making is then examined, followed by the process of foreign policy implementation. The issue of motivation is tackled through analyses of the largely domestic impact of culture, interests and identity and broader effect of intra-state norms, ethics, the issue of human rights. Case studies of key countries reinforce the practical implications of above-mentioned issues throughout the module.

       This module will examine the domestic politics of Japan, starting with the changes made by the American occupation. We will then explain the institutions and informal practices which maintained long-term one-party-dominant rule of the LDP (1955-1993). Attention will be paid to electoral rules, the government and opposition parties, collusion between the LDP/business/bureaucracy and voting behaviour.Attention will then move to how the system has changed since the 1993 election which saw the LDP lose its majority. We will analyse the successes of Koizumi and the new era of post-Koizumi politics. We will assess the current Prime Minister and how he is running Japan. We will analyse the 2009 DPJ government and assess its' successes and failures. The module will end with assessment of the Fukushima management of the disaster and the new LDP government.

      PO675 - Politics and IR Internship

      
      
       This module blends practical workplace experience, in the form of an internship in the area of politics and international relations, with taught seminars and private study. The internship will allow students to experience first-hand the practical application of their degree subject in the wider world of work, and will provide the opportunity to develop transferable skills such as teamwork, communication and self-organisation. The taught seminars will provide an opportunity to reflect upon, and develop, knowledge of the sector and its relationship with the academic field of study, using the students internship experiences and a range of other resources. This will include input from School staff and alumni working in relevant fields, as well as appropriate support from employability and careers-guidance professionals.It will be the students responsibility to source and apply for internship opportunities, but assistance will be provided both by the Schools Employability, Internships, Placements and Alumni Relations Officer, and the Universitys Careers and Employability Service. These opportunities should be in an organisation whose aims and activities are broadly related to politics and international relations, and the internship should reflect these activities and give the student the opportunity to work in a way which allows the module learning objectives to be achieved. Students on pre-approved School-administered internships (currently those based with Kent Union and the Representation of the EU Commission to the UK) will also be eligible to take this module. The internship must consist of at least 60 hours of work, but this may be spread across a number of days / weeks and need not be a full-time position. The module convenor will approve of all internship opportunities prior to their commencement and students are advised to liaise closely with the module convenor and other appropriate staff in good time. Internships must finish by the date of the final seminar, and the School will provide all documentation  and relevant insurance  / health and safety checks  to ensure that the placement meets both University and sector requirements and guidance on work-related learning opportunities.

      PO634 - Understanding US Foreign Policy: War, Trans- formation and Terror

      
      
       This module offers a comprehensive study of US foreign policy since 1945. Ranging from containment, democratic enlargement, and the war on terror the module introduces students to the concept of grand strategy and the need to understand the broader intellectual platform and foundations of the way in which the United States engages with the world. A number of case studies are used to explore this such as the work of George Kennan, the Vietnam War, and the move towards smart power under presidents Bush and Obama. In addition  to this the course also explores questions on the social construction of state identity in the American national consciousness and how both the media and political elites help to shape public opinion and attitudes that relate to Americas friends, allies, and enemies. The course also explores the concept of soft power as a method of extending American influence and power in the world and questions the idea of American decline.

      HI5022 - Science, Power and Politics in Twentieth Century Britain

      
      
       This module covers the period approximately 1900-79 and follows the fortunes of H. G. Wells open conspiracy  his scheme by which scientists would rule the world.  The aim is to understand what scientists (and their friends and critics) thought was the social role of science during this period, and how they sought to make sure that science played that role.  We aim to find out why scientists thought a scientific approach to life and society was desirable; how they sought to impose it; and to what extent, or in what ways, they were successful in their aims.  Along the way we will see how scientists engaged with particular political ideologies, and with the government.  Examples covered include the poverty vs. ignorance nutrition debate during the great depression, the development of nuclear power and consumer technology at the Festival of Britain.  We will see the pivotal role played by WWII in terms of facilitating scientists ambitions to govern, and the rise of psychology as arguably the most influential science in terms of governance.  The module makes particular use of fictional and documentary film sources as a means to understand the place of science in public culture.

      HI764 - How the West Was Won (or Lost): The American West in the Nineteenth Cen

      
      
       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation. The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis. Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars. Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape. A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion. Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates. Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

      HI6024 - Napoleon and Europe, 1799 - 1815

      
      
       A decade ago John Dunne, in a review article, described Napoleonic history as a poor relation of the French Revolution that seemed on the verge of making good. These prophetic words described well the growing interest among scholars in Bonapartes ambitious Imperial mission extending beyond Frances natural frontiers. The work of historians Stuart Woolf and Michael Broers has postulated that the Napoleonic mission to 'integrate Europe under a single system of governance' could be viewed as a form of 'cultural imperialism in a European setting.' This special subject will introduce students to the pros and cons of this historiographical debate. It will give final year students an alternative means of engaging with the familiar historical category of Empire. There is no shortage of source material translated into English relating to this period. Indeed the memorial de Saint Helene has been available to the Anglophone world since 1824. Consequently a critical and in-depth engagement with primary material will be one of the priorities of this special subject. The focus on French expansion abroad, in the early nineteenth century, challenges one to move away from understanding the Napoleonic Empire in national terms; this course in essence, by its very nature, is European in both scope and content. To do this it will explore processes of acculturation and international competition on a thematic basis. It will examine, in broad multi-national manner, the complex interaction between centre and periphery or what Italians, more prosaically, describe as conflict between stato reale and stato civile. Napoleon was his own best advocate when it came to forging his posthumous legacy. Students will be encouraged to appraise critically his memoirs and understand that behind claims of progress lay a brutal struggle for the fiscal military resources of Europe. Yet, even more important will be to consider that while the military and political effects of the grand Empire were ephemeral, it created a judicial and administrative edifice which survived well beyond 1815 and continues to shape European civilisation to this day. Of course, laws do not merely structure the powers of governmental action but have a complex impact on notions of citizenship, the economy and culture (especially family life). This special subject will investigate the Napoleonic Empire in its many facets. Students will be urged actively to pursue their individual interests in either war and society, Empire, political culture and/or gender.

      HI6029 - The Great War: British Memory, History and   Culture

      
      
       The aim of this course will be to show how far the Great War has infiltrated into modern culture and to test the validity of Paul Fussell's thesis that the Great War created Britain's modern cultural atmosphere. Fussell contends that modern society is marked by a love of irony, paradox and contradiction formed by the experience of the Western Front. Against this theory we will set the ideas of Samuel Hynes and Martin Stephen, as argued in their works, A War Imagined and The Price of Pity. This course will explore how the Great War has influenced our lives and why we have certain images of it. Why, for example, do most people associate the Great War with words such as 'waste', 'futility' and 'disillusion'? Why does the morality of the Great War seem so tarnished, while the Second World War is conceived as a just war? The course will be based upon literature (high and popular), poetry, art, architecture and film. We will therefore be 'reading' a 'primary text' each week. The course will serve to highlight many of themes of the 19th and 20th century British survey courses and will further contextualise the course on Britain and the Home Front in the Second World War.

       'At the height of the imperial age church people liked to argue that religion and the British empire were inseparable - that the visible, commercial and political empire was woven into the fabric of another, invisible country - a spiritual empire.' Hilary M Carey, Empires of Religion, p. 1.This module will critically interrogate Careys above assertion by asking how far can missionaries be considered agents of imperialism? In so doing it will interact with issues of how we define imperialism, how useful the idea of cultural imperialism can be to the modern historian, and how we might talk meaningfully about 'the colonising project'. Students will be introduced to the history of the British Empire and more broadly the history of British cultural engagement and encounters with indigenous peoples within and outside of the empire. You will analyse and discuss the socio-economic, cultural and religious impact of Christian mission in the 'age of expansion', and will tease out issues of cultural encounters, indigenous agency and resistance, race, racism and cultural chauvinism. We will explore the impact of mission literature and experience on the British public's own imaginative engagement with non-western peoples, and will use an exciting and diverse range of textual, visual and oral sources. Students will emerge with a complex understanding of colonialism, in all its variegated forms, and how it has shaped (and continues to shape) the modern world in which we live today.

       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

      HI6014 - Riders on the Storm

      
      
       The module will study the economic, environmental, social and political crisis of the fourteenth century, which had a long-term impact on the population of the British Isles and beyond. The fourteenth century was a troublesome period in European history. After some two centuries of economic growth, demographic expansion and relative social stability, Europe entered the era of harsh socio-economic crises, bio-ecological shocks, climatic deterioration and political turmoil. The ubiquitous Four Riders of the Apocalypse, as seen by the contemporaries, brought much hardship upon all strata of European society. The Black Death of 1348-51, whose nature is still debatable, killed about 40 per cent of British population and altered the land-to-labour ratio, leading to far-reaching social and economic changes within the society. Violent and costly wars of England against Scotland and France commanded increased taxation, caused supply shock, high transaction costs and hence high prices and low real wages. Between 1314 and 1322, there was a series of failed harvests, brought about by continuous torrential rain and exceptionally cold winters. This agrarian crisis, or the Great Famine, caused starvation and malnourishment, chiefly among the lower echelons of the society. The famine spread chaos and anarchy over the country, with crime rates going up. To these should be added another significant biological crisis: mass cattle mortality of panzootic proportions, which ravaged the whole of Northern Europe and decimated its bovine stocks. This period can be regarded as truly a watershed one in British, and European history, and there is no doubt that it has changed the existing economic and social order forever.This module will look at each and every of these crises and at the interaction between them. A particular attention will be given to reading primary sources, shedding much light on our understanding of these crises. In addition, each class will involve a reading and discussion of one scholarly work (an article, or a book chapter) related to the subject.1. An introduction to the Fourteenth-Century Crisis: themes, sources and problems2. In the wake of the storm: thirteenth-century prosperity and growth3. The problem of overpopulation in Europe c.1300: Malthusian Crisis?4. The famine of 1315-21: the worst subsistence crisis in the West ever recorded?5.

      HI5032 - African History since 1800

      
      
       This module is meant to introduce students to the key processes and dynamics of sub-Saharan African history during the past two centuries. The course covers three chronological periods: the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. In their study of the pre-colonial period students, will especially familiarize themselves with the changing nature of African slavery and the nineteenth-century reconstruction of political authority in the face of economic, environmental and military challenges. The colonial period forms the second section of the course. Here, students will gain an understanding of the modalities of the colonial conquest, the creation and operation of colonial economies and the socio-cultural engineering brought about by European rule. The study of the colonial period will end with an analysis of African nationalisms and decolonisation. In the final part of the course, students will develop an understanding of the challenges faced by independent African nations. The nature of the post-colonial African state will be explored alongside such topical issues as the Rwandan Genocide and the African AIDS epidemic.

       This course will examine this key era of US history by examining the key political and social events, developments in the history of ideas and historiographical controversies from the victory over Mexico to the final withdrawal of US troops from the South. It will focus on the changes that occurred and the changing interpretations of them. Students will be able to see the interplay of forces and ideas that led to a conflict that few, if any, wanted and lasted for longer than anyone expected. Historical and fictional depictions in art and film will be evaluated for the ways they shape perspectives. The key historical topics include the rise of slavery as a public issue in the late 1840s, the attempts to find compromise within the Constitutional framework, the activities of the extremists, the changing nature and goals of the war, the effects the war had on both sides, the plans for the post-war period, the changing elite and popular attitudes, the nature of the final, pragmatic arrangements that the country accepted.

       When Charles I became king of England in March 1625, he also inherited the thrones of Scotland and Ireland. This module will consider politics, religion and culture in Caroline Britain from Charles Is assumption of the triple crown, until he declared war on the English Parliament in August 1642. During this fascinating period, the king pursued controversial policies and eventually faced armed resistance in all three kingdoms  the struggle against the Scottish covenanters (1639-40); the Irish rebellion (1641); and finally, civil war in England (1642). Students will have the opportunity to analyse a wide variety of primary source material, including royal letters, private correspondence, paintings, journals, newsletters, religious documents and state papers. Through these rich sources, students will explore the many factors which shaped the character of Charless government and will be encouraged to draw their own conclusions about the nature and success of the kings approach. Was this a period of relative harmony until the late 1630s or were all three kingdoms on a trajectory towards conflict from the outset of the reign? By the end of the module, students will be able to answer these, and other historiographical questions, including perhaps the most crucial question of all - what were the causes of the British Civil Wars?

      HI6049 - The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the Atlantic World, c. 1500 - 1900

      
      
       This source-based class confronts two of the most sophisticated and contentious historiographical debates of the last century: the so-called Origins Debate about the role of race in the entrenchment of slavery in America in the 17th and 18th centuries and the debates about the place of capitalism in explanations for the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. The course will also confront the role played by political and constitutional change in the development and dismantling of the slave system. Students will consider the character and place of slavery within European and American economic, political, and cultural development. The course will examine the conditions under which slave societies emerged; the part played by empire, and the distinctive combination of ideological and theological strands that produced a compelling challenge to slavery for the first time. It challenges participants to examine the utility, in this context, of such historiographical motifs as: race, slavery (as distinct from the slave trade), liberty, empire, capitalism, mercantilism, humanitarianism, as well as the separation between economics and politics in the development and abolition of slavery. As such, it exposes participants to the history of race, cultural history, intellectual history, political, imperial, and economic history, all within the context of the Atlantic experience. With constant attention to the problem of accommodating slavery within comparatively liberal cultures and societies, this course navigates students through much of modern American, European history, and African history.

       Credits: 60 credits (30 ECTS credits).

      HI6038 - Britain's Home Front

      
      
       The study of war has, until recently, tended to focus upon leaders, combatants and military strategies. This course, however, will analyse the experience of civilians on the Home Front, using World War Two Britain as a case study. Sessions will typically include:Sources for Studying the Home Front 1) propaganda posters, film and radio; 2) Mass Observation; and personal testimonies; the Blitz spirit; The Enemy Within: Enemy Aliens and Jews; Minority groups on the home front: Travellers and Immigrants; Womens war service; Cultural representations of women; Soldier heroes and civilian men; Cultural representations of men; Evacuating the home front; Brief Encounters; Politics I: social policies; Politics II: a swing to the left?; and the impact of war on the home front: change and continuity. There will also normally be a trip to the Imperial War Museum.

      HI6039 - The Rights Revolution: The 20th Century US   Supreme Court & Society

      
      
       This course will look at the central theme of the "Rights Era"- the move in the U. S. from a customary deference to tradition and view of the mainstream to the enforcement of political equality with far less regard for mainstream views. It will examine competing views of what "equality" means and consider the numerous groups that have demanded it since 1945 and the way they both fought for their causes and created the turbulence and confrontation in American society after 1960. These groups include, but are not limited to, African Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women, the disabled, certain religious groups, those who have faced discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, as well as other groups that followed similar legal strategies, such as environmentalists and those who seek greater guarantees of property rights, free speech rights, and gun rights. This not only is an essential topic for understanding the modern United States but as UK is currently undergoing similar legal changes, it has meaning for contemporary Britain.  This course assumes no prior knowledge of American law or of the courts in the United States. It can also include subjects of interest to students not listed above, assuming sufficient materials are available on those topics. It aims to places this groups & their activities in the context of the time and show how the strategies worked (or failed) and the reaction of both elite and general opinion to the claims.

      HI6040 - The Discovery of the World c.1450 - 1800

      
      
       A century after the discovery of the Americas, in a treatise published in 1580, the radical Reformer Jacob Paleologus argued that it was most unlikely that the ancestors of the American natives could have crossed the Ocean and he concluded hence that all humans cannot descend from one single individual, Adam. So the discovery of America not only challenged traditional geographical knowledge, but also questioned fundamental religious, anthropological and historical assumptions. This module will explore early modern encounters with new worlds and with non-European cultures and it will ask about the impressions, which these encounters made and the manifold changes of European life they brought about. Based on the weekly reading of one primary source, we will follow travellers, merchants, scholars and missionaries on their expeditions to the inner parts of Africa, to the court of the Shah of Persia, to China and to the Americas. We will watch them drawing maps of uncharted lands and compose dictionaries of unheard languages. And we will not only listen to European voices, but will also try to reconstruct the experiences and impressions of non-European actors and visitors. The central aim of this module is to discuss the religious, intellectual, political and economical contexts of these discoveries and cultural encounters. We will ask how the various actors organized and methodized their expeditions and how they interpreted their discoveries. The module will also address the consequences, which these discoveries entailed. How did they affect the traditional European ideas about mankind, religion, the world and their position in it? How did they influence European life style, fashion, art and literature? How did they affect the lives, social structures and cultures of the discovered people?

      HI6058 - Saints, Relics & Churches in Medieval Europe c.500-1500

      
      
       Saints were a central feature of the Christian religion in medieval Europe, and they also had a profound influence on culture and society. This module explores the development of the cult of saints from Late Antiquity to the eve of the Reformation. Some of the main topics that will be considered include relics, miracle stories, pilgrimage, and artistic production. In addition to these topics, the module will consider the impact that saints and relics had on the building of churches and the feast days in the calendar. We will look at a wide variety of sources including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, stained glass, church buildings, and saints lives. All texts will be read in translation.

       This module deals with social, economic and cultural changes in late-medieval England, between c.1250 and 1450. It was a watershed period in English history, marking the beginning of the collapse of the old feudal order and the emergence of a new socio-economic regime, which paved the way to the world we know today. The topics include, but are not limited to: manorial system, peasant society, the Great Famine of 1315-17, the Black Death, the 1381 Revolt, changes in consumption culture, the emergence of popular preachers, and the rise of gentry.

      HI6061 - Human Experiments & Human Rights during the  Cold War

      
      
       This Special Subject examines the history of human rights in human experimentation during the Cold War, and traces the development of biological and chemical warfare research from the Second World War through to Allied military research in the 1950s and 1960s. It charts continuity and change in the development of medical ethics standards in modern military research on humans, and assesses the extent to which research subjects were informed of the risks involved in the research. The module explores Allied war-time research and the international response to news of Nazi medical atrocities. The Nuremberg Medical Trial and the Nuremberg Code are important milestones in the history of informed consent and modern medical ethics. The module looks at the nuclear testing programme that was conducted by the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1950s, and investigates in detail the evolving chemical warfare programme at Porton Down in the United Kingdom where one of the servicemen, Ronald Maddison, died from exposure to the nerve agent sarin in 1953. The history of research into incapacitants and biological warfare agents is located into a wider context of an evolving system of medical ethics in which non-therapeutic experiments without consent were increasingly seen as unethical and unlawful. Finally, the attempts by veteran groups for recognition and compensation will be examined as part of a wider political history of the Cold War which has shaped our understanding and memory of the more recent past.

      HI6055 - Literature & History:Text & Context in C.19thScience

      
      
       This module puts together the methods of literature and history.  Its case studies come from nineteenth-century science, as it is in this area of scholarship in which some of the most exciting and stimulating historicist scholarship has arisen of late.  The first term will be spent on a review of various approaches to literature and history, from textual to contextual, taking in, for example, the narrative turn, reception theory and reader-centred studies.  This will be partnered with a slow and in-depth reading of two nineteenth-century texts that have spawned most historicist scholarship in literature and science: most likely George Eliots Middlemarch and Charles Darwins Origin of Species (tbc).  In the second term, students will choose a selection of novels (one per week) for study within the framework of methodologies covered in term 1.  Students will be guided and advised in their choices, which are anticipated to lie in the realm of nineteenth or possibly twentieth-century science.  Students will develop two of their chosen texts for independent research, assessed by means of substantial essays.

      HI6035 - Anglo-French Relations 1904 - 1945

      
      
       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

      HI796 - Inviting Doomsday: US Environmental

      
      
       Condemned by the international community for refusing to sign the Kyoto Accords, rendered powerless by electricity blackouts, and stricken by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the United States of America is today embroiled in a narrative of environmental controversy and catastrophe. This module explores to what extent the USA has been inviting doomsday throughout the modern (twentieth-century) period. Commencing with an introductory session on writing and researching American environmental history, the module is then split into four sections: Science and Recreation, Doomsday Scenarios, Environmental Protest, and Consuming Nature. Over the twelve weeks we will consider a range of environmental issues that include wildlife management in national parks, pesticide spraying on prairie farms, nuclear testing in Nevada, and Mickey Mouse rides in Disneyland. By the end of the module, we will have constructed a comprehensive map of the United States based around themes of ecological transformation, assimilation and decay.

        This module will study the political, religious and social history of England, and also English relations with Wales, Ireland and Scotland in the context of the unification of Britain. The theme of the integration of the realm will be traced from the Yorkist foundation of the councils in the North of England, and in the Marches of Wales, to the creation of Great Britain in the reform debates, the control of the periphery by the centre and the unification of the British Isles under James VI and I. Within this framework subjects such as the royal courts of Renaissance England, the rather different impact of the Reformation in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, the Tudor commonwealth, plantations in Ireland and North America will be examined in the context of the emergence of the sovereignty of the King in Parliament.
