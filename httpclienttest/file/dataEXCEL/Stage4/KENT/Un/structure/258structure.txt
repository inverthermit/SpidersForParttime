Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EC309 - Statistics for Economics and Business

      
      
       The main aim of this module is to provide you with a basic understanding of statistics suitable for the Stages 2 and 3 degree programmes in Economics, Business and Accounting although it is also suitable for students taking other Social Science degrees. This module introduces you to statistical concepts and methods in preparation for Stages 2 and 3 modules in economics; it is a prerequisite for Stages 2 and 3 Economics modules and is a core input to the second year quantitative module, EC511. So as well as learning basic statistics, the module emphasises the interpretation of statistical results; and provides you with the opportunity to apply statistical concepts to economic and business data using calculators and computer software. Work with Excel is an independent study element of the module, and using calculators to undertake basic descriptive statistics is an important focus of the practical problem solving.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO336 - Sociology of Everyday Life

      
      
       Sociology offers insight into how society works. To do this, we question and look behind the common sense view of everything in the social world. This course looks at a range of important and topical aspects of society and explains how we can make better sense of them by thinking sociologically. The aim is to introduce students to the wide range of topics which comprise contemporary Sociology and indicate how social circumstances shape and influence our lives. Why do powerful differences and inequalities between men and women persist even though both are now formally equal? Why, in a world that is safer and healthier than ever before, do we witness so much concern about risks such as to our health, children and security. These are type of questions we will begin to answer. The course is suitable both for those who have studied sociology at A level, and those who have not. There is a considerable emphasis on interactive discussion, through weekly seminar groups.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO337 - Fundamentals of Sociology

      
      
       This course provides grounding in the basic history and assumptions of sociological thinking and research, and how they apply to key aspects of our society. Topics are less from everyday experience than in the Sociology of Everyday Life course, focusing on more abstract topics such as the state and globalization. Students will also be encouraged to consider competing perspectives on these topics and how they might be assessed. There will be a lecture and seminar each week and students will be encouraged to engage in informed discussion and debate. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EC304 - Principles of Economics

      
      
       Economics looks at the material aspects of peoples lives. It is about how people make choices about what and how to produce and consume. It is about how the difference in economic outcomes between firms, people and countries can be related to the effects of choices they and others have made. It builds on the very simple and plausible assumption that people want to get the most they can, given the constraints they face. Studying economics entails both gaining an understanding of the economies in which we all live, and developing skills to think logically about economic situations. The emphasis in this module is on how economics can help us to understand the society we live in.  The module aims to provide a thorough understanding of economics at an introductory level and provides the basis for all subsequent study you may undertake in economics. The first term covers the principles of microeconomics and the second term develops a framework for understanding macroeconomic events and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the module and in the seminars in particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of economics as an analytical tool for thinking about real world problems. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SO408 - Sociological Theory: The Classics

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the major issues and controversies surrounding the definition, development and teaching of classical social theory. It introduces students to the key problems that have set the agendas for sociological inquiry as well as the main concepts and theoretical traditions that have shaped sociological thought.   A considerable debate surrounds the meaning of classical social theory and what should be associated with this term.  For some, classical social theory refers to ideas developed by a generation of thinkers whose works belong to a particular period of our cultural/intellectual history (usually dated c.1880- c.1920). Others understand this as a label for canonical texts that define the project and enterprise of sociology. For many, it simply means the works of Karl Marx, &Eacute;mile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel (the so-called founding fathers of the discipline). Classical sociology has also been identified as a critical tradition of placing society in question so as individuals may be better equipped to understand how their personal troubles are the product of determining socio-economic structures and processes.  Each of these approaches to understanding classical social theory will be explored and analysed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EC305 - Mathematics for Economics and Business Mode A

      
      
       This Stage 1 module is designed for students who have an A -Level in mathematics, AS mathematics or equivalent qualification. A first-year mathematics module (either Mode A or B) is a compulsory part of all economics degree programmes and these modules take place in the Autumn term with a statistics module following on in the Spring term. If you are unsure whether your mathematical background is equivalent to an A level pass, please consult the Module Convenors when you arrive at the University. The aim of the module is to provide you with a good understanding of the mathematics necessary for your Stages 2 and 3 Economics modules.The teaching of each topic starts from first principles, but the speed of the module assumes that you have studied mathematics before (but not economics). By the end of the module, you will have covered the important uses of mathematics in economics (and business) and be able to use many mathematical techniques commonly used to analyse economic (and business) problems. In the long term, the analytical and quantitative skills you acquire from this module are relevant to many different occupations.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO334 - Modern Culture

      
      
       This module introduces students to discussions and debates surrounding modern culture. It looks at why culture has always been such a contested sphere and has a decisive impact on society at large. Students will look at culture in the widest sense, ranging from the arts to the banalities of everyday life in our consumer society; at how culture has expressed and organised the way people think and live from the days of 'protestantism' to those of post-punk. Books, magazines, radio, TV, movies, cartoons, fashion, graffiti, the cult of celebrity, youth subcultures and pop music will be used to understand class, history, sexuality, colonialism, revolution, conflict and globalisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO305 - Introduction to Criminology

      
      
       Crime is a major social and political issue and the source of much academic and popular debate.  Key criminological issues will be examined during the course of the module within their wider sociological and social policy context.  There will be a particular focus on understanding the nature and extent of crime and victimisation, analysing public and media perceptions of crime, and exploring the relationship between key social divisions (age, gender and ethnicity) and patterns of offending and victimisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EC500 - Microeconomics

      
      
       This is the core microeconomics module taken by all students following Economics degrees. It builds on the material covered in the Stage 1 Economics modules. The titles of many of the topics covered will be familiar, but the topics are dealt with in greater depth than in first year.Microeconomics is concerned with the behaviour of individual economic agents such as consumers, firms and governments. It provides the foundations for understanding all types of economics, including macroeconomics, so is relevant for all other Economics modules you take.The module is carefully designed to give (alternative and/or complementary) readings, and provide a set of different types of questions and problems for seminars to test and extend your understanding of the material as well as to improve your key skills such as communication, problem solving, team work, and learning how to study efficiently.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EC502 - Macroeconomics

      
      
       Macroeconomics today is a different subject than it was just a few decades ago. Old controversies have been resolved and new ones have arisen. This module builds on the first year teaching of macroeconomics to provide an intermediate course, which takes full account of the policy issues and controversies in the world macroeconomy.Autumn Term begins by looking at the basic methodology of macroeconomic models. We then examine, in greater detail than at Stage 1, how the macroeconomic theories of aggregate demand and aggregate supply are derived. This involves studying the markets on which these theories are based. It is important to be aware that there are many theories of aggregate demand and supply. This term we use the IS-LM model, with which you should be familiar from Stage 1, to derive a theory of aggregate demand in both open and closed economies. We also examine the labour market to derive a theory of aggregate supply and study the relationship between inflation and unemployment.Spring Term starts with studying the long-run, that is, what determines the standard of living of countries in the long term, as opposed to short-run economic fluctuations. We then study microeconomic fundamentals of macroeconomics to understand in-depth the determinants of consumption, investment, and labour supply decisions. We then use these and the ideas developed last term to extensively examine macroeconomic demand management policies (fiscal and monetary) and their shortcomings. We finally study the role of the financial system in the macroeconomy and the causes behind the recent crisis starting in 2008.

      SO727 - Contemporary Sociological Theory

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to the major issues and controversies that have shaped key developments in contemporary social theory. It surveys the development of social theory through the second half of the twentieth century and up to the present day. Following on from the SO408 module on classical social theory, it questions the distinction between the classical and the contemporary so as to highlight the intellectual decisions, values and problems involved in the packaging of social theory under these terms. It also provides critical introductions to the following theorists and issues:  Talcott Parsons and his legacy; Symbolic Interactionism up to Goffman and beyond; The Frankfurt School: Critical theory and the crisis of western marxism; Jurgen Habermas and the decline of the public sphere; Michel Foucault and a his understanding of power; Pierre Bourdieu and the reproduction of inequality; From Modernity to Post-modernity?;  The feminizing of social theory; Globalization, networks and mobilities; New challenges for the twenty-first century.

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      EC511 - Quantitative Economics

      
      
       The quantitative estimation and evaluation of economic models is an essential feature of the study and application of economics. An alternative title for this module is (applied) econometrics where metric in econometric denotes measurement. Most textbooks provide a useful definition of what is meant by econometrics. Andrew Oswald has described economics as the art of looking for patterns in data. Joshua Angrist and J&ouml;rn-Steffen Pischke have described econometrics as the art of investigating causal relationships of interest. We provide an intuitive treatment of some elements of basic econometric theory in conjunction with the practical application of the methods to economic issues, in particular we emphasise the measurement and interpretation of empirical results. Hence we choose the title Quantitative Economics, even though other techniques are often taught under such a heading; for instance, linear programming and input-output analysis. This also differentiates this module from the final year modules, EC542 and EC543 Econometrics I and II, which explore econometric techniques in greater theoretical and empirical depth. The aim of the module is to familiarise you with the techniques economists use to measure economic relationships in order to test hypotheses, forecast, or assess the impact of economic policy. This is a very challenging field of applied economics. We do this in a practical way so that you gain experience in using suitable computer software to investigate empirical relationships studied throughout the module. Learning to use computer software provides a basic training in information technology (IT) skills which are becoming increasingly important to employers seeking suitable, skilled employees.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EC531 - Policy Analysis

      
      
       This module applies economic theory and statistical methods to the understanding and critical assessment of economic policy. It is designed for students who have completed Stage 1 Economics. For students studying for an economics degree, the module complements the core second year modules by focusing on the policy application of economic concepts and provides an introduction to material studied in greater depth in third year specialist modules. For other students, it provides the opportunity to consider an economists perspective on important policy issues. A key aspect of this module is the relationship of economics to current and ongoing policy problems.The module introduces you to a variety of contemporary, mainly microeconomic, policy issues. Alongside formal lectures, it also consists of several workshops, which provide opportunities to develop and demonstrate your problem solving and analytical skills. They also give guidance on identifying sources in the literature, data relevant to economic research, analysis of data and the presentation of results orally, as well as in writing. This focus provides opportunities to develop a range of highly transferable skills and lay the foundations to the independent learning skills you require for many of the modules in Stage 3.

      EC532 - Environmental Economics, Institutions and Policy

      
      
       This module introduces you to environmental economics and economics generally. A key objective of the module is to help you develop an ability to apply economic thinking to environmental problems. The module considers various aspects of environmental economics including why pollution occurs and how policy can be designed and implemented to deal with it, how to place economic value on the environment and how to understand sustainable development in microeconomic terms.The module is divided into three parts. In Part A we examine the relationship between the economy and the environment. In Part B we consider how environmental policy can be designed, implemented and evaluated in relation to environmental pollution. In Part C we examine issues of environmental valuation, which is a rapidly growing area of research in environmental economics. The emphasis in all parts of the course is to understand the links between theory and practice.

      EC534 - The Economics of Money and Banking

      
      
       The module asks what determines the set of equilibrium prices required to provide an appropriate level of savings in an economy to finance the expected level of expected activity. It tries to link models of money, banking and finance into one generic, or foundation, view. Specifically, we shall move towards an understanding of how financial and economic innovation have moved hand in glove over many centuries and how it seems to be that when finance fails, so does the modern market economy. Some of the questions we consider are: How can we analyse the appearance of money in an economy? What is the link between money and finance? What explains bank runs? Why is it so difficult to explain exchange rates? Can we explain the occurrence of financial crises? This second-year optional module emphasises both historical experience and analytical techniques. The economic analysis of financial markets and instruments is the starting point for understanding financial markets. This module is desirable for students wanting to take EC562 in Stage 3.

      EC538 - Economic Controversies

      
      
       The idea of this module is to teach the skills of economic reasoning and argument by exposing students to the big debates within the discipline and in economic policy. The module draws on current and past controversies across many economics sub-disciplines. This equips students with the ability both to understand and contribute to the debates surrounding the recognised controversies within the discipline at a level consistent with an intermediate undergraduate degree course in Economics. The curriculum also provides an insight into the academic and professional development of the discipline. Four controversies are covered each academic year drawn from a range of topics pertinent to the discipline and relevant sub-disciplines. The list of controversies are framed in the form of a question but can be identified as specific topics as required. The list below is indicative only:1. What should governments do? How far should they intervene in markets, families and the way individuals make choices?2. What is the best way to understand business cycles? What policies can/should governments adopt to help households and firms deal with such fluctuations3. Many economists assume individuals are perfectly rational and fully informed. Is this a sensible and useful way of understanding the economy?4. Is the living wage a good idea?5. How successful were economists at explaining the recent financial crisis?6. Is Free Trade Fair Trade?7. What is the best way of understanding inflation?8. Are currency unions ever a good idea? 9. What is the best way of helping the long term unemployed and their families?

      EC540 - Development Economics

      
      
       There is a wide range of views and approaches to the study of economic development spanning the whole of the political spectrum from the Marxist left to the libertarian right, and also a rich historical literature. To understand the module, some prior knowledge of economic theory and statistics is required, and a willingness to read widely. But the aim of the module is to teach the basic principles of economic development in order to answer such questions as:Why are there divisions in the world economy between rich and poor countries? How did these divisions arise and what forces perpetuate them? How important are such factors as agriculture, industry, investment performance, population growth, domestic finance, international finance and trade in explaining the economic performance of nations? What role does economics in general have to play in an understanding of why some countries are poor and others rich?

      EC541 - Economics Dissertation

      
      
       This dissertation is a 30-credit module based on self-directed study, which allows you to develop a complete piece of work within the general field of economics, from the initial idea through to a final written report. It is unique amongst the modules you are taking towards your degree in Economics, both in the ways that you learn and in the ways that you are assessed. Your learning will be largely independent, but is supported by structured supervision from your dissertations supervisor and weekly computing sessions to help in accessing, coding analysing and interpreting your data.

      EC542 - Econometrics I: An Introduction to Modern Econometrics using Stata

      
      
       This is a 15-credit module in applied econometrics using Stata (the most popular general-purpose statistical software package used by empirical economists), for students who have followed Stage 1 modules in mathematics and statistics and who have taken the Stage 2 module in quantitative methods (EC511) or equivalent. What distinguishes this module is the adoption of the modern learning-by-doing approach to teaching econometrics, which emphasises the application of econometrics to real world problems. The focus is on understanding the theoretical aspects that are critical in applied work and the ability to correctly interpret empirical results.

      EC543 - Econometrics 2: Topics in Time Series

      
      
       Empirical research in macroeconomics as well as in financial economics is largely based on time series, ie chronological sequences of observations, showing the development of quantities, goods and asset prices, and interest rates. The module offers an introduction to contemporary time-series econometrics, linking the theory to empirical studies of the macroeconomy. Topics include: stationary and non-stationary stochastic processes; linear autoregressive and moving average models; linear difference equations; autoregressive distributed lag models; cointegration and equilibrium correction; vector autoregressive models. These topics are illustrated with a range of theoretical and applied exercises, which are discussed in seminars and computer classes.The module introduces you to the research methods used by macroeconomists in academia, government departments, think tanks and financial institutions. It also helps you to prepare for the quantitative requirements of a masters programme in economics.

      EC544 - Economic Integration in the EU

      
      
       The European Union features strongly in all discussions of economic policy and political decision making. Frequently economists are unable to provide a consistent analytical framework for the analysis of the various issues posed. In this module we explore the meaning and analysis of regional economic integration in the context of the EU. This provides a general introduction to the economic rationale for the existence of the EU, the working of some of its main policy areas, and a critique and assessment of the achievements to date. The module deals first with the origins of the EU, the theory of a Customs Union and questions of trade integration. Secondly, it covers the problems and relevance of monetary integration and the common currency area to the process of economic integration. Thirdly, it deals with some specific policy areas, in particular labour market policies, common agricultural policy and competition policy. At the end of this module you are expected to have knowledge of the basic theories underlying customs unions, and of the rationale for, and strength and weaknesses of, policy intervention at EU level. This is a module in applied economics and the emphasis throughout is on the development of appropriate economic theories and their application in the specific context of the EU. It is not concerned with the detailed discussion of the Treaties or the implementation of policy measures. Decision making in the EU is introduced in order to understand the question of the exercise of economic power. The nature of the economic role of the European Union is such that this involves a broad coverage of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, often involving applied issues and applied analysis going beyond that covered in the main theory courses.

      EC545 - Economics of the Labour Market

      
      
       Unemployment has become one of the biggest economic challenges facing many countries, placing the labour market at the core of current economic debate. Understanding the labour market is a prerequisite for informed discussions of issues surrounding the unemployment problem as well as other important topics like discrimination and immigration. The first part of the module follows a fairly conventional approach to the study of labour economics, and covers the supply and demand for labour. We incorporate policy-orientated material throughout  for example, we examine the incentive effects of taxation and unemployment benefits on labour supply, and discuss the effect of pay-roll taxes on labour demand. The second part of the module covers the process of wage determination and unemployment. We analyse the dynamic behaviour of unemployment from a flow perspective (the ins and outs of unemployment) and introduce the role of matching and search frictions to explain the presence of frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment exists because, even if there are as many vacancies as unemployed workers, in a labour market with imperfect information workers and firms need to spend time to meet and create a new employment relationship. Finally, the module analyses the dramatic rise in unemployment in some OECD countries over the last economic crisis, focusing particularly on the role played by the labour market institutions. During the module you attend computer sessions to learn how to solve the labour supply model and the labour market equilibrium with the Excel Solver. The basic function of applied sessions in these labs is to improve your analytical skills in a dynamic and interactive way. The Excel Solver is described as a user-friendly and flexible tool for economic optimisation.

      EC546 - Games for Economics and Business

      
      
       The growing use of game theory by economists suggests that a professional economic education is incomplete without a firm understanding of this new tool. The module aims to introduce you to a topical and important research area of microeconomic analysis, to develop your skills in setting up and solving games that arise in business and economics, and to enable you to apply game theory to different areas of economics and business.

      EC547 - Industrial Economics

      
      
        Industrial Economics studies why and how firms and industries behave and interact with each other. This is probably one of the most important and interesting areas in economics. Understanding firms' behaviour is relevant not only to the firms but also to the governments that design industrial policies in order to favour consumers without decreasing firms' efficiency.During the module, we deal with issues that are present in everyday news: anti-competitive practices, the effect of market power on consumer welfare and the incentives for product innovation, and private and public effects of mergers. You have the chance to discuss and understand many of these topics in a deeper and more economically informed way.This module has been designed for students who have already taken intermediate microeconomics. You are encouraged to apply economic analysis and techniques to understand the behaviour of firms and industries.

      EC548 - International Finance

      
      
       When we open a newspaper or an economics and business magazine, we often read topics related to monetary and financial relations between countries. A good deal of political debate is also focused on the various aspects that constitute international finance. However, these debates do not allow us to understand their theoretical underpinnings. This is what we are going to study in this module from a rigorous perspective. The first part of the module deals with some basic concepts of international macro such as the balance of payments and exchange rates, and arbitrage conditions. We then go on to analyse the impact of opening up the economy on the alternative macroeconomic policies available. In that part we also analyse the main factors that determine the exchange rates between currencies, and the power of the different models proposed. The third part of the module deals with hot topics in international finance. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of fixed and floating exchange rates, the concept of a speculative attack, how to understand current account imbalances from an inter-temporal perspective, and how world macroeconomic imbalances drove the 2008/09 international financial crisis and recent sovereign debt crisis in Europe.The module has both a theoretical and an applied emphasis in order to insert the available theories into the real problems of the world economy. It does not analyse the detailed workings of international financial markets or questions related to firm financial management in international capital markets but students interested in these aspects can acquire basic foundations that are fundamental in understanding the context in which firms and governments work.

      EC549 - International Trade

      
      
       The study of international trade has always been an especially lively and controversial area in economics. Yet there was never a time when the study of international trade was as important as today. The economies of different countries are more dependent on each other than they have ever been before, meaning that, among other things, regional crises can spread throughout the world. Keeping up to date with this changing international environment and being able to understand the dynamics behind it is of key importance to firms and governments.

      EC550 - Monetary Economics

      
      
       This final year optional module covers a variety of monetary issues from both a theoretical and a policy perspective. It starts with an introduction to the role of money in the economy, and theories of money supply and demand. A discussion of the IS/LM model gives a basic foundation for analysing how monetary policy affects the economy, and a first theoretical perspective on the neutrality of money  ie whether monetary policy has real effects on the macroeconomy, in either the short or long run. This is followed by a discussion of other theoretical perspectives on neutrality, and relevant evidence. If monetary policy does have real effects, how are these brought about and what are the implications for monetary transmission? The remainder of the module discusses current issues in monetary policy  the goals of monetary policy and how these are expressed in modern simple models of monetary policy, central bank independence and inflation targeting.

      EC553 - Public Economics

      
      
       To understand and be able to evaluate the role played by government in the economy it is important to understand key elements of microeconomic analysis and then be able to apply this understanding to the practical evaluation of policy issues. Economic theory is typically a positive science with right and wrong answers but evaluating policy issues is a much more normative science where there are often no correct answers (just opinions). The module reflects these two sides of studying public economics.

      EC562 - Economics of Finance 1

      
      
       The economic analysis of financial markets and instruments is the starting point of financial economics and this module provides a concise overview of capital markets. Specifically, it examines how the economics of uncertainty have been applied extensively in financial markets. It focuses on the structure of each financial market (such as the trading volume and investors in it), recommended investment strategies for a specific type of investor, and market conventions. We emphasise both practical knowledge and analytical techniques and several useful mathematical skills are explained. The module first introduces key principles, such as discounting, diversification, no arbitrage and hedging, and then discusses each asset class, such as bonds, equities and their derivatives (instruments), emphasising the general idea behind them. Although different types of assets require different methods of valuations and risk control, the basic principles are common to all asset classes. The module also covers asset liability management (ALM) and other related topics.

      EC563 - Economics of Finance 2

      
      
       The module develops your skills in asset pricing and your understanding of the theoretical basis of this subject. It stresses practical training in asset pricing. The two main topics in the module are investors utility maximisation and arbitrage theory in derivative pricing, which is mainly discussed in discrete time models. The most important goal is to give you the ability to apply the model to real data.Although the module requires some mathematical techniques, its aim is to offer practical training, putting stress on the intuitions and heuristics behind theorems and formulae, rather than their rigorous derivations and semantic definitions. Moreover, you are not only expected to understand theories but also expected to master how to use them.

      EC565 - Extended Economics Essay

      
      
       The module aims to provide an alternative to the EC541 dissertation option for students. In this module, rather than conducting an original piece of research, you are given a set of questions with readings. You can also construct your own question so long as it is approved. You choose a question and (with help from your supervisor) write a 5,000 word essay on this question. The material covered in these essays is typically broader than that explored in the dissertation option and there is no requirement to make any 'contribution to knowledge'. However, the essays still demand more independent work than required for coursework in other modules. You are expected to read round the question AND to assimilate concepts and ideas not covered in lectures.

      EC567 - Economics of Gender, Children and the Family

      
      
       This is a 15 Credit Stage 3 optional module in applied labour and family economics. Its aim is to introduce you to a broad range of the methods and models applied by economists on family related issues. These issues include partnership formation and dissolution, intra-household allocation, education, investment in children, and inter-generational mobility, as well as work and pay from a family perspective. These phenomena are modelled as the outcomes of rational-choice processes, with hypotheses concerning these choices evaluated in the context of relevant empirical evidence. We focus on public policies influencing decisions within families such as fertility, labour supply and investment in human capital of children.

      EC568 - World Economic and Financial History from the 19th Century

      
      
       The aim of the module is to introduce you to the evolution of the world economy from the 19th century to the present. This period experienced rapid growth of trade, saw a massive migration from Europe to the Americas and the rise, fall and rise again of globalisation. A knowledge of the history of the world economy in this period allows us to understand todays world economy better; enlightens our understanding of world income inequality, trade patterns and sources of growth; and teaches us important policy lessons from past recessions and recoveries.Topics covered on the module include growth and trends pre-1913 and the interwar years; the gold standard; commodity and labour market integration; the Great Depression; and recovery from the Great Depression.

      EC569 - Economic Growth

      
      
       This module covers a variety of growth issues from both empirical and theoretical views. The first part of the course deals with basic concepts of economic growth, including how to measure growth and the core theories of economic growth. The second part deals with productivity; how to measure productivity and analyse different sources of productivity growth. The third part deals with economic fundamentals, including the relationship between government policies, income inequality, and growth. The aim of the module is to teach the basic principles of economic growth in order to answer such questions as:- what are the determinants of growth?- how can we improve productivity?- what kind of role does the government play on growth? - why are there differences in the level of income among countries?

      EC570 - Microeconomics of Development

      
      
       In the last 30 to 35 years, the study of economic development has increasingly focused on the behaviour of individuals  their opportunities, constraints, and choices  to understand the causes and nature of poverty, and on formulating strategies for improving their economic well-being. This trend includes the increased application of microeconomic theories to understand phenomena related to underdevelopment, the collection and analysis of data at the individual level (as opposed to the regional or national level) and, most recently, the use of lab and field experiments to better understand individual behaviour. The module introduces you to these trends, to show how the related microeconomic tools have contributed to a better understanding of the process of economic development. Some of these methods are now widely used by international development agencies  such the World Bank and DfID  as well as academic researchers to critically assess development strategies and evaluate programmes aimed at improving the economic well-being of the poor in developing countries.

       This module introduces you to agriculture, food and natural resource economics and economics generally. A key objective is to help you develop an ability to apply economic thinking to problems in this area. The module considers various aspects of agricultural, food and resource economics including food production, economic theory related to agricultural policy, food supply chains and food prices, food economics specifically food labels and various economic aspects of natural resource management such as forestry and fisheries. The module is divided into three parts. In Part A we examine the relationship between the economy and the agriculture. In Part B we consider aspects of food economics. In Part C we examine various issues relating to natural resource.  The emphasis in all parts of the module is to understand the links between theory and practice.

       Contraception, abortion, and teenage pregnancy are the subjects of public controversy in Britain. This module takes these aspects of reproductive health as its main examples. We will consider why contraception, abortion and teenage pregnancy became the subject of policy-making, and look at how policy about them has changed over time. Attention will be drawn to areas of debate that are currently particularly controversial, to encourage students to consider the ways in which policy could develop.

      SO601 - Welfare in Modern Britain

      
      
       This module provides students with basic accounts of the scope and scale of the British welfare system, and the theoretical basis for its existence and growth. The recent history and current organisation of the main areas of social welfare provision such as social security, education, health, social care and housing are explored. These services which comprise the welfare state are situated in the broader context of welfare provided from non-state sources: the family, the market, community and voluntary sector and debates regarding how welfare should be provided and funded. The module examines how policies are formulated and the processes through which they are implemented and revised. It also considers the impact that social policies have on social inequality and difference based on class, ethnicity, gender, disability or age. Welfare in Modern Britain is a core module for those taking Social Policy and related degrees, but is also relevant to those with an interest in contemporary social problems and the policies aimed at addressing them.

       In this module you will begin to understand the process and debates surrounding how researchers learn more about the social world. What techniques and approaches do social researchers draw upon to organise, structure and interpret research evidence? How do we judge the quality of research? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the range of frameworks and methodologies? The first part of the module introduces you to the conceptual issues and debates around the best way to explore social questions, forms and issues, and an overview of some popular methods for doing so. In the Spring Term, you will spend most of your time applying what you have learned in a group research project and an individual research design project.

      SO603 - Health and Health Policy

      
      
       This module will introduce students to the analysis of health policy focusing on recent policy changes in the UK and identifying the major influences which have shaped these policies.  There have been considerable changes in health service policy and health policy in the UK over the last decade involving changes to existing policies and the development of new policy themes. The latter have included a growing recognition of the need to address inequalities through public health policies but the relative neglect of environmental health policies, a focus on the views and/or the voice of the user and the public, the emergence of evidence-based policy and practice, the marketisation and privatisation of health care, the introduction of managerialism and the attempts to regulate the medical profession. This module provides an analysis of these recent policy developments and explores to what extent they reflect significant shifts in policy. What shapes these policies is examined through an exploration of the influence of professional medicine and other occupational groups including CAM, the pharmaceutical industry, the State, patients groups and the wider global environment. It links analysis of the theory of policy making with an analysis of empirical examples.

       The course is concerned with the relatively new ideas of living in a risk society which theoretically capture the heightened sensitivity within Western societies to the numerous risks which shape our lives. The course will explore basic concepts of risk, hazard and probability and how risk is managed and communicated. Topics will include risk and globalization, and risk and the media. Developments will be examined through key examples such as mad cow disease and genetically modified frankenfoods. The course will suggest that heightened perception of risk is here to stay, and is leading to a reorganisation of society in important areas.

      SO668 - The Sociology of Work

      
      
       Work and economic life is one of the central themes of sociology. Work allows us to think about class, gender, race and issues of identity. Work defines how people live their lives and is a major constituting factor in identity formation. In recent years work has changed enormously with the rise of globalisation, of deindustrialisation and the ending of old certainties which used to underpin working lives. This module examines how sociology and sociologists have looked at the issue of work in the past as well as in contemporary societies. It charts the theoretical background to the assumptions sociologists make about work as well as the methods they use to investigate work and employment. The module will focus on issues industrialisation, deindustrialisation, notions of career and identity and places and spaces of work. A major part of this module is the discussion of innovative ways of looking at work including through visual methods and approaches, and in addition it will draw on material from the arts and humanities.

      SO676 - Cultures of Embodiment

      
      
       Images of trim, taut and terrific bodies surround us in contemporary consumer culture. They look down on us from billboards, are increasingly central to advertisers attempts to sell us clothes, cosmetics, cars, and other products, and pervade reality television programmes based on diet, exercise and extreme makeovers. These trends have occurred at the same time that science, technology, genetic engineering and medicine have achieved unprecedented levels of control over the body: there are now few parts of the body which cannot be remoulded, supplemented or transplanted in one way or another. In this course we explore how culture represents and shapes bodies, and also examine how embodied subjects are themselves able to act on and influence the culture in which they live. We will seek to understand the relationship between the body and self-identity, embodiment and inequalities, and will explore various theories of the body. In doing this we range far and wide by looking at such issues as cyberbodies, religion, food, film, transgenderism, sport, music, work and sleep. Embodiment is the enduring theme of  this course, though, and we will explore its many dimensions via a range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives, and by asking and addressing a range of questions such as How and why has the body become increasingly commodified?, Why has the body become increasingly central to so many peoples sense of self-identity?, If we live in a culture that has been able to intervene in the sizes, shapes and contents of the body like never before, have people have become less sure about what is natural about the body, and about how we should care for and treat our bodily selves?.

      SO678 - Caring for Vulnerable Adults: Understanding Social Care

      
      
       Social care is of central significance in the support of a range of vulnerable adults. As such it is one of the key services of the welfare state, though one that often loses out to higher profile concern with medical care.   In this module we trace the development of social care from its origins in nineteenth century philanthropy, through its consolidation as a key service within the post war welfare state, to its current state of flux as it becomes increasingly fragmented and subject to new models of provision. The module looks at the care experiences of people with physical disabilities whether acquired in childhood or as result of accident or illness later in life; with learning difficulties; and mental health problems; as well as frail older people, exploring user perspectives and questions of empowerment.   It also addresses those who provide care and support in the form of family carers and paid workers, whether social workers or care assistants, addressing policy debates concerning the role of the state and family in provision.  It analyses the key social and policy debates in this field: for example: can we afford the cost of the rising numbers of older people? What role does ageism play in recent scandals about the quality of care provision? How can we support family carers?  How do we integrate people with learning disability into wider society?  In doing so it raises issues of funding, affordability and the mixed economy of care, as well as addressing fundamental questions about how disability, age and care are experienced and understood.

       This module aims to enable students to design and conduct their own piece of research. This can be primary research where students collect and analyse their own data, or it can be library based, where students research existing literature or re-analyse data collected by others. The research can be about a particular policy or policy area, social problem, social development, or matter of sociological interest. The dissertation will usually be set out as a series of chapters. In order to assist students with designing and writing a dissertation a supervisor  a member of staff in SSPSSR - will have an initial meeting with students (during the summer term of Year 2 where possible) and then during the Autumn and Spring terms students will have at least six formal dissertation sessions with their supervisor. These may be held individually or with other students. In addition there will be two lectures by the module convenor which will also support students progress.

It will concentrate on how the Internet in particular has challenged some of our more traditional notions of identity and self, the body, relationships, community, privacy, politics, friendship, war and crime, economics, among others. Lectures will show how some of the basic components of culture such as notions of identity, space, the body, community, and even the very notion of what it is to be human, have been complicated by the rise of virtuality and cyberspace. We will also examine these issues through case study phenomena unique to digital culture, currently including gaming, music, cybersex and social networking.

      SA503 - A Future for the Welfare State? Social Change, Challenge and Crisis

      
      
       Welfare states face many challenges in the contemporary world. This course takes a comparative approach by systematically analysing key fields to show how a variety of countries have identified and tackled problems of social policy. It starts with a consideration of theoretical frameworks but most of the course is directed at consideration of welfare issues in different countries and to specific topics: globalisation, migration, population ageing, disability, the cuts and so on. In this way, the student is provided with a systematic overview of some of the main areas in which international and national social policy agendas co evolve. It is intended for students of social policy, social work, and social sciences.

      SO736 - Sociology of Religion

      
      
       This module covers key issues and debates in the sociology of religion in order to interrogate the significance of religious practice and belief in the modern world. After an introductory lecture, the module is organised into two connected parts. Firstly, it explores classical statements on the sources, meaning and fate of religion in modernity by examining the writings of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel, and using their analyses to interrogate current events (e.g. prosperity Pentecostalism, the rise of the supernatural in culture through such media as the Harry Potter novels, and violent responses to transgressions of what religions consider to be sacred). The emphasis here is on developing in students the knowledge and skills necessary to appreciate and engage critically with the significance of religion for the development of sociology, and with key statements about the modern fate of religion in and beyond the West. Second, the module explores core issues concerned with and associated with the secularisation debate. Here, we look not only at conventional arguments concerning secularisation and de-secularisation, but also at the significance of the return of the sacred in society, civil religion, the material experience of religion, and the manner in which religious identities and habits are developed in the contemporary world. This enables us to develop new perspectives on the viability of religion in current times.

      SO737 - Literature and Society

      
      
       This course will provide students with a sociological understanding of the changing and central importance of literature (in its myriad forms, both fiction and non-fiction) for contemporary society, including the emergence of specific genres which reflect the changing demographics and social and political concerns of Britain, as well as some other societies. These genres and concerns have been articulated through a diverse array of protagonists in contemporary literature, varying in terms of gender, sexuality, religion, and class. Not only do we talk of chick lit, but we also read and consume books about vampires and zombies as symbolic vehicles of social otherness. Contemporary literature enables us to examine the ways in which texts address the past, changing social norms, the process of self-discovery and revelation, and the changing boundaries of private and public, in increasingly diverse societies. This module will also emphasize the importance of literature in fostering social reflection, through the ways in which important moral and ethical concerns are often addressed in a variety of genres. While most of the texts are relatively recent, this module also includes a small number of older works of ethnography.

It may also be taken as a 'wild' option.The module invites students to explore the critical links between emotion, media and culture in the context of contemporay cultural, socio-political and economic relations. It examines what is meant by the affective turn within the humanities and social sciences and introduces students to a range of interdisciplinary literatures concerned with theorising the cultural politics of emotion and the mediation of affect.  Through various case studies and examples, the module investigates how social, cultural and media theorists have addressed the relationships between emotion, affect, power and identity in the context of postcoloniality, multiculturalism, neoliberalism and various social justice movements.Attending to contemporary cultural debates concerning happiness, empathy, hope, fear, hate, disgust and melancholia, it explores how personal feelings are linked to social norms and power structures and considers how we might disrupt an assumed division between good and bad emotions.  The module explores how emotions, feelings and affects are produced, mediated and circulated through a range of cultural forms, practices and technologies, paying particular attention to the role of film, television, news media, digital culture, literature and popular science.

      SO506 - Popular Culture, Media and Society

      
      
       This is a core module for Cultural Studies programmes, but is also open to and suitable for students on other programmes in the Social Sciences and Humanities. It may also be taken as a wild option. In each term, the module examines theories and analyses central to the development of the study of culture within two distinct trajectories.In the Autumn term, the module introduces and applies ideas in critical, cultural and communications theory to debates and issues surrounding media and popular culture, focusing on such themes as cultural elitism, power and control, the formation of identities, the politics of representation, and the cultural circuit of production and consumption. It investigates the relationship between the development of contemporary society and societal values and the changing technological basis of mediated culture. In the Spring term, the module combines theoretical and methodological approaches to examine how our understandings of the past, present and future are mediated and remediated in social, cultural and political contexts. Over the course of the term, it will debate and critically explore the relationship between lived experience, memory and the imagination, the politics of cultural heritage and how social myths are developed and used in the construction of cultural identity. It will question how we think about what constitutes cultural history, how we envisage the future and our role in both.

      SO509 - Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       Health, illness and medicine are by no means static concepts. Their meaning has changed over time, and there is competition and conflict over what they mean. For example, in recent decades, health has come to mean much more the absence of disease. This is the age of healthy eating, sexual health, holistic health, healthy lifestyles and healthy living. We live in a time when medicine can mean homeopathy or acupuncture, as well as heart surgery and vaccinations. Health is also something we seem to worry about, and panic over; recent years have witnessed high profile scares about eating beef, using the contraceptive pill and mobile phones, and giving babies the MMR vaccine. Health, Illness and Medicine discusses key ideas and concepts developed by social scientists that can help us understand these, and other, aspects of our society.

      SO525 - Environmental Politics

      
      
       Environmental issues have become central matters of public concern and political contention. In this module we shall consider explanations for the rise  and social distribution of environmental concern as well as the forms of organisation that have been adopted to address environmental questions, including the emergence of global environmental issues and the responses to them. The development of environmental protest, environmental movements and Green parties are central concerns, but we shall also consider the greening of established political parties and political agenda.  Is it realistic to expect the development of a global environmental movement adequate to the task of tackling global environmental problems. The approach is broadly comparative and examples will be taken from Europe (east and west), North America, Australasia and south-east Asia.

      SO532 - Mental Health

      
      
       This module introduces students to the sociological approach to understanding mental health. It begins by outlining historical definitions of mental health and how policy and practice have changed over time from incarceration in large institutions to present-day community care. Sociological perspectives of mental illness (for example, the sociology of suicide, labelling and social causations of mental ill-health)  are considered alongside psychiatric and psychological approaches to treating people with mental illnesses. The module then looks at social inequalities in relation to opportunities to recover, including gender and race, as well as where sufferers are within the life-course (including young people and older people with dementia).Mental health and the criminal justice system as well as religion/spirituality and faith are also explored.  Please note, as this is not a clinical module material covered will not include in-depth investigations of specific diagnoses of mental illnesses.

      SO535 - Youth and Crime

      
      
       This module provides students with a sociological and criminological understanding of contemporary issues relating to young people, crime and deviance. More specifically, the module provides a critical understanding of young peoples involvement in crime and deviance and the various responses to youth crime, especially how young people are dealt with by the youth justice system.

We will then go on to focus in depth on several substantive topics, including gangs and violent crime; drugs, alcohol and nightlife; young people, urban space and antisocial behaviour; and the youth justice system in England and Wales. Throughout the module, attention is given to the importance of understanding the connections of youth crime with race, class and gender and at the same time, engages with key theoretical ideas and debates that inform our understandings of youth crime. This unit provides an opportunity to engage with the most up-to-date debates in an area of great interest in contemporary society.

      SO537 - Race and Racism

      
      
       What is meant by racism? Charges of racism are seemingly everywhere  in the workplace, in the streets, in everyday interactions. But what exactly is racism? Is it beliefs about racial inferiority or superiority? Is it found in actions and consequences whether people intended to be racist or not? We will first review various theories of racism, and critically assess how changing conceptualisations of racism arise in specific, socio-political contexts. We will also consider whether a colour-blind future is desirable and/or possible.

      SO538 - Childhood, Society and Children's Rights

      
      
       This module provides a broad-based introduction to the concept of childhood, its historical evolution (including contemporary influences arising from new technologies and electronic media) and its 'social construction'. Within this context, different perspectives on childrens rights are examined, contrasting those which emphasise children's vulnerability and need for forms of protection and others which argue for children's participation, empowerment or even liberation. The module will also examine contemporary social problems e.g. child labour, sexual exploitation in terms of understandings of childhood and children's rights. Although there are no formal co-requisites for this module, its subject matter fits well with that covered in SA531 The Care and Protection of Children.

      SO702 - Sociology and Social Politics of the Family

      
      
       Often presented as the most natural form of human organisation, the family's changing nature over time indicates it is no such thing. Particularly since the Second World War, driven by the transformation of women's position within society, the very idea of a typical family has been called into question. The numbers of those choosing to live alone in contemporary society even calls into question the very notion of family at all. This module explores how the family has changed historically in its role and relationship to the individual and society. We trace the development of the modern, private family and how it has been shaped by socio-economic, cultural and political pressures. We will particularly focus upon the tension between this private 'haven in a heartless world' and a society anxious about the family's apparent instability.Synopsis of the curriculum The social history of the family and its transformations. The sociology of the public/private split The evolution of policies relating to family life  The individualisation thesis The economics and obligations of the family Recent social and demographic changes considered to underlie the problem of  the contemporary family (changes in fertility patterns, in marriage and co-habitation, the rise of single person households)  Debates about specific current policies about parenting  Critiques of state intervention in family life

      SO710 - War, Atrocity and Genocide

      
      
       This is an interdisciplinary module on war, atrocity and genocide. Drawing on a range of sources from military history, social psychology, sociology, criminology, political ethics and political history, it is concerned to explore the following questions: What is war and why is it a matter of criminological and sociological interest? What are the defining experiences and emotions associated with war and genocide?  How is killing in war framed or constructed in the minds of those who kill? What is mass killing/genocide and how is it accomplished and facilitated in war? Why is rape used so widely as a weapon in conflict situations and what is its lasting impact? What is genocide and how should it best be understood? How are atrocities in war denied, excused or rationalized? The aim of the module is to provide a framework for thinking about (1) the phenomenology of killing in war; (2) the conditions which facilitate genocide and mass killing at the state and sub state level; and (3) the ways in which perpetrators of mass killing, their apologists and distant others contrive to deny, rationalize or legitimize mass killing/genocide
