This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      LL310 - Foundations of Language 1: Sounds and Words

      
      
       The module will begin by offering a basic introduction to the description of speech sounds, with emphasis on those used in English and detailed descriptions first of consonants, and then of vowels. The gaps between sound and orthography will be highlighted as the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbols are learned. The course will then move from phonetics (the study of speech sounds) to phonology (the study of the sound systems in language), focusing on the phonotactics (rules of co-occurrence) and general phonological rules of English. Students will use this knowledge to explore and describe different accents of English. From phonology, the module moves to morphology (the study of word-structure), highlighting the differences between derivational and inflectional morphology, and introducing analytical concepts such as the morpheme and allomorphy, and critically evaluating descriptive models such as word and paradigm, item-and-process and item-and-arrangement grammars. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LL311 - Foundations of Language 2: Structure and Meaning

      
      
       This module introduces linguistic approaches to the study of language structure, language meaning and communication. For language structure, the module provides an overview of the major grammatical properties of English (e.g. lexical classes, grammatical functions, phrase and sentence structure), and provides students with analytical tools for understanding and constructing arguments about linguistic structure (e.g. morpho-syntactic tests, constituency tests).  For meaning, the module introduces students to lexical semantics (the meanings of words and characteristics of word classes) and sentential semantics (how the meanings of words and phrases combine to create propositional meaning). In addition, the module covers introductory topics in pragmatics, focusing on context dependence and the differences between semantic and pragmatic meaning. . The relationships among related but distinct notions such as grammar, inference, and communication are discussed throughout. The module is particularly useful for students who are studying linguistics, psychology, anthropology, language(s), or literature, as it provides them with analytical skills for understanding language and language-related behaviourThis module introduces linguistic approaches to the study of language structure, language meaning and communication.

      IT312 - History of Italian Cinema:The Legacy of Neo-Realism

      
      
       This course will introduce the students to the work of some of the major Italian filmmakers who contributed to Neorealism's aesthetics and contents (Rossellini, De Sica, De Santis, Fellini) and those who have been inspired by them from the Fifties to the present. Through the study of the history of Italian cinema, students will become familiar with some of the most relevant issues of the history of Italian culture and society. The course will focus particularly on some periods of the history of both Italian cinema and Italian society:- The 1940s: Neorealism as a rejection of the fascist film industry ('Telefoni bianchi/White Telephones' and 'Calligrafi/Calligraphers') and as a way of representing Italian society in the years between the fall of fascism and the birth of the Italian Republic. - The legacy of Neorealism in the Fifties: Fellini - the decline of Neorealism into the so-called Pink Neorealism during the years of 'Ricostruzione (Reconstruction) and the Cold War- The legacy of Neorealism and its influence on Hollywood mainstream industry (with special focus on gangster films)- The legacy of Neorealism on contemporary Italian cinema (e.g. Moretti, Sorrentino, Garrone).

      IT301 - Learning Italian - Beginners

      
      
        This is an intensive module in Italian for students who have no or very little knowledge of the language. This course will be of particular interest to anyone wishing to widen their knowledge of Romance languages and to those intending to spend time in Italy. Key basic grammatical structures will be taught through the means of purpose-designed Italian language course books. The students will use the exercise book to carry out grammar exercises at home, which will then be corrected in class. The students will practice their aural skills by listening to audiotapes and videos both in and outside the class. Each chapter of the coursework book is theme based (travelling, shopping, family, etc.). The students will learn how to write and speak in Italian by acquiring new vocabulary, key grammatical points and by carrying out role-plays / presentations. All these aspects relate to the themes in the coursework book. A range of materials will be provided to the student and will for the basis for discussions, translations and applied exercises. Some cultural background of Italy will be provided (e.g. geography, art, music, culinary etc.) The students will also be expected to carry out simple translations from Italian to English / English to Italian. The texts provided will be extracted from the web or the coursework book itself. These translations will also relate to the themes covered in each chapter of the coursework book. By the end of the course the student will have covered key grammatical areas including: the present tense, the future, the gerund, and basic pronouns.

      IT508 - Learning Italian 2 (Intermediate)

      
      
       This module has been planned as the natural follow-on for those who have recently, successfully taken a beginners Italian course such as IT301, and who should have covered the basics of grammar, acquired a stock of high frequency vocabulary and reached a degree of proficiency beyond GCSE and approaching A-level. (A2-B1 in terms of the Common European Framework of Reference {CEFR}).At the same time the course is designed to prepare students for their third year studies and exams in Italy. IT508, like IT301, is an intensive course which requires serious commitment.

      IT552 - Italian Short Story

      
      
       This module focuses on a number of Italian contemporary short stories. More specifically, it discusses the literary treatment of love, and the love story, in the short stories of some of the most important Italian writers of the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century. Works by worldwide renowned authors such as Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese and Leonardo Sciascia, accomplished "postmodernist" writers belonging to a younger generation such as Antonio Tabucchi and Pier Vittorio Tondelli, as well as less celebrated authors such as Gianni Celati, Erri De Luca and Fabrizia Ramondino will be taken into consideration. While not underestimating the profound economic, social and political changes that Italy underwent during the last sixty years, particular emphasis will be given to the similar way in which all these writers seem to fictionally conceive of the love relationship as a missed encounter. In spite of the manifold forms of love being described in these texts (between husband and wife; wife and lover; young boy and ideal father; sister and brother; mother and daughter; two young men, etc.), all the short stories chronologically analysed in this module seem to rely on Calvino's provoking suggestion according to which the missed encounter is the "fundamental element" of love relationships.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      IT556 - Catching the Tide: Cultural Renewal in 20th Century Italy

      
      
       Despite her incomparable heritage, Italy experienced for many centuries a sense of cultural provincialism, with the world's intellectual curiosity switching to Paris, London, New York and other centres of innovation. This module focuses on the clear connections between rapid socio-economic and socio-political change and the thrust for cultural modernity that made 20th century Italy once more a key contributor to the literary and visual arts in Europe and beyond. A wide variety of Italian "texts" of the first seventy years of the 20th century will be taken into consideration, including novels, plays, short stories and films.

      LL537 - English Language in the Media 2

      
      
       In this module, students continue to develop and explore the themes introduced in LL536 English Language in the Media 1. Here, the focus is on semiotics as applied in the linguistic analysis of a wide range of media discourse types, but with particular emphasis on advertising. Areas covered include: semiotics, the work of Saussure, the British press, multimodality, the new media and social networking.. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will further develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the acute importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL538 - First Language Acquisition

      
      
       This course will start by examining the topic of language acquisition, demarcating the domains for linguistic inquiry. It will challenge everyday assumptions about the way in which children acquire language and introduce key theoretical issues, always assessing the validity of each theory on the basis of empirical evidence. The course will examine the biological basis of language and its localisation and lateralisation, using evidence from both typical and atypical populations. It will evaluate the role of input in language acquisition and the extent to which this facilitates linguistic development. All these issues will be set against an understanding of the normal stages of language acquisition, essentially mapping out the linguistic milestones reached by typically developing children to the age of four. An understanding of the interaction between the components involved (phonology, morphology, semantics, rudimentary structure, pragmatics) will provide the empirical backdrop to assess the efficacy of theoretical models introduced. The course will end, having laid the foundations for students to undertake a higher level of research in this area.

      PL602 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      LL512 - Language Processing

      
      
       This course will focus on the structure of lexical items, the way in which these different lexical items are stored and the nature of the relation between them. Relevant theoretical work in the fields of psycholinguistics and language processing is outlined and discussed. And students will evaluate the efficacy of these theories on the basis of experimental investigations which they themselves will construct and conduct, for example word association experiments, lexicon decision tasks and parsing phenomena.

      LL513 - Language Variation and Change

      
      
       Weeks 1-4 will explore the reasons for the initial exclusion of extralinguistic (ie. social) data from linguistic theory, and the limitations of traditional dialectology, before exploring some early variationist studies by Trudgill (Norwich) and Labov (Marthas Vineyard; New York) and examining their theoretical bases. Weeks 6-7 will examine the advances brought about by network studies (e.g. Lesley Milroy in Belfast), and the extent to which they offer a challenge to traditional assumptions in sociolinguistic methodology, an issue to which we return in week 8, which critically evaluates the so-called sociolinguistic gender pattern. Weeks 10-12 focus more specifically on issues of change, looking initially at neogrammarian theories and then the claims of Trudgill, James Milroy and others that certain kinds of change are predictable in specific types of social arrangement.

      LL518 - Stylistics: Language in Literature

      
      
       This module is concerned with the stylistic analysis of literature and is based on the premise that the decision to study literature is also a decision to study the expressive mechanics of language (and vice versa). Attention is given to all three main genres (poetry, prose fiction and drama); thus the module is divided into three blocks according to the kind of text analysed. The first section examines poetry and considers topics such as patterns of lexis, phonetic and metrical organisation and the relationship to meaning; the second looks at fiction through patterns of style variation, inferencing and speech thought presentation; the third examines drama and considers topics such as the patterns in turn-taking and their relationship to the roles and functions of characters, speech act analysis and styles of politeness behaviour. At all stages of the module, the social and cultural context of the works studies will be an important consideration. Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL519 - Syntax 1

      
      
       This course will introduce students to one aspect of formal linguistics, specifically syntactic theory. Syntax will be defined as one aspect of a persons grammar, to be distinguished from the lexicon, semantics, morphology, and phonology. Focusing on the structure of sentences, the course will examine the principles according to which phrases and structures are formed, as well as speakers knowledge about the structural well-formedness of the sentences they hear and produce. Students will gradually learn to draw syntactic trees that can represent the syntactic operations that they will be introduced to. They will learn to conduct syntactic tests on English and cross-linguistic data, thereby becoming versed with the empirical method. The course will combine both minimalist and earlier government and binding work. We will examine the competence/performance distinction, the notion of I-language, poverty of the stimulus arguments, levels of representation, phrase-structure rules, constituency tests as a means for testing phrase structure, case theory, theta theory, binding and movement.

      LL522 - Morphology

      
      
       This course is an introduction to morphology and to the practice of morphological analysis. By focusing on a range of phenomena, including those falling under inflection, derivation, and compounding (both in English and in other languages), the course helps students develop tools for pattern observation in data, description and analysis of word structure, and hypothesis testing. Students will also gain an understanding of the role of morphology in the grammar and how it relates to other components, such as phonology, syntax and semantics.

      LL524 - History of British English

      
      
       The module will begin with a consideration of what the term English means, and of what other, potentially rival, languages have been spoken in the British Isles. It will then consider how successive waves of conquest shaped the sociolinguistic situation to one of di- or triglossia, with English one of a number of varieties used in a restricted set of socially determined domains. Using Haugens standardization model, we will examine the factors which led first to selection and later acceptance of English as the dominant variety, and consider the associated linguistic processes of codification and elaboration of function. Working with short texts from different time periods, the module will then show how and why grammatical changes occurred in Anglo-Saxon, Old and Middle English (e.g. loss of case marking, gender, weakening of the verbal paradigm) and their consequences for the modern language. We will also consider phonological changes (e.g. the Great English Vowel Shift) and their consequences for dialect differentiation. We will conclude by exploring ongoing change in contemporary English (notably koineization in major cities), and the likely consequences for future English in the British Isles.

      LL525 - The Study of Speech

      
      
       This course is an introduction to the linguistic study of speech. It covers how speech sounds are produced and perceived and what their acoustic characteristics are (often referred to as phonetics), as well as how speech sounds are organized into sound systems cross-linguistically (often referred to as phonology). Emphasis will be placed on the sound system of English (including dialectal variation) but basics of sound systems across the worlds languages will also be briefly covered and contrasted with English. Finally, the course will cover the differences between the traditional static view of speech sounds as articulatory postures and the organization of running speech, together with the repercussions that our current knowledge about running speech has for our understanding of phonological systems, their organization and formal representation.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL530 - Writing In The Media: A Practical Approach

      
      
       This module is aimed towards students who are considering a career in journalism, freelance writing, publishing and related fields, but will also be of great use to those with a general interest in the area of media and language studies. It enables students to put into practice theories and methods of discourse analysis by producing their own portfolio of journalism and media-related writing. The course functions as a useful and complementary sister module to LL510 Creative Writing: A Stylistic Approach, but can be taken independently. A consideration of the impact of new media (multimodality) on the field will form a substantial component of the modules content. Students will carry out their own research, for example using Canterbury and its environs as their news area, collecting information, arranging and carrying out relevant interviews, and writing up projects. They will produce and submit a portfolio of original journalism in which they demonstrate their ability to use the English language and to structure their writing with the target audience in mind. Accompanying this, students will submit a critical commentary in which they will reflect on how an understanding of relevant discourse, stylistic and narratological theory has impacted on their writing. The module will be structured along both theoretical and practical lines, with 2-hour workshops based on input, analysis and practice.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL532 - Learning and Teaching Languages

      
      
       This module examines the principles on which contemporary second language teaching methods are founded. It will analyse first and second language acquisition theories in the light of current developments in language learning and teaching theories. Students will analyse a range of language teaching methods taking into account the ways in which they reflect acquisition theory.   The module will give students the opportunity to compare L2 teaching methods from the perspective of: form, function and meaning and student and teacher roles. This will allow students to evaluate the effectiveness of specific language teaching methods. Students will have the opportunity to discuss the ways in which context directly influences the choice and implementation of L2 teaching methods, and will be able to follow personal interests by investigating language teaching methods in context.  Although the focus is primarily on learning and teaching English, the language acquisition  theories and L2 teaching methods examined in this module may also apply to the teaching  and learning of any language.

      LL533 - Topics in Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will focus on extending students critical understanding of pragmatic meaning. Central areas of linguistic pragmatics, such as conversational implicature, maxims of conversation, and principles of politeness and speech acts are outlined, discussed and evaluated critically. The module also explores controversies over the universality of the aforementioned theories, looking more closely at how human interaction is based on different cultural scripts and encouraging students to reflect upon and discuss the cultural influences which impact meaning in a range of intercultural communicative settings. Students will also have the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of pragmatic theories on the basis of empirical investigations, familiarising themselves with the related methodologies and tools of analysis.

      LL534 - Semantics and Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will introduce the students to the study of meaning at the levels of semantics and pragmatics. The discussed topics will range from the study of word meaning to the study of sentence meaning and utterance (contextualised) meaning. The module will introduce significant notions and theories for the field of semantics and pragmatics, such as theories of concepts, Truth Conditions, the Gricean theory of conversational implicatures, Speech Act theory, and Politeness theory. The students will have the opportunity to reflect upon real data and analyse the processes of conveying and understanding meaning at the semantics/pragmatics interface.

       This course builds on the student's knowledge of semantic phenomena, introducing formal approaches and the semantic metalanguage. Students will be provided with a small set of formal tools for the analysis of linguistic meaning. Students will learn to use these tools to probe into the nature of meaning in natural language and into different types of semantic phenomena. Specific topics that will be dealt with include predication, argumenthood, entailment, presupposition, definiteness and quantification.

      LL536 - English Language in the Media

      
      
       In this module, students develop a range of skills which will enable them to undertake the narratological and linguistic analysis of media texts (the term text is used broadly here, and will encompass both written and oral sources) taken from a number of sources, including newspapers, magazines and online discourses.  Areas covered include: genre theory, register, narrative theory, multimodality, dialogism and discourse analysis. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      SCL501 - Languages in the Classroom

      
      
       The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act to some extent in the role of a teaching assistant, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a language topic or talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly online journal. Some travel may be required by students taking this module.  In this instance, it should be noted that the University is unable to cover the cost of any such journey.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

       This module may only be taken provided that other Italian non-language units are being followed throughout the final year. The subject of the Essay will be agreed between the student and a supervisor appointed by the Section; it will normally arise from work done either in other Stage 2 and 3 modules or during the year abroad, but other topics are not necessarily excluded. It will be based on the students own research under the guidance of a supervisor.

      IT548 - Italian Cinema and Literature

      
      
       This module discusses contemporary film adaptations (1990s-2000s) taken from four different Italian textual sources (childrens tale, monologue, novel and non-fiction) under the following main aspects: 1.   as "parallel" works which supplement the original literary texts. Films expand, update and adjust the themes of the original literary texts to the historical, social and cultural context in which the adaptations are made. 2.   as works of literary criticism. The way the narrative of a film adaptation is structured and the way a film chooses to selectively focus on some particular episodes and themes is evidence of how the film director critically analyses the literary text and "re-writes" it in the form of a screenplay and in the editing of the material filmed;3.   as an altogether "new" product that structurally differs from the original literary source. Cinema's language relies on signifying images or visual signs that are irreducible to those of written and spoken languages;4.   finally, we will analyse the impact that filmmaking had on the art of writing, assessing the extent to which contemporary novels are often already written with the big screen in mind. We will focus on four emblematic contemporary adaptations: Collodis Pinocchio, adapted by Roberto Benigni, Bariccos Novecento (a monologue), adapted by Tornatore (La leggenda del pianist sulloceano), Ammanitis Io non ho paura, adapted by Gabriele Salvatores, and finally Savianos Gomorra, adapted by Matteo Garrone.

      IT564 - Istantanea: Photography and Visual Culture in Modern and Contemporary I

      
      
       This module aims at developing students visual literacy within the context of Italian studies, by teaching the skills necessary for the reading of static visual materials, especially photography. Contextually, it aims at developing and enhancing the critical response of students to such imagery, with particular focus on their social, cultural and political context. Photography worldwide has been at the centre of daily life, artistic production and political propaganda for the last century and a half. This holds all the more true for Italy, whose contemporary history as a unified country begins almost at the same time as the popularisation of photography. This module will explore this relationship on a socio-historical basis: It will analyse, among other topics, the portrayal of the Risorgimento; Lombrosos criminological and anthropometric use of photography; pseudo-anthropological photography in colonialist exploits, racism and eugenics; Fascist propaganda; futurism and modernism; neo-realist documentary photography and its influence on photojournalism of the 1960s-70s; the paparazzi, fashion and advertisement; photography and the contemporary visual arts; digital photography and social networks. By means of a close reading of photographic and other visual materials, the students will gain a profound understanding of the practicesideological, political, commercial, aesthetic, socialthat produce such materials within the modern Italian cultural context.

      IT571 - Learning Italian Through Literature

      
      
       Literature is an unrivalled tool to teach a language. As well as expanding language awareness, it provides authentic material, personal involvement, and cultural enrichment.This module, primarily designed for last year students at an advanced level, integrates language and literature in order to provide learners with a chance to perfect their mastery of the Italian language and practice a variety of language skills, while introducing them to some among the most representative texts of contemporary Italian fiction.The approach will be linguistic, thematic and intercultural. The chosen literary texts will be used in order to analyse the peculiar features of the Italian language as well as to encourage self-reflection, interaction, and cross-cultural confrontation. Texts to be dealt with include: Italo Calvinos Lavventura di un lettore, Leonardo Sciascias Il lungo viaggio, Dino Buzzatis Sette piani, Giuseppe Pontiggias Vitali Antonio, Dacia Marainis Il Bambino Grammofono e lUomo Piccione, Luigi Malerbas Le galline pensierose and Le pietre volanti (extracts), Andrea Camilleris Il giudice Surra.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      LL534 - Semantics and Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will introduce the students to the study of meaning at the levels of semantics and pragmatics. The discussed topics will range from the study of word meaning to the study of sentence meaning and utterance (contextualised) meaning. The module will introduce significant notions and theories for the field of semantics and pragmatics, such as theories of concepts, Truth Conditions, the Gricean theory of conversational implicatures, Speech Act theory, and Politeness theory. The students will have the opportunity to reflect upon real data and analyse the processes of conveying and understanding meaning at the semantics/pragmatics interface.

      LL533 - Topics in Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will focus on extending students critical understanding of pragmatic meaning. Central areas of linguistic pragmatics, such as conversational implicature, maxims of conversation, and principles of politeness and speech acts are outlined, discussed and evaluated critically. The module also explores controversies over the universality of the aforementioned theories, looking more closely at how human interaction is based on different cultural scripts and encouraging students to reflect upon and discuss the cultural influences which impact meaning in a range of intercultural communicative settings. Students will also have the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of pragmatic theories on the basis of empirical investigations, familiarising themselves with the related methodologies and tools of analysis.

      LL532 - Learning and Teaching Languages

      
      
       This module examines the principles on which contemporary second language teaching methods are founded. It will analyse first and second language acquisition theories in the light of current developments in language learning and teaching theories. Students will analyse a range of language teaching methods taking into account the ways in which they reflect acquisition theory.   The module will give students the opportunity to compare L2 teaching methods from the perspective of: form, function and meaning and student and teacher roles. This will allow students to evaluate the effectiveness of specific language teaching methods. Students will have the opportunity to discuss the ways in which context directly influences the choice and implementation of L2 teaching methods, and will be able to follow personal interests by investigating language teaching methods in context.  Although the focus is primarily on learning and teaching English, the language acquisition  theories and L2 teaching methods examined in this module may also apply to the teaching  and learning of any language.

      LL530 - Writing In The Media: A Practical Approach

      
      
       This module is aimed towards students who are considering a career in journalism, freelance writing, publishing and related fields, but will also be of great use to those with a general interest in the area of media and language studies. It enables students to put into practice theories and methods of discourse analysis by producing their own portfolio of journalism and media-related writing. The course functions as a useful and complementary sister module to LL510 Creative Writing: A Stylistic Approach, but can be taken independently. A consideration of the impact of new media (multimodality) on the field will form a substantial component of the modules content. Students will carry out their own research, for example using Canterbury and its environs as their news area, collecting information, arranging and carrying out relevant interviews, and writing up projects. They will produce and submit a portfolio of original journalism in which they demonstrate their ability to use the English language and to structure their writing with the target audience in mind. Accompanying this, students will submit a critical commentary in which they will reflect on how an understanding of relevant discourse, stylistic and narratological theory has impacted on their writing. The module will be structured along both theoretical and practical lines, with 2-hour workshops based on input, analysis and practice.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL525 - The Study of Speech

      
      
       This course is an introduction to the linguistic study of speech. It covers how speech sounds are produced and perceived and what their acoustic characteristics are (often referred to as phonetics), as well as how speech sounds are organized into sound systems cross-linguistically (often referred to as phonology). Emphasis will be placed on the sound system of English (including dialectal variation) but basics of sound systems across the worlds languages will also be briefly covered and contrasted with English. Finally, the course will cover the differences between the traditional static view of speech sounds as articulatory postures and the organization of running speech, together with the repercussions that our current knowledge about running speech has for our understanding of phonological systems, their organization and formal representation.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL524 - History of British English

      
      
       The module will begin with a consideration of what the term English means, and of what other, potentially rival, languages have been spoken in the British Isles. It will then consider how successive waves of conquest shaped the sociolinguistic situation to one of di- or triglossia, with English one of a number of varieties used in a restricted set of socially determined domains. Using Haugens standardization model, we will examine the factors which led first to selection and later acceptance of English as the dominant variety, and consider the associated linguistic processes of codification and elaboration of function. Working with short texts from different time periods, the module will then show how and why grammatical changes occurred in Anglo-Saxon, Old and Middle English (e.g. loss of case marking, gender, weakening of the verbal paradigm) and their consequences for the modern language. We will also consider phonological changes (e.g. the Great English Vowel Shift) and their consequences for dialect differentiation. We will conclude by exploring ongoing change in contemporary English (notably koineization in major cities), and the likely consequences for future English in the British Isles.

      LL522 - Morphology

      
      
       This course is an introduction to morphology and to the practice of morphological analysis. By focusing on a range of phenomena, including those falling under inflection, derivation, and compounding (both in English and in other languages), the course helps students develop tools for pattern observation in data, description and analysis of word structure, and hypothesis testing. Students will also gain an understanding of the role of morphology in the grammar and how it relates to other components, such as phonology, syntax and semantics.

      LL519 - Syntax 1

      
      
       This course will introduce students to one aspect of formal linguistics, specifically syntactic theory. Syntax will be defined as one aspect of a persons grammar, to be distinguished from the lexicon, semantics, morphology, and phonology. Focusing on the structure of sentences, the course will examine the principles according to which phrases and structures are formed, as well as speakers knowledge about the structural well-formedness of the sentences they hear and produce. Students will gradually learn to draw syntactic trees that can represent the syntactic operations that they will be introduced to. They will learn to conduct syntactic tests on English and cross-linguistic data, thereby becoming versed with the empirical method. The course will combine both minimalist and earlier government and binding work. We will examine the competence/performance distinction, the notion of I-language, poverty of the stimulus arguments, levels of representation, phrase-structure rules, constituency tests as a means for testing phrase structure, case theory, theta theory, binding and movement.

      LL518 - Stylistics: Language in Literature

      
      
       This module is concerned with the stylistic analysis of literature and is based on the premise that the decision to study literature is also a decision to study the expressive mechanics of language (and vice versa). Attention is given to all three main genres (poetry, prose fiction and drama); thus the module is divided into three blocks according to the kind of text analysed. The first section examines poetry and considers topics such as patterns of lexis, phonetic and metrical organisation and the relationship to meaning; the second looks at fiction through patterns of style variation, inferencing and speech thought presentation; the third examines drama and considers topics such as the patterns in turn-taking and their relationship to the roles and functions of characters, speech act analysis and styles of politeness behaviour. At all stages of the module, the social and cultural context of the works studies will be an important consideration. Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL513 - Language Variation and Change

      
      
       Weeks 1-4 will explore the reasons for the initial exclusion of extralinguistic (ie. social) data from linguistic theory, and the limitations of traditional dialectology, before exploring some early variationist studies by Trudgill (Norwich) and Labov (Marthas Vineyard; New York) and examining their theoretical bases. Weeks 6-7 will examine the advances brought about by network studies (e.g. Lesley Milroy in Belfast), and the extent to which they offer a challenge to traditional assumptions in sociolinguistic methodology, an issue to which we return in week 8, which critically evaluates the so-called sociolinguistic gender pattern. Weeks 10-12 focus more specifically on issues of change, looking initially at neogrammarian theories and then the claims of Trudgill, James Milroy and others that certain kinds of change are predictable in specific types of social arrangement.

      PL576 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

Relevant theoretical work in the fields of psycholinguistics and language processing is outlined and discussed. And students will evaluate the efficacy of these theories on the basis of experimental investigations which they themselves will construct and conduct, for example word association experiments, lexicon decision tasks and parsing phenomena.

      LL599 - Dissertation

      
      
       This module enables students to research in depth a linguistic topic. The dissertation topic may be chosen from a list provided by the supervisor, or selected by the student under guidance from the supervisor in an area reflecting the students interests and the supervisors research programme, interests and expertise. The topic will normally build upon a module that the student has undertaken in their second year. In this instance, the student must have gained a minimum of 65% on that module. In the rare case that the chosen topic builds upon an Autumn-term module in the students third year, acceptance is at the supervisors discretion; it is expected that the supervisor will be the convenor of that module and can reach a decision on the basis of their assessment of the students potential and the viability of the project. Topics available for study are subject to the availability of an appropriate supervisor. In order to ensure adequate supervision, supervisors may not accept to supervise more than 3 dissertations in a given year.With guidance from their supervisors, students will identify a research question and apply appropriate methodologies to data collection and their analysis. While the supervisor will be there to guide students, students will take responsibility for setting their own deadlines, working at a pace that suits them, with the aim of submitting a dissertation of 10,000 words early in the Summer term.

      LL538 - First Language Acquisition

      
      
       This course will start by examining the topic of language acquisition, demarcating the domains for linguistic inquiry. It will challenge everyday assumptions about the way in which children acquire language and introduce key theoretical issues, always assessing the validity of each theory on the basis of empirical evidence. The course will examine the biological basis of language and its localisation and lateralisation, using evidence from both typical and atypical populations. It will evaluate the role of input in language acquisition and the extent to which this facilitates linguistic development. All these issues will be set against an understanding of the normal stages of language acquisition, essentially mapping out the linguistic milestones reached by typically developing children to the age of four. An understanding of the interaction between the components involved (phonology, morphology, semantics, rudimentary structure, pragmatics) will provide the empirical backdrop to assess the efficacy of theoretical models introduced. The course will end, having laid the foundations for students to undertake a higher level of research in this area.

Here, the focus is on semiotics as applied in the linguistic analysis of a wide range of media discourse types, but with particular emphasis on advertising. Areas covered include: semiotics, the work of Saussure, the British press, multimodality, the new media and social networking.. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will further develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the acute importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval
