 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CL329 - Introduction to Archaeology

      
      
       The module will introduce archaeology as an academic discipline, providing grounding in basic concepts and methodology and techniques of analysis relating to archaeological evidence. It will provide background relevant to other archaeological and historical modules through examining aspects of the archaeological process in prehistoric, Roman and medieval contexts. It will enable students to make an informed choice of subsequent modules. Topics will include basic fieldwork methods and techniques, and an introduction to key topics in interpretation, such as society and culture, ritual and religion, technology, etc. through case studies e.g . of Pompeii, Sutton Hoo, and the Ice Man.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CL353 - The Civilisations of Greece and Rome

      
      
       In the Autumn term we start with Greece. The history will centre on Athens in the 5th century B.C. We begin with Solons reforms, then after considering the period of the Persian invasions we study the developed democracy with its empire under Pericles and its destruction in the Peloponnesian War. After 5 weeks, we move to the literature of the period, more specifically, the development of tragedy and comedy in fifth-century Athens, examining staging and dramatic conventions such as the role of actor, chorus and religious function and plot, especially the handling of mythological themes. We will analyse a selection of major plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Within this framework the module explores the role of tragedy and comedy as vehicles for public debate in the democracy, and its treatment of justice, religion, rationalism and patriotic themes.In the Spring term, we move to Rome. In the Roman part of the course we shall treat the last century of the republic. Our focus will be on how that republic fell and was replaced by the empire whose founder was Augustus. Among the themes examined will be political violence, the intrusion of the army into political life and the rise of the warlord. In the literature part of the Spring term the module is concerned with the patronage of the arts (poetry, history writing, art and architecture) under Augustus, with the role of the arts as propaganda, and the thesis that writers were recruited to act as spokesmen for the policies and ideals of the principate. The central theme is the creation of enduring images of Rome and Empire, using traditional historical and mythological materials; alongside this the module treats areas of public policy such as moral legislation, festivals, religious reform and the position of women.  The module is also concerned with the responses of the writers, whether as supporters of public policy, or as commenting on and reacting against it. Thus, its content is much better understood as a result of the historical development outlined in the first part of term.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      GE329 - Intensive Beginners German

      
      
       This is a core module for students who study German to degree level but did not study it in secondary school. This module is very intensive as it brings students to the same level as those who have studied to A-Level. It may be taken as a wild module, with the understanding of the time commitment required. Students who cannot commit to the intensive nature of the module should take GE304 instead. Students are taught all skills from levels A1, A2 and B1 of the CEFR.  The students are taught basic and complex grammatical principles, use spoken German in everyday situations, do short compositions, and are introduced to German culture. Students are highly motivated and expected to progress rapidly from beginners' level to core competence in the areas outlined above, so that they may progress to the next level GE516 Learning German 3 (for stage 2 students) with confidence.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      GE331 - Learning German 2 (Post-GCSE German)

      
      
       This module is a practical one, concentrating on listening, reading, speaking and writing in German, but also introducing students to the richness and diversity of German-language culture. It is intended as the first-year core language module for German degree students who have a GCSE qualification or equivalent in the language.  Students are taught all skills from levels A2 and B1 of the CEFR, including all basic and some complex grammatical principles. They learn to use spoken German in everyday situations, to conduct discussions on topics of contemporary relevance and to write short compositions in German. Students are expected to progress rapidly from GCSE level to core competence in the areas outlined above, so that they may progress to the next level GE516 Learning German 3 (for stage 2 students) with confidence.

      GE332 - German Applied Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition

      
      
       This module is intended for students who start(ed) to learn German at University. It supports the acquisition of German as a foreign language as an adult; the module should be taken together with a language module (e.g. GE329). In the form of a learner diary the students document and critically reflect their progress in learning German. The level of knowledge of German required increases during the duration of the module, in line with the proficiency increase to be expected from a beginner's language module. The module notably has a highly applied focus. For example, students will be familiarized with grammatical terms (types of words, parts of speech) and structures (morphology, sentence structure), learn how to effectively acquire vocabulary, improve their pronunciation etc. The modules topics (directly or indirectly) address all four language skills as well as grammar and vocabulary.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      GE311 - Varieties of German Writing

      
      
       This introduction to the modern period in German literature covers a variety of representative authors and works including lyric poetry, drama, the novella and short story. Texts are selected for their relevance, not only to the development of varieties of German writing, but also to the social and political development of the German-speaking territories during these seminal years. Literary movements discussed include the Sturm und Drang, Romanticism, Naturalism, Expressionism and political engagement in the interwar period. Political and social currents include the repression of free speech during the Vorm&auml;rz, German Nationalism in the late nineteenth century, the Unification of Germany, the First World War and the rise of National Socialism.

      GE312 - Images of Germany, 1945-1990

      
      
       German cultural production since 1945 had been largely dominated by ideologies and politics, by the forced forty-year division into two republics in opposite camps in the Cold War, and by the legacy of National Socialism, which factors all contributed to the eruption of student unrest in the 1960s. The material studied on the module covers the problems of returning soldiers in 1945 and the hardships endured by the civilian population; the trauma of the Holocaust; the pioneering idealism in the foundational phase in the German Democratic Republic and a satirical take on that; the pain caused to ordinary individuals by the erection of the Berlin Wall; the significance of the Vietnam War to the Left in the 1960s and the turn to violence in the pursuit of political goals in the following decade; and concludes with a collection of post-unification short stories with little political import.

      GE328 - Post-1989 German Cinema

      
      
       The fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 led to fundamental cultural and political re-alignments in German-speaking countries, unleashing a wave of cultural comment and creative activity. The 1990s and early twenty-first century saw a revitalisation of the film scene in both Germany and Austria, evident not only in highly acclaimed niche productions but also in a series of international box-office hits. This module will explore the themes and styles of post-Wende German-language cinema, focusing on representations of the GDR past and the phenomenon of Ostalgie; multiculturalism and migration; the transformation of Berlin and Vienna post-1989; and the documentary turn in German and Austrian film since 2000.The films selected for study can also be made available with English subtitles.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL652 - Gods, Heroes and Mystery Cults: Religion in  Ancient Greece

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL659 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world? This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

      CL663 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences. Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject. Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness. In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject. An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus. The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine. From here, the study will move into the Roman period. Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry. For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen. Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another. Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.

      CL665 - Constantinople and the Late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL666 - Foundations of Britain

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL677 - Fieldwork Practice

      
      
       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL685 - Torture and Sacrifice: the literature of early Christianity

      
      
       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity.  A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

      CL692 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

      CL700 - Museum Studies (with internship)

      
      
       The module will allow the student to acquire knowledge and critical understanding of the fundamental principles related to collecting and interpreting objects within museums and managing these institutions. .Students will be required to become familiar and engage critically, during the seminars, with the key references on these topics. Students will then be required to apply concepts and principles learnt in class in the context of their internship.. As part of their internship, each student will devise a special project in consultation with the mentor and the module convenor. Precise objectives and skills to be learnt will be recorded and tracked regularly. Students will keep a weekly log of their activities. The placement may take place either as a block during the Easter vacation of Stage 2 or 3, or at regular intervals over the Autumn and Spring terms.

      CL708 - Greek Philosophy: Plato and Aristotle

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to some of the major works in ancient Greek philosophy in relation to ethics, aesthetics, political theory, ontology and metaphysics. Students will study substantial portions of primary texts by the Pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle. The emphasis throughout will be on the philosophical significance of the ideas studied. The module will concentrate on understanding key philosophical arguments and concepts within the context of the ancient Greek intellectual tradition. This means that students will gain a critical distance from normative and modern definitions of philosophical terms in order to understand how Greek philosophy generally approached questions and problems with different suppositions and conceptions of reality, reason and the purpose of human existence.

      CL310 - Greek for Beginners

      
      
       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

      CL713 - Athenian Power Plays

      
      
       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      GE578 - Women's Writing in German

      
      
       This module studies texts written by women in the late 18th and long 19th century up to 1918, the period during which female literacy gradually spread to all levels of the German-speaking population. It begins with an overview of the critical theory on gender and womens writing, and also covers the rise of the womens movement in German-speaking countries. Individual authors will be studied from the Age of Goethe onward, although particular attention is paid to the period 1860-1918, during which state structures in Germany, Austria and Switzerland gradually took over education provision for girls. Topics covered include: womens struggle for political and social emancipation; women in the world of work; issues of female solidarity versus class distinction; changing attitudes and representations of the family and womens role in the family; aesthetic strategies of political and social protest literature.

       The module will trace the emergence of the short prose narrative around 1800 and examine its adaptation during the nineteenth century, when realism asserted itself and became the subject of critical controversy. The module will look at the major writers of the period to see what scope the development of realism offered them for artistic variation and psychological depth. Their works will be studied as reflections of the societies and regions to which they belonged and as indications of the profound political and economic changes occurring during the period. This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

       This module will examine the media systems of the contemporary German-speaking world, including both public and private structures and spanning print, broadcasting and digital media. In particular, it will trace the medias contribution to the creation and development of the public sphere in German-speaking countries, and the relationship between the media and its producers. Attention will also be paid throughout to the European and global dimension of todays media politics and culture. In the first half of the module, students will be given a systematic overview of the German-language media and media concentration (interdependence between media and market, public and private).

In the second half of the module, students will be instructed in media analysis and the practical skills of drafting press releases, reviews and news articles in German. Topics that are currently in the news in German-speaking countries will be chosen in consultation with the seminar leader and followed across the various media in which they are reported (Pressespiegel). Students will apply the theoretical knowledge gained from the initial phase of the module to assess these samples in a critical essay. They will also produce a portfolio of shorter texts and/or recordings on current affairs and cultural topics. They will be encouraged as part of this portfolio to become active in on-line news forums in German. Depending on availability and resources, the second half of the module will include a workshop session with German-language media professionals. Contacts will be forged that will lead to the possibility of work experience in the media in German-speaking countries for students who have completed the module.The module will be taught and assessed entirely in German.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      GE589 - Wien-Berlin: Tales of Two Cities

      
      
       This module focuses on the recent history of Vienna and Berlin, the cultural capitals of the German-speaking world. Many of the key events and movements that influenced Europe over the past century are intimately linked to these two cities, from the collapse of the Habsburg Empire, the development of extremist left- and right-wing parties in the interwar period to the division and re-uniting of Europe as embodied by the Berlin Wall.   Changes and continuities in the political, social and physical topography of Vienna and Berlin will be traced by studying representations of both cities in a range of texts and films from the early twentieth to the early twenty-first century. Alongside feature films and prose genres such as short stories and reportage, the module will also consider theoretical texts on the city and the contribution of urban life to modern German-language culture. Central themes are the interplay of individual and collective, urban anonymity and liberation versus alienation and uniformity, multiculturalism and migration.

      GE591 - German Expressionism 1910-1925

      
      
       This module explores one of the major contributions of Germanic culture to modernism. Straddling the period immediately before, during, and after the First World War, Expressionism emerged as a reaction against the mechanizing forces of modern industrial society, seeking nothing less than a renewal of mankind. With compelling intensity, the Expressionists developed an immediately recognizable style that found an audience across Europe. This module looks at works from a range of genres: from poetry to drama, from prose (both fiction and manifestos) to painting, Expressionism was a key strand of international modernism across the Arts, embracing figures as diverse as Georg Kaiser, Kurt Pinthus, Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, Franz Kafka, and Oskar Kokoschka. A century later, it remains one of the most important  and most idiosyncratically Germanic  of all modern artistic movements.

      CL590 - The Foundations of Britain: Archaeology of the first Millenium B.C.

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world?  This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL639 - Constantinople and the late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL607 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences.  Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject.  Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness.  In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject.  An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus.  The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine.  From here, the study will move into the Roman period.  Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry.  For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen.  Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another.  Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      GE592 - German Expressionism 1910 - 1925

      
      
       This module explores one of the major contributions of Germanic culture to modernism. Straddling the period immediately before, during, and after the First World War, Expressionism emerged as a reaction against the mechanizing forces of modern industrial society, seeking nothing less than a renewal of mankind. With compelling intensity, the Expressionists developed an immediately recognizable style that found an audience across Europe. This module looks at works from a range of genres: from poetry to drama, from prose (both fiction and manifestos) to painting, Expressionism was a key strand of international modernism across the Arts, embracing figures as diverse as Georg Kaiser, Kurt Pinthus, Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, Franz Kafka, and Oskar Kokoschka. A century later, it remains one of the most important  and most idiosyncratically Germanic  of all modern artistic movements.

      GE590 - Wien-Berlin. Tales of Two Cities

      
      
       This module focuses on the recent history of Vienna and Berlin, the cultural capitals of the German-speaking world. Many of the key events and movements that influenced Europe over the past century are intimately linked to these two cities, from the collapse of the Habsburg Empire, the development of extremist left- and right-wing parties in the interwar period to the division and re-uniting of Europe as embodied by the Berlin Wall. Changes and continuities in the political, social and physical topography of Vienna and Berlin will be traced by studying representations of both cities in a range of texts and films from the early twentieth to the early twenty-first century. Alongside feature films and prose genres such as short stories and reportage, the module will also consider theoretical texts on the city and the contribution of urban life to modern German-language culture. Central themes are the interplay of individual and collective, urban anonymity and liberation versus alienation and uniformity, multiculturalism and migration.

      GE586 - Medien und &Ouml;ffentlichkeit

      
      
       This module will examine the media systems of the contemporary German-speaking world, including both public and private structures and spanning print, broadcasting and digital media. In particular, it will trace the medias contribution to the creation and development of the public sphere in German-speaking countries, and the relationship between the media and its producers. Attention will also be paid throughout to the European and global dimension of todays media politics and culture. In the first half of the module, students will be given a systematic overview of the German-language media and media concentration (interdependence between media and market, public and private). Theories of journalism and public communication will be introduced and critically evaluated within the context of the rapid changes and shifts in structure which currently characterise the media landscape in German-speaking countries. In the second half of the module, students will be instructed in media analysis and the practical skills of drafting press releases, reviews and news articles in German. Topics that are currently in the news in German-speaking countries will be chosen in consultation with the seminar leader and followed across the various media in which they are reported (Pressespiegel). Students will apply the theoretical knowledge gained from the initial phase of the module to assess these samples in a critical essay. They will also produce a portfolio of shorter texts and/or recordings on current affairs and cultural topics. They will be encouraged as part of this portfolio to become active in on-line news forums in German. Depending on availability and resources, the second half of the module will include a workshop session with German-language media professionals. Contacts will be forged that will lead to the possibility of work experience in the media in German-speaking countries for students who have completed the module.The module will be taught and assessed entirely in German.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

       This module introduces students to the forms and varieties of modern written German through engagement with a wide variety of print and digital media. It explores the similarities and differences between different dimensions of German as it is used today, for example in the media, in teaching and in business. Students taking this module will examine the rhetorical patterns underlying all of these forms of communication, and will thereby improve their own language skills. Emphasis is placed on using a variety of resources (news media, websites, blogs) to build up a thorough awareness of the modern German language in context, and on encouraging students to work together in using up-to-date resources in producing German texts. In particular, the module aims to prepare students for their graduate life and for the uses of written German that will be expected of them on work placements, in their graduate jobs and in the German public sphere.

       The module will trace the emergence of the short prose narrative around 1800 and examine its adaptation during the nineteenth century, when realism asserted itself and became the subject of critical controversy. The module will look at the major writers of the period to see what scope the development of realism offered them for artistic variation and psychological depth. Their works will be studied as reflections of the societies and regions to which they belonged and as indications of the profound political and economic changes occurring during the period.
