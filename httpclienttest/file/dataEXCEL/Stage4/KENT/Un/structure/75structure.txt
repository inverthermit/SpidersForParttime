Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      LL310 - Foundations of Language 1: Sounds and Words

      
      
       The module will begin by offering a basic introduction to the description of speech sounds, with emphasis on those used in English and detailed descriptions first of consonants, and then of vowels. The gaps between sound and orthography will be highlighted as the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbols are learned. The course will then move from phonetics (the study of speech sounds) to phonology (the study of the sound systems in language), focusing on the phonotactics (rules of co-occurrence) and general phonological rules of English. Students will use this knowledge to explore and describe different accents of English. From phonology, the module moves to morphology (the study of word-structure), highlighting the differences between derivational and inflectional morphology, and introducing analytical concepts such as the morpheme and allomorphy, and critically evaluating descriptive models such as word and paradigm, item-and-process and item-and-arrangement grammars. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LL311 - Foundations of Language 2: Structure and Meaning

      
      
       This module introduces linguistic approaches to the study of language structure, language meaning and communication. For language structure, the module provides an overview of the major grammatical properties of English (e.g. lexical classes, grammatical functions, phrase and sentence structure), and provides students with analytical tools for understanding and constructing arguments about linguistic structure (e.g. morpho-syntactic tests, constituency tests).  For meaning, the module introduces students to lexical semantics (the meanings of words and characteristics of word classes) and sentential semantics (how the meanings of words and phrases combine to create propositional meaning). In addition, the module covers introductory topics in pragmatics, focusing on context dependence and the differences between semantic and pragmatic meaning. . The relationships among related but distinct notions such as grammar, inference, and communication are discussed throughout. The module is particularly useful for students who are studying linguistics, psychology, anthropology, language(s), or literature, as it provides them with analytical skills for understanding language and language-related behaviourThis module introduces linguistic approaches to the study of language structure, language meaning and communication.

      PL302 - Introduction to Philosophy: Knowledge and Metaphysics

      
      
       Can I know that I am not dreaming? Am I the same person I was when I was ten years old? Do I have an immaterial mind or immortal soul? Am I a mere machine or do I have a free will? What are the fundamental properties of the world? Does God exist? This module is meant to be an introduction to these and other fundamental problems of philosophy. The module begins with an examination of some themes in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, and moves on to discuss the arguments of other classical philosophers, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and also of contemporary thinkers. Among the themes addressed are: the nature of knowledge, scepticism, personal identity, the mind-body problem, free will and determinism, primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, God.

      PL303 - Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics

      
      
       Students studying on this module will be introduced to a number of big questions in ethics. The questions may include the following: What makes a life good? Is it happiness? Or is it something else? Another big question is: What makes actions right or wrong? Is it God demanding or forbidding them? Or are actions perhaps right to the extent that they serve to make lives better off, and wrong to the extent that they make lives worse off? Some philosophers have thought so. Others wonder: What if I steal money from someone so rich that my act in no way makes her life go any worse. Might it still be the case that I have acted wronglyeven if I haven't made anyone worse off? A third bit question is this: Whats the status of morality? Is it, for example, the case that whats right for me might be wrong for you? Does it make any sense at all to talk about moral claims being true or false, even relative to moral communities? Might moral judgments be nothing but expressions of sentiments? Throughout the course, students will be examining these and similar questions from the point of view of a variety of philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume.

      PL310 - Introduction to Philosopy: Logic and Reasoning

      
      
       Since Platos Dialogues, it has been part of philosophical enquiry to consider philosophical questions using logic and common sense alone.  This module aims to train students to continue in that tradition.  In the first part students will be introduced to basic themes in introductory logic and critical thinking.  In the second part students will be presented with a problem each week in the form of a short argument, question, or philosophical puzzle and will be asked to think about it without consulting the literature.  The problem, and students responses to it, will then form the basis of a structured discussion.  By the end of the module, students (a) will have acquired a basic logical vocabulary and techniques for the evaluation of arguments; (b) will have practised applying these techniques to selected philosophical topics; and (c) will have acquired the ability to look at new claims or problems and to apply their newly acquired argumentative and critical skills in order to generate philosophical discussions of them.It will be taught through a combination of lectures and seminars in the first half of the term, and seminars only in the second half of the term.

      PL315 - Philosophical Reading and Writing (core)

      
      
       What do philosophers do?  How do they think?  What do they typically think about?  How do philosophers write?  What sorts of writing are acceptable in philosophy?  How should you write?  How should philosophy best be read in order to be understood and assessed? In this module we will introduce you to some of the most interesting questions in philosophy, both from its history and from current debates.  As we do this we will show you how to think, read and write as a philosopher.   Some of the questions we will discuss this year include: Why is Humes fork so important in the history of philosophy?, What is the difference between evaluative and descriptive judgements in aesthetics? and What is the difference between is and ought?  We will also think about questions of more general philosophical import, such as: What it is to presuppose something?, What is it to argue in a vicious circle?, and What does a philosophical definition look like?

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      LL537 - English Language in the Media 2

      
      
       In this module, students continue to develop and explore the themes introduced in LL536 English Language in the Media 1. Here, the focus is on semiotics as applied in the linguistic analysis of a wide range of media discourse types, but with particular emphasis on advertising. Areas covered include: semiotics, the work of Saussure, the British press, multimodality, the new media and social networking.. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will further develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the acute importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL538 - First Language Acquisition

      
      
       This course will start by examining the topic of language acquisition, demarcating the domains for linguistic inquiry. It will challenge everyday assumptions about the way in which children acquire language and introduce key theoretical issues, always assessing the validity of each theory on the basis of empirical evidence. The course will examine the biological basis of language and its localisation and lateralisation, using evidence from both typical and atypical populations. It will evaluate the role of input in language acquisition and the extent to which this facilitates linguistic development. All these issues will be set against an understanding of the normal stages of language acquisition, essentially mapping out the linguistic milestones reached by typically developing children to the age of four. An understanding of the interaction between the components involved (phonology, morphology, semantics, rudimentary structure, pragmatics) will provide the empirical backdrop to assess the efficacy of theoretical models introduced. The course will end, having laid the foundations for students to undertake a higher level of research in this area.

      LL539 - English Language Teaching 1

      
      
       This module is useful for anyone who may be considering teaching languages to second language/foreign language learners in the future, with particular emphasis on English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), although it provides a rich variety of transferable skills for any participant. It raises awareness of the English language, introduces lesson planning, classroom organisation, language teaching and feedback. There will be an opportunity to observe ESOL teaching and plan and prepare a lesson. Guidance will be given on writing a lesson plan, using resources and creating materials for foreign language learners The emphasis is on building strategies and techniques for foreign language teaching and understanding what makes good practice.

      PL602 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      LL512 - Language Processing

      
      
       This course will focus on the structure of lexical items, the way in which these different lexical items are stored and the nature of the relation between them. Relevant theoretical work in the fields of psycholinguistics and language processing is outlined and discussed. And students will evaluate the efficacy of these theories on the basis of experimental investigations which they themselves will construct and conduct, for example word association experiments, lexicon decision tasks and parsing phenomena.

      LL513 - Language Variation and Change

      
      
       Weeks 1-4 will explore the reasons for the initial exclusion of extralinguistic (ie. social) data from linguistic theory, and the limitations of traditional dialectology, before exploring some early variationist studies by Trudgill (Norwich) and Labov (Marthas Vineyard; New York) and examining their theoretical bases. Weeks 6-7 will examine the advances brought about by network studies (e.g. Lesley Milroy in Belfast), and the extent to which they offer a challenge to traditional assumptions in sociolinguistic methodology, an issue to which we return in week 8, which critically evaluates the so-called sociolinguistic gender pattern. Weeks 10-12 focus more specifically on issues of change, looking initially at neogrammarian theories and then the claims of Trudgill, James Milroy and others that certain kinds of change are predictable in specific types of social arrangement.

      LL518 - Stylistics: Language in Literature

      
      
       This module is concerned with the stylistic analysis of literature and is based on the premise that the decision to study literature is also a decision to study the expressive mechanics of language (and vice versa). Attention is given to all three main genres (poetry, prose fiction and drama); thus the module is divided into three blocks according to the kind of text analysed. The first section examines poetry and considers topics such as patterns of lexis, phonetic and metrical organisation and the relationship to meaning; the second looks at fiction through patterns of style variation, inferencing and speech thought presentation; the third examines drama and considers topics such as the patterns in turn-taking and their relationship to the roles and functions of characters, speech act analysis and styles of politeness behaviour. At all stages of the module, the social and cultural context of the works studies will be an important consideration. Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL519 - Syntax 1

      
      
       This course will introduce students to one aspect of formal linguistics, specifically syntactic theory. Syntax will be defined as one aspect of a persons grammar, to be distinguished from the lexicon, semantics, morphology, and phonology. Focusing on the structure of sentences, the course will examine the principles according to which phrases and structures are formed, as well as speakers knowledge about the structural well-formedness of the sentences they hear and produce. Students will gradually learn to draw syntactic trees that can represent the syntactic operations that they will be introduced to. They will learn to conduct syntactic tests on English and cross-linguistic data, thereby becoming versed with the empirical method. The course will combine both minimalist and earlier government and binding work. We will examine the competence/performance distinction, the notion of I-language, poverty of the stimulus arguments, levels of representation, phrase-structure rules, constituency tests as a means for testing phrase structure, case theory, theta theory, binding and movement.

      LL522 - Morphology

      
      
       This course is an introduction to morphology and to the practice of morphological analysis. By focusing on a range of phenomena, including those falling under inflection, derivation, and compounding (both in English and in other languages), the course helps students develop tools for pattern observation in data, description and analysis of word structure, and hypothesis testing. Students will also gain an understanding of the role of morphology in the grammar and how it relates to other components, such as phonology, syntax and semantics.

      LL524 - History of British English

      
      
       The module will begin with a consideration of what the term English means, and of what other, potentially rival, languages have been spoken in the British Isles. It will then consider how successive waves of conquest shaped the sociolinguistic situation to one of di- or triglossia, with English one of a number of varieties used in a restricted set of socially determined domains. Using Haugens standardization model, we will examine the factors which led first to selection and later acceptance of English as the dominant variety, and consider the associated linguistic processes of codification and elaboration of function. Working with short texts from different time periods, the module will then show how and why grammatical changes occurred in Anglo-Saxon, Old and Middle English (e.g. loss of case marking, gender, weakening of the verbal paradigm) and their consequences for the modern language. We will also consider phonological changes (e.g. the Great English Vowel Shift) and their consequences for dialect differentiation. We will conclude by exploring ongoing change in contemporary English (notably koineization in major cities), and the likely consequences for future English in the British Isles.

      LL525 - The Study of Speech

      
      
       This course is an introduction to the linguistic study of speech. It covers how speech sounds are produced and perceived and what their acoustic characteristics are (often referred to as phonetics), as well as how speech sounds are organized into sound systems cross-linguistically (often referred to as phonology). Emphasis will be placed on the sound system of English (including dialectal variation) but basics of sound systems across the worlds languages will also be briefly covered and contrasted with English. Finally, the course will cover the differences between the traditional static view of speech sounds as articulatory postures and the organization of running speech, together with the repercussions that our current knowledge about running speech has for our understanding of phonological systems, their organization and formal representation.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL530 - Writing In The Media: A Practical Approach

      
      
       This module is aimed towards students who are considering a career in journalism, freelance writing, publishing and related fields, but will also be of great use to those with a general interest in the area of media and language studies. It enables students to put into practice theories and methods of discourse analysis by producing their own portfolio of journalism and media-related writing. The course functions as a useful and complementary sister module to LL510 Creative Writing: A Stylistic Approach, but can be taken independently. A consideration of the impact of new media (multimodality) on the field will form a substantial component of the modules content. Students will carry out their own research, for example using Canterbury and its environs as their news area, collecting information, arranging and carrying out relevant interviews, and writing up projects. They will produce and submit a portfolio of original journalism in which they demonstrate their ability to use the English language and to structure their writing with the target audience in mind. Accompanying this, students will submit a critical commentary in which they will reflect on how an understanding of relevant discourse, stylistic and narratological theory has impacted on their writing. The module will be structured along both theoretical and practical lines, with 2-hour workshops based on input, analysis and practice.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL532 - Learning and Teaching Languages

      
      
       This module examines the principles on which contemporary second language teaching methods are founded. It will analyse first and second language acquisition theories in the light of current developments in language learning and teaching theories. Students will analyse a range of language teaching methods taking into account the ways in which they reflect acquisition theory.   The module will give students the opportunity to compare L2 teaching methods from the perspective of: form, function and meaning and student and teacher roles. This will allow students to evaluate the effectiveness of specific language teaching methods. Students will have the opportunity to discuss the ways in which context directly influences the choice and implementation of L2 teaching methods, and will be able to follow personal interests by investigating language teaching methods in context.  Although the focus is primarily on learning and teaching English, the language acquisition  theories and L2 teaching methods examined in this module may also apply to the teaching  and learning of any language.

      LL533 - Topics in Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will focus on extending students critical understanding of pragmatic meaning. Central areas of linguistic pragmatics, such as conversational implicature, maxims of conversation, and principles of politeness and speech acts are outlined, discussed and evaluated critically. The module also explores controversies over the universality of the aforementioned theories, looking more closely at how human interaction is based on different cultural scripts and encouraging students to reflect upon and discuss the cultural influences which impact meaning in a range of intercultural communicative settings. Students will also have the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of pragmatic theories on the basis of empirical investigations, familiarising themselves with the related methodologies and tools of analysis.

       This module will introduce the students to the study of meaning at the levels of semantics and pragmatics. The discussed topics will range from the study of word meaning to the study of sentence meaning and utterance (contextualised) meaning. The module will introduce significant notions and theories for the field of semantics and pragmatics, such as theories of concepts, Truth Conditions, the Gricean theory of conversational implicatures, Speech Act theory, and Politeness theory. The students will have the opportunity to reflect upon real data and analyse the processes of conveying and understanding meaning at the semantics/pragmatics interface.

      LL535 - Topics in Semantics

      
      
       This course builds on the student's knowledge of semantic phenomena, introducing formal approaches and the semantic metalanguage. Students will be provided with a small set of formal tools for the analysis of linguistic meaning. Students will learn to use these tools to probe into the nature of meaning in natural language and into different types of semantic phenomena. Specific topics that will be dealt with include predication, argumenthood, entailment, presupposition, definiteness and quantification.

       In this module, students develop a range of skills which will enable them to undertake the narratological and linguistic analysis of media texts (the term text is used broadly here, and will encompass both written and oral sources) taken from a number of sources, including newspapers, magazines and online discourses.  Areas covered include: genre theory, register, narrative theory, multimodality, dialogism and discourse analysis. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      PL625 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      PL640 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL628 - Continental Philosophy: Subject, Identity and the Political

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to introduce students to some of the key arguments and debates in contemporary continental political philosophy through the focussed reading and discussion of the works of a number of central thinkers (Charles Taylor, Iris Marion Young, Foucualt, Derrida, Butler) in this field. It is also the aim of this module to consider the works and ideas of philosophers that are often overlooked on undergraduate political philosophy courses e.g. feminist thinkers and Queer theorists.The curriculum should not be regarded as written in stone but responsive to new publications and developments in this field of research and to events in the wider world.

      PL638 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations.   They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology.  Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel.  However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes.  In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist.  An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students.  However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand.  This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight.    The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers.  Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full.  These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval.The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

       What is art?  What is an artwork?  Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common?  If so, what are they?  Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided?  Do avant-garde works count as art?  Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention?  What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally?  These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course.  After that we will consider other issues and questions.  What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities?  What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way?  Why is rock music such a part of our lives?  Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery?  What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art?  Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters?  Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code?  And what on earth is the point of public art?  What is public art?

      PL584 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL585 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL596 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses.

      LL536 - English Language in the Media

      
      
       In this module, students develop a range of skills which will enable them to undertake the narratological and linguistic analysis of media texts (the term text is used broadly here, and will encompass both written and oral sources) taken from a number of sources, including newspapers, magazines and online discourses.  Areas covered include: genre theory, register, narrative theory, multimodality, dialogism and discourse analysis. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL535 - Topics in Semantics

      
      
       This course builds on the student's knowledge of semantic phenomena, introducing formal approaches and the semantic metalanguage. Students will be provided with a small set of formal tools for the analysis of linguistic meaning. Students will learn to use these tools to probe into the nature of meaning in natural language and into different types of semantic phenomena. Specific topics that will be dealt with include predication, argumenthood, entailment, presupposition, definiteness and quantification.

      LL534 - Semantics and Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will introduce the students to the study of meaning at the levels of semantics and pragmatics. The discussed topics will range from the study of word meaning to the study of sentence meaning and utterance (contextualised) meaning. The module will introduce significant notions and theories for the field of semantics and pragmatics, such as theories of concepts, Truth Conditions, the Gricean theory of conversational implicatures, Speech Act theory, and Politeness theory. The students will have the opportunity to reflect upon real data and analyse the processes of conveying and understanding meaning at the semantics/pragmatics interface.

      LL533 - Topics in Pragmatics

      
      
       This module will focus on extending students critical understanding of pragmatic meaning. Central areas of linguistic pragmatics, such as conversational implicature, maxims of conversation, and principles of politeness and speech acts are outlined, discussed and evaluated critically. The module also explores controversies over the universality of the aforementioned theories, looking more closely at how human interaction is based on different cultural scripts and encouraging students to reflect upon and discuss the cultural influences which impact meaning in a range of intercultural communicative settings. Students will also have the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of pragmatic theories on the basis of empirical investigations, familiarising themselves with the related methodologies and tools of analysis.

      LL532 - Learning and Teaching Languages

      
      
       This module examines the principles on which contemporary second language teaching methods are founded. It will analyse first and second language acquisition theories in the light of current developments in language learning and teaching theories. Students will analyse a range of language teaching methods taking into account the ways in which they reflect acquisition theory.   The module will give students the opportunity to compare L2 teaching methods from the perspective of: form, function and meaning and student and teacher roles. This will allow students to evaluate the effectiveness of specific language teaching methods. Students will have the opportunity to discuss the ways in which context directly influences the choice and implementation of L2 teaching methods, and will be able to follow personal interests by investigating language teaching methods in context.  Although the focus is primarily on learning and teaching English, the language acquisition  theories and L2 teaching methods examined in this module may also apply to the teaching  and learning of any language.

      LL530 - Writing In The Media: A Practical Approach

      
      
       This module is aimed towards students who are considering a career in journalism, freelance writing, publishing and related fields, but will also be of great use to those with a general interest in the area of media and language studies. It enables students to put into practice theories and methods of discourse analysis by producing their own portfolio of journalism and media-related writing. The course functions as a useful and complementary sister module to LL510 Creative Writing: A Stylistic Approach, but can be taken independently. A consideration of the impact of new media (multimodality) on the field will form a substantial component of the modules content. Students will carry out their own research, for example using Canterbury and its environs as their news area, collecting information, arranging and carrying out relevant interviews, and writing up projects. They will produce and submit a portfolio of original journalism in which they demonstrate their ability to use the English language and to structure their writing with the target audience in mind. Accompanying this, students will submit a critical commentary in which they will reflect on how an understanding of relevant discourse, stylistic and narratological theory has impacted on their writing. The module will be structured along both theoretical and practical lines, with 2-hour workshops based on input, analysis and practice.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL525 - The Study of Speech

      
      
       This course is an introduction to the linguistic study of speech. It covers how speech sounds are produced and perceived and what their acoustic characteristics are (often referred to as phonetics), as well as how speech sounds are organized into sound systems cross-linguistically (often referred to as phonology). Emphasis will be placed on the sound system of English (including dialectal variation) but basics of sound systems across the worlds languages will also be briefly covered and contrasted with English. Finally, the course will cover the differences between the traditional static view of speech sounds as articulatory postures and the organization of running speech, together with the repercussions that our current knowledge about running speech has for our understanding of phonological systems, their organization and formal representation.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL524 - History of British English

      
      
       The module will begin with a consideration of what the term English means, and of what other, potentially rival, languages have been spoken in the British Isles. It will then consider how successive waves of conquest shaped the sociolinguistic situation to one of di- or triglossia, with English one of a number of varieties used in a restricted set of socially determined domains. Using Haugens standardization model, we will examine the factors which led first to selection and later acceptance of English as the dominant variety, and consider the associated linguistic processes of codification and elaboration of function. Working with short texts from different time periods, the module will then show how and why grammatical changes occurred in Anglo-Saxon, Old and Middle English (e.g. loss of case marking, gender, weakening of the verbal paradigm) and their consequences for the modern language. We will also consider phonological changes (e.g. the Great English Vowel Shift) and their consequences for dialect differentiation. We will conclude by exploring ongoing change in contemporary English (notably koineization in major cities), and the likely consequences for future English in the British Isles.

      LL522 - Morphology

      
      
       This course is an introduction to morphology and to the practice of morphological analysis. By focusing on a range of phenomena, including those falling under inflection, derivation, and compounding (both in English and in other languages), the course helps students develop tools for pattern observation in data, description and analysis of word structure, and hypothesis testing. Students will also gain an understanding of the role of morphology in the grammar and how it relates to other components, such as phonology, syntax and semantics.

      LL519 - Syntax 1

      
      
       This course will introduce students to one aspect of formal linguistics, specifically syntactic theory. Syntax will be defined as one aspect of a persons grammar, to be distinguished from the lexicon, semantics, morphology, and phonology. Focusing on the structure of sentences, the course will examine the principles according to which phrases and structures are formed, as well as speakers knowledge about the structural well-formedness of the sentences they hear and produce. Students will gradually learn to draw syntactic trees that can represent the syntactic operations that they will be introduced to. They will learn to conduct syntactic tests on English and cross-linguistic data, thereby becoming versed with the empirical method. The course will combine both minimalist and earlier government and binding work. We will examine the competence/performance distinction, the notion of I-language, poverty of the stimulus arguments, levels of representation, phrase-structure rules, constituency tests as a means for testing phrase structure, case theory, theta theory, binding and movement.

      LL518 - Stylistics: Language in Literature

      
      
       This module is concerned with the stylistic analysis of literature and is based on the premise that the decision to study literature is also a decision to study the expressive mechanics of language (and vice versa). Attention is given to all three main genres (poetry, prose fiction and drama); thus the module is divided into three blocks according to the kind of text analysed. The first section examines poetry and considers topics such as patterns of lexis, phonetic and metrical organisation and the relationship to meaning; the second looks at fiction through patterns of style variation, inferencing and speech thought presentation; the third examines drama and considers topics such as the patterns in turn-taking and their relationship to the roles and functions of characters, speech act analysis and styles of politeness behaviour. At all stages of the module, the social and cultural context of the works studies will be an important consideration. Subject to change pending faculty approval

      LL513 - Language Variation and Change

      
      
       Weeks 1-4 will explore the reasons for the initial exclusion of extralinguistic (ie. social) data from linguistic theory, and the limitations of traditional dialectology, before exploring some early variationist studies by Trudgill (Norwich) and Labov (Marthas Vineyard; New York) and examining their theoretical bases. Weeks 6-7 will examine the advances brought about by network studies (e.g. Lesley Milroy in Belfast), and the extent to which they offer a challenge to traditional assumptions in sociolinguistic methodology, an issue to which we return in week 8, which critically evaluates the so-called sociolinguistic gender pattern. Weeks 10-12 focus more specifically on issues of change, looking initially at neogrammarian theories and then the claims of Trudgill, James Milroy and others that certain kinds of change are predictable in specific types of social arrangement.

      LL512 - Language Processing

      
      
       This course will focus on the structure of lexical items, the way in which these different lexical items are stored and the nature of the relation between them. Relevant theoretical work in the fields of psycholinguistics and language processing is outlined and discussed. And students will evaluate the efficacy of these theories on the basis of experimental investigations which they themselves will construct and conduct, for example word association experiments, lexicon decision tasks and parsing phenomena.

      PL576 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      LL599 - Dissertation

      
      
       This module enables students to research in depth a linguistic topic. The dissertation topic may be chosen from a list provided by the supervisor, or selected by the student under guidance from the supervisor in an area reflecting the students interests and the supervisors research programme, interests and expertise. The topic will normally build upon a module that the student has undertaken in their second year. In this instance, the student must have gained a minimum of 65% on that module. In the rare case that the chosen topic builds upon an Autumn-term module in the students third year, acceptance is at the supervisors discretion; it is expected that the supervisor will be the convenor of that module and can reach a decision on the basis of their assessment of the students potential and the viability of the project. Topics available for study are subject to the availability of an appropriate supervisor. In order to ensure adequate supervision, supervisors may not accept to supervise more than 3 dissertations in a given year.With guidance from their supervisors, students will identify a research question and apply appropriate methodologies to data collection and their analysis. While the supervisor will be there to guide students, students will take responsibility for setting their own deadlines, working at a pace that suits them, with the aim of submitting a dissertation of 10,000 words early in the Summer term.

      LL538 - First Language Acquisition

      
      
       This course will start by examining the topic of language acquisition, demarcating the domains for linguistic inquiry. It will challenge everyday assumptions about the way in which children acquire language and introduce key theoretical issues, always assessing the validity of each theory on the basis of empirical evidence. The course will examine the biological basis of language and its localisation and lateralisation, using evidence from both typical and atypical populations. It will evaluate the role of input in language acquisition and the extent to which this facilitates linguistic development. All these issues will be set against an understanding of the normal stages of language acquisition, essentially mapping out the linguistic milestones reached by typically developing children to the age of four. An understanding of the interaction between the components involved (phonology, morphology, semantics, rudimentary structure, pragmatics) will provide the empirical backdrop to assess the efficacy of theoretical models introduced. The course will end, having laid the foundations for students to undertake a higher level of research in this area.

       In this module, students continue to develop and explore the themes introduced in LL536 English Language in the Media 1. Here, the focus is on semiotics as applied in the linguistic analysis of a wide range of media discourse types, but with particular emphasis on advertising. Areas covered include: semiotics, the work of Saussure, the British press, multimodality, the new media and social networking.. Also discussed are complex and challenging ideas around the notion of words, signs, and grammar in context. Students will further develop the ability to approach the language of the media critically and to read the press perceptively so as to understand the acute importance of the media in a democratic society.Subject to change pending faculty approval

      PL623 - Advanced Topics in Reasoning

      
      
       The module will cover some of the major topics of the theory of reasoning, with a focus on presenting students with new and exciting research. The syllabus will vary from year to year. The approach will be philosophical and critical, and may involve the close reading of texts. Students will be expected to engage critically with the works being studied and to formulate and argue for their own views on the issues covered. As an indication of the kind of topics covered, the following are three potential syllabi, one of which might operate in any particular year:1. Probability and probabilistic reasoning. This syllabus will present the major interpretations of probability and their connection with the various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. Topics covered might include: the classical interpretation; the logical interpretation; the subjective interpretation; the frequency interpretation; the propensity interpretation; the objective Bayesian interpretation. The key text will be D.A.Gillies (2000): Philosophical theories of probability, Routledge.2. Causality and causal reasoning. This syllabus will present the major theories of causality, including difference-making theories (probabilistic theories, counterfactual theories, agency theories), mechanistic theories (process theories, complex systems theories) and pluralist theories. It will go on to consider methods of causal reasoning in the sciences and the implications of such methods for the metaphysics of causality. In the absence of a comprehensive text, this syllabus will appeal to papers, especially those in the Oxford Handbook of Causation (OUP 2009), and Causality in the Sciences (OUP 2011).3. Invalid arguments. This syllabus will look in detail at methods of assessing the cogency of deductively invalid arguments. In particular it will present the methods of inductive logic for assessing the plausibility of arguments. It will provide an introduction to probabilistic logics and their semantics, as well as to methods of inference in probabilistic logics, with a focus on elementary methods that can be readily acquired by students with little prior training in logic and no prior knowledge of probability theory. In the absence of a text at a suitable level, this syllabus will be accompanied by a set of detailed lecture notes.Convenor: Jon WilliamsonJon Williamson works on various topics connected with reasoning, inference and scientific method, including causal reasoning in the sciences, inductive reasoning, and the nature of probability. The aim of this module is to introduce students to cutting-edge research on topics such as these. Jon is editor of the gazette The Reasoner, co-director of the Centre for Reasoning, and author of books on reasoning such as Bayesian nets and causality (OUP 2005), In defence of objective Bayesianism (OUP 2010) and Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks (Springer 2011).

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses

      PL624 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

      PL639 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations. They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel. However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes. In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist. An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students. However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand. This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight. The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers. Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full. These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

      PL514 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

       What is art? What is an artwork? Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common? If so, what are they? Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided? Do avant-garde works count as art? Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention? What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally? These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course. After that we will consider other issues and questions. What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities? What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way? Why is rock music such a part of our lives? Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery? What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art? Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters? Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code? And what on earth is the point of public art? What is public art?

      PL527 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL643 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      TH619 - Religious Studies and Philosophy in the Classroom

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. This module is aimed at those students who would like to follow a career as Secondary School teachers, but is also suitable to those who would like to combine an academic course with work experience. Placements in a school environment will enhance the students employment opportunities as they will acquire a range of skills. It will also provide the students with the opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of Religious Education and Philosophy in the secondary school context. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other. The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school where each student will have a designated teacher-mentor who will guide their work in school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progress, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school.

      PL570 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL641 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them.
