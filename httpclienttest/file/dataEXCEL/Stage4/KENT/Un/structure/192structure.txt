      PO304 - Analysing British Politics Today

      
      
       Democracy in Britain does not appear to be in a healthy state.  Citizens are less engaged with political institutions, and less trusting in politicians, than they used to be.  Critical questions are being asked about the role and effectiveness of such key institutions as the electoral system and parliament.  Meanwhile, the nature of political authority in Britain is changing rapidly.  Power has been transferred upwards to the European Union, and downwards to devolved bodies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London.  Non-electoral actors such as the media also play an important role in shaping political decisions.  Where does this leave the political system at the start of the 21st century?  Is government in Britain effective and democratic?  Or are Britains political institutions failing?This module provides students with an introduction to some of the key issues facing the political system in Britain today.  The module examines the challenges facing the political system, the effectiveness of existing political arrangements and the merits of institutional reform.  While the focus is domestic, many of the same challenges are also faced by political systems in other west European countries, to which the course will make reference.  The module thus aims to go beyond a simple focus on British politics, by introducing students to some of the key contemporary issues facing many western democracies..

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO314 - Introduction to Political Thought

      
      
       This module introduces students to the study of political concepts that are central to thinking about political life.  Through the study of these concepts students will be introduced to the principal ideas of many of the major figures in the history of Western political thought (for example, Plato, Hobbes, Rousseau and Marx) and to the work of many contemporary political theorists as well (John Rawls, Michael Sandel, Richard Rorty, Susan Okin and others).  In addition, lectures and tutorials will familiarise students with a variety of different debates about how best to understand any given concept (such as, debates about what constitutes 'human nature') as well as how to understand the relationship between different concepts (such as, whether a just society must be an equal one or not).  Moreover, the module is designed to allow students to develop a set of conceptual tools with which to interrogate and shape the political world in which they find themselves; a world which is saturated everyday with competing articulations of the political concepts that we will study in this module.  As such, students should come to develop a subtle appreciation of how the concepts examined on this module are, to greater or lesser degrees, intrinsic to all of their studies in politics and international relations (and related subjects).

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO326 - Introduction to Political Science

      
      
        This core module introduces students to the wide range of different methodologies commonly employed in political science. This includes the scientific method and both traditional and newer forms of research. Students will also be introduced to some of the fields of inquiry that dominate the study of politics, including public choice, social movements, political behaviour, economic development and democracy. The module integrates these two main components to create both an awareness of the breadth of political science and its approaches, ultimately providing students with the foundation for further study in political science. Substantive topics include: the nature of inquiry (questioning and determining what constitutes evidence), methods of comparison, theory and hypotheses. They will also be introduced to and explore quantitative methods, formal methods, experimental methods and empirical quantitative methods. Students will implement basic quantitative research techniques for themselves. Finally, they will be introduced to concepts such as equivalence, selection bias, spuriousness, value bias and ecological and individualist fallacy in order to illuminate the difficulties faced when making comparisons. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO327 - Introduction to Comparative Politics

      
      
       The module introduces students to the empirical study of the key structures, institutions and processes in political life. It does so through the lens of the comparative method, in which political systems are compared and contrasted to test hypotheses about the factors producing similarities and differences across countries and over time. The module first introduces the comparative method, and then discusses the different ways in which political systems can be organized and classified. It focuses on the three key powers in all political systems  executive, legislative and judicial  the intermediate actors that link people to their governments, namely political parties, interest groups and the media, and how citizens behave politically in relations to such institutions and actors. Throughout the module, students are encouraged to identify the factors and the processes leading to different political outcomes across states and over time and to use both qualitative and quantitative data to support their arguments.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PO661 - Fact, Evidence, Knowledge and Power

      
      
       This module is currently under revision as we are adjusting its contents to the changes we have made last year to our first year courses. Students will be emailed updated module information as soon as the review is completed. The revised PO661 module will build on and develop students knowledge of the approaches and methods used in the study of politics and international Relations introduced in the first year of the degree program and the foundation in the analysis of quantitative data established in the second year. We will consider the nature and purposes of descriptive and causal analysis in politics and international relations, thereby developing skills in choosing, using and evaluating the research designs and techniques for the collection and analyses of data used by researchers in these fields.  Emphasis in the course will be placed on a mixed methods approach to political analysis that enables student to integrate, analyse and evaluate both qualitative and quantitative information. In addition to developing a conceptual and theoretical understanding of different approaches to evidence gathering and analyses and how they can be combined, students will also have the opportunity to extent their skills in practical data analyses. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO657 - Political Research and Analysis

      
      
        The study of social and political phenomena is a vast endeavour and this class will serve as an introduction to methods for social science research. This 15 credit intermediate-level module is normally taken in Stage II. It provides a basic, non-technical introduction to the use of quantitative methods in the political sciences for students from a variety of educational backgrounds (including those with very limited knowledge of mathematical terminology and notation). The progression of this course will address scientific research design and methodology and consider many examples of such research In short, it seeks to enable students to read, interpret, and critically assess arguments drawing on quantitative methods in Politics and International Relations. Students with some prior exposure to quantitative methods will have the opportunity to improve their command of statistical software as well as apply their general statistical skills to data sets commonly found in policy and academic work.The module is divided into two main components: In the first part, students will be introduced to both the logic of empirical research in the social sciences and to basic concepts and techniques of descriptive uni-, bi-, and multi-variate data analysis. The second part will focus on uni-, bi-, and multi-variate inferential statistics. ICT skills will be acquired/enhanced of students by the introduction to and use of statistical software (SPSS). The focus will be on student-centred learning and critical reflection of selected examples of quantitative work in seminars and group work.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO658 - The Rise of China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of Chinas hegemonic role in pre-modern East Asia and its political development since the 1840s when it was forced to open up to the outside world and to lay a solid foundation for even more detailed study of present-day China. It deals with a recurrent theme in the study of Chinese politics, that is, how successive Chinese leaderships since the 1840s have reconciled Chinese indigenous political culture with models of modernisations that originated in the West. Focus is on how indigenous and foreign models for state-building and political development have guided Chinese thinking about national rejuvenation and modernisation. This module assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history or politics, and introduces students to the defining features of the Chinese traditional political system, including: Confucianism and Legalism, the causes of the demise of imperial China in 1911, the abortive attempts of republicanism and constitutionalism between 1912 and 1949, the rise of communism, and major political events since 1949 as well as its recent ascendancy. Questions to be explored in this module include: Why did the Chinese imperial system fail to meet the challenges and encroachment from the West and Japan? How did Chinese leaders understand modernisation? Why did Chinese political elites embrace communism? What have been the impacts of revolutions on Chinas external behaviour and relations, post-1949? How has Chinas worldview been socially constructed in its interactions with Western powers? What is Chinas grand strategy for development in the early 21st century?

      PO659 - Resistance, Suffering and Leadership

      
      
       This module will look at the political lives of three of the icons of contemporary world politics: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi. The module will begin with a brief introduction to biographical narrative as a method in political science. We will then discuss these three figures in three blocks of three weeks each, leaving one week for a concluding and comparative discussion (and one reading week). Throughout the module, the key themes of the title  resistance, suffering (sacrifice) and leadership  will serve as a focus as the module considers the lives of Gandhi, Mandela and Suu Kyi and their impact on world politics. Each block will first discuss the political life of the leader in question, after which one week will be devoted to some of his/her key primary writings, leaving one week to consider the meaning of resistance, suffering and leadership in each of the three lives.

      PO654 - Politics of Deeply Divided Societies

      
      
       This module explores the linkages between mediation theory and the practice of conflict resolution in deeply divided societies. Topics include the theory and practice of negotiations, conflict escalation and peace mediations while specific emphasis will be given to the role of regional or international institutions in early conflict prevention. The module applies negotiation theory in the study of state disintegration, demographic and environmental conflict, property rights, federal management and transitional justice. The course engages with the core literature in negotiation theory and exposes students to a number of simulations aiming to improve negotiation skills (identifying best alternatives, revealing or not preferences, identifying win-win arrangements, defeating spoilers and exercising veto rights). Because of the practical skills taught in the module and the interactive nature of in-class simulations, students are expected to attend lectures and tutorials.  Finally, the course examines the role of citizens and community organizations in peace mediations focusing on a number of selected case studies from deeply divided societies specifically Israel/Palestine, the former Yugoslavia, South Africa, Greece/Turkey (including Cyprus & the Kurdish issue), Rwanda and Northern Ireland. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO638 - Political Behaviour in Britain

      
      
       The module examines the nature of political behaviour in Britain today.  It focuses on two key issues.  The first is the way that citizens participate in politics.  The module explores the nature of political participation, and how this has changed in the last few decades.  It also examines the characteristics of people who participate, and the factors that motivate individuals to engage in different forms of political participation.  The second key issue examined is voting behaviour.  The module considers how far electoral decisions are shaped by stable sociological factors, and how far voters today are less closely aligned with parties and more open to the influence of particular policy messages, personalities and media coverage.  Alongside this focus on the behaviour of citizens, the module also considers the activities of key intermediary organisations, such as legislators.  Throughout, the module seeks to develop students understanding and analytical skills, by considering theories and models of political behaviour along with the way data and other evidence can be brought to bear in testing the validity of these models.

      PO646 - Presidents, Parliaments and Democracy

      
      
       This module introduces students to central debates about the influence of different executive formats on democratic government. The course examines the differences between and within presidential, parliamentary and semi-presidential constitutions and examines their consequences for the quality of democracy and for policy outcomes. The course initially focuses on identifying the key institutions and processes that shape the behaviour and strategies of politicians in the executive, before moving on to consider the consequences of these for governance, policy-making and democratic stability. Throughout the central focus is on understanding the extent and the ways that formal political institutions may shape how politicians respond to citizen preferences, bargain with each other to resolve political conflict and choose policies. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about the impact of political institutions on politics, different ways of conceptualizing and measuring democratic performance and encouraged to think about how a broad range of other factors may interact with constitutional formats to shape outcomes. The approach used will be broadly comparative and will use case-specific and cross-national evidence from both developed and less developed democracies in all regions of the world.

      PO652 - Politics in the Classroom

      
      
       The module will begin with training sessions for the students in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of politics drawn from the national curriculum. These sessions will be run by the Partnership Development Office.After training the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a school in Spring term (this session includes time to travel to and from the School, preparation and debrief time with the teacher and in class time with the teacher and pupils  3 hours in total). They will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a topic or talk about aspects of university life. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of citizenship and politics within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project (final taught lesson) in consultation with the teacher and with the module convener. They must then implement and evaluate the project.

      PO660 - International Conflict and Cooperation

      
      
       The course provides an overview of the broad field of international conflict analysis and resolution. Students have the opportunity to explore the motivations driving different forms of conflict, including interpersonal, group and civil violence. Students will also be exposed to a range of theories and approaches used to understand violent conflict, and a number of different methods of conflict resolution (e.g. negotiation, mediation, peacekeeping operations, and transitional justice.) The approach is interdisciplinary and juxtaposes traditional approaches used to study conflict management with new scientific studies of conflict and cooperation.

      PO666 - Religion and International Politics

      
      
       This module introduces students to the complex set of questions surrounding religion in international politics. The module begins by exploring contending political and sociological understandings of religion at the turn of the 20th century. It looks, in particular, at the constructed nature of the categories of the religious and the secular, and at the limits of the secularization thesis, which anticipated the privatization, decline and ultimately disappearance of religion in modernity. The discussion then turns to the relation between religion and secularism in Europe  with a focus on the question of European identity, multiculturalism, the relation between Europe and Islam and the numerous controversies surrounding Islam in Europe  and in the United States  with a focus on the concept of civil religion and the role of religious rhetoric and thinking in US foreign policy, particularly in the so-called war on terror. The module then explores the relation between religion and violence by looking at the role of the 16th and 17th wars of religion in the process of modern state formation and by asking whether there is a genuine connection between religion and violence. The concluding part of the module focuses on the emerging concept of the postsecular, its contending meanings, understandings and possible applications by focusing on the case of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

      PO555 - International Organisation: The UN System

      
      
       This module explores the origins, evolution and role of international organisations in world politics. The aim is to understand how these institutions have developed, why states choose, refuse and fail to use these institutions as a means to achieve their objectives, and to what extent international organisations can promote international cooperation. The module takes the United Nations system as its central focus, but will also consider historical forms of international organisation as well as the processes of global governance. International organisations are involved in a wide variety of issues in contemporary international politics. This module will survey a selection of them, exploring the political differences and questions that arise in international responses to these issues.

      PO667 - War and Peace in International Society

      
      
       The purpose of the module is to enable students to critically engage with the International Society (or English School) approach to International Relations. Combining political theory, IR theory, philosophy, sociology, and history this approach seeks to understand the theory and practice of international politics by reference to the historical development of relations between large scale political entities (from empires, hordes, kingdoms, to the modern nation-state and beyond) and the discourses that have emerged (Machiavellian, Grotian, Kantian) in response to the development of first European international society and eventually world society. The course focuses on the central features of international society - war and peace - as they have been conceived by the three traditions and members of the English School from Martin Wight to more contemporary figures.

      PO669 - Conservatism: Politics and International Relations of the Right

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to familiarise students with the conservative tradition in modern politics. This is achieved by reference to a range of key conservative thinkers selected by the module convenors to help students understand the diversity of the conservative tradition and consider what factors help to cohere it. Comparison within the tradition and across a variety of thinkers is achieved by examining these thinkers views on four basic categories of modern politics, namely the state, the market, society and international relations. In order to meet these broad learning outcomes, essay questions will be designed in order to ensure that students have to compare at least two thinkers. The module is structured around lectures and seminars. The module will be team-taught, allowing for a wider range of teaching and research expertise from both module convenors.

      PO557 - Japan in the World

      
      
       This module explores the place of Japan in todays international system. It not only investigates Japans most important bilateral relationships, such as the Japan-US axis and relations with China, Korea, etc., but also Japans increasing role in multilateral bodies, such as the UN, ASEAN and APEC. Economic questions and security issues will both be addressed alongside the problems of Japanese energy. Students are encouraged to develop an understanding of how the China/Japan conflict gets more important and how Japans perception may differ from those in Europe or the USA.

      PO558 - The Contemporary Politics of Japan

      
      
       This module will examine the domestic politics of Japan, starting with the changes made by the American occupation. We will then explain the institutions and informal practices which maintained long-term one-party-dominant rule of the LDP (1955-1993). Attention will be paid to electoral rules, the government and opposition parties, collusion between the LDP/business/bureaucracy and voting behaviour.Attention will then move to how the system has changed since the 1993 election which saw the LDP lose its majority. We will analyse the successes of Koizumi and the new era of post-Koizumi politics. We will assess the current Prime Minister and how he is running Japan. We will analyse the 2009 DPJ government and assess its' successes and failures. The module will end with assessment of the Fukushima management of the disaster and the new LDP government.

      PO563 - Foreign Policy Analysis and Management

      
      
       This module examines the complex relationship between foreign policy analysis and foreign policy practice.  It does so by exploring shifting approaches to making and examing foreign policy, including the contributions of  IR theory to Foreign Policy Analysis. Historical antecedents of foreign policy as a practice are examined via observations of traditional bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, followed by traditional state-based actors, non-state actors, and the nature of the structure they inhabit. FP decision-making is then examined, followed by the process of foreign policy implementation. The issue of motivation is tackled through analyses of the largely domestic impact of culture, interests and identity and broader effect of intra-state norms, ethics, the issue of human rights. Case studies of key countries reinforce the practical implications of above-mentioned issues throughout the module.

      PO566 - Europe and the World

      
      
       This module focuses on European foreign policy, i.e. the external dimension of European politics, exploring the relationship between Europe and the rest of the world. Following the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU now stands poised to unleash significant foreign policy potential in its neighbourhood, and beyond. The difference between the EU and Europe will be examined in component fashion through the foreign policies of some of the major European states. Thereafter, the foreign policy tools of the EU will be looked at, after moving into an in-depth thematic treatment of the key foreign policy issues facing the EU vis-&agrave;-vis its security, defence, economic, trade and development relations, and its dynamics with rising powers, the US, its eastern and southern neighbours in Central Europe, Asia and North Africa. Other issues include its burgeoning military capacity and a growing set of overseas military missions. Broader themes will include the impact of global developments on Europe, the international significance of European integration and the more general role of Europe in the new world order This course will draw on theories from political science and international relations and concepts defining Europes global role.

      PO592 - Rights, Freedoms and Individualism:Contemporary Liberalism in Question

      
      
       Anglo-American countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, along with many Western European societies, have long prided themselves on their respect for liberal values. More recently, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and agitation for rights and civil freedoms in many Asian countries, liberalism has extended its reach as a source of political thought and action. Liberalism's values, practices and institutions are now admired, emulated, invoked and desired in many parts of the world. In this module, we look at liberalism as a philosophy of politics by studying the work of some of its major contemporary exponents and detractors. We examine the different approaches to liberalism advanced by figures such as John Rawls, Richard Rorty, and Will Kymlicka. To complement our understanding of liberalism, we consider the communitarian criticisms from thinkers like Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, the feminist criticism of liberalism by Susan Moller Okin, and the post-structuralist criticisms from Michel Foucault.

      PO597 - Governance & Politics of Contemporary China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of China's political development in the 20th and early 21st centuries. After a brief overview of China's political history since 1949, it is designed around two core blocks of study.The first block looks at the principal political institutions that include the Communist Party, the government (the State Council), the legislature (the National People's Congress) and the military (the People's Liberation Army).The second block examines the socio-political issues and challenges facing the country in its ongoing development. They range from the prospects of democratisation and the growth of civil society, the issue of quality of life in the areas of the environment and public health, corruption, nationalism and ethnic minorities, national reunification, territorial disputes with neighbouring countries to China's engagement with global governance.A major theme of the module is to address why the Chinese communist regime is more durable and resilient than other non-democratic countries in achieving both economic growth and political stability and acquiring international influence, despite the fact that it faces numerous mounting development and governance  challenges.

      PO611 - Politics of the European Union

      
      
       On any one day in Brussels hundreds of negotiations on European Union (EU) legislation take place on issues ranging from the regulation of financial services in Europe to the promotion of democracy in the EUs near neighbourhood.  The purpose of this module is to introduce students to the negotiation system that is European Union, how it has evolved politically since its creation and how it works, both in theory and in practice.  Students gain an in-depth understanding of the dynamic of European integration over time and the politics behind this process of integration.  Students will analyse the functioning and roles of the EUs main institutional bodies, investigate how legislation is produced and implemented and how the various political actors with a stake in EU decision-making interact both formally and informally.

The purpose of this module is to introduce students to the negotiation system that is European Union, how it has evolved politically since its creation and how it works, both in theory and in practice.  Students gain an in-depth understanding of the dynamic of European integration over time and the politics behind this process of integration.  Students will analyse the functioning and roles of the EUs main institutional bodies, investigate how legislation is produced and implemented and how the various political actors with a stake in EU decision-making interact both formally and informally. The module also addresses key political questions underpinning EU decision-making EU, such as political support for the EU amongst its citizens, the EUs underlying democratic legitimacy and finally its future development.

      PO612 - Policy-making in the EU

      
      
       Since the mid-1980s the EU has experienced an intense period of constitution building with the ratification of more than five amending treaties.  These treaty changes have significantly altered the Unions policy-making process both in terms of competence and policy reach.  Nearly every area of domestic public policy now has some European dimension.  At the same time the EU has also experienced deep economic crisis and increased questioning of the purpose and trajectory of European integration and policy-making.  The focus of this module is on the European Union (EU) as a system of public policy-making at the heart of all these changes. The module will address topics including: the evolution of various flagship EU policies including the Single Market programme, environmental policy, economic and monetary policy, foreign, security and defence policy, and justice and home affairs.  At the end of the module, students will be able to conceptualise and contextualise key developments in EU policy-making.  They will also be able to analyse the kind of political and economic order that has emerged in Europe today as well as the various challenges it faces.

      PO616 - The Politics of Trust (in the USA)

      
      
       Much recent academic and popular commentary has focused on citizens supposed mistrust of government, especially in the United States of America. The central aim of the Politics of Trust is to uncover the reasons for Americans malaise. However, students will also examine other western democracies where trust has fallen to see if these countries experiences can inform our understanding of the US case specifically and the politics of trust more generally. The course begins with a history of trust in America, with an overview of the putative reasons for declining trust in the post-World War II period, with an examination of the experiences of other western democracies. The second part turns to the specific explanations for declining trust as posited by academics and political commentators. Explanations include the crisis of government performance, spin, the internecine warfare between Republicans and Democrats, the changing nature of the modern labour market, declining social capital, and the media.

       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of China's political development in the 20th and early 21st centuries. After a brief overview of China's political history since 1949, it is designed around two core blocks of study.The first block looks at the principal political institutions that include the Communist Party, the government (the State Council), the legislature (the National People's Congress) and the military (the People's Liberation Army).The second block examines the socio-political issues and challenges facing the country in its ongoing development. They range from the prospects of democratisation and the growth of civil society, the issue of quality of life in the areas of the environment and public health, corruption, nationalism and ethnic minorities, national reunification, territorial disputes with neighbouring countries to China's engagement with global governance.A major theme of the module is to address why the Chinese communist regime is more durable and resilient than other non-democratic countries in achieving both economic growth and political stability and acquiring international influence, despite the fact that it faces numerous mounting development and governance  challenges.

      PO592 - Rights, Freedoms and Individualism:Contemporary Liberalism in Question

      
      
       Anglo-American countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, along with many Western European societies, have long prided themselves on their respect for liberal values. More recently, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and agitation for rights and civil freedoms in many Asian countries, liberalism has extended its reach as a source of political thought and action. Liberalism's values, practices and institutions are now admired, emulated, invoked and desired in many parts of the world. In this module, we look at liberalism as a philosophy of politics by studying the work of some of its major contemporary exponents and detractors. We examine the different approaches to liberalism advanced by figures such as John Rawls, Richard Rorty, and Will Kymlicka. To complement our understanding of liberalism, we consider the communitarian criticisms from thinkers like Charles Taylor and Michael Sandel, the feminist criticism of liberalism by Susan Moller Okin, and the post-structuralist criticisms from Michel Foucault.

       This module focuses on European foreign policy, i.e. the external dimension of European politics, exploring the relationship between Europe and the rest of the world. Following the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), the EU now stands poised to unleash significant foreign policy potential in its neighbourhood, and beyond. The difference between the EU and Europe will be examined in component fashion through the foreign policies of some of the major European states. Thereafter, the foreign policy tools of the EU will be looked at, after moving into an in-depth thematic treatment of the key foreign policy issues facing the EU vis-&agrave;-vis its security, defence, economic, trade and development relations, and its dynamics with rising powers, the US, its eastern and southern neighbours in Central Europe, Asia and North Africa. Other issues include its burgeoning military capacity and a growing set of overseas military missions. Broader themes will include the impact of global developments on Europe, the international significance of European integration and the more general role of Europe in the new world order This course will draw on theories from political science and international relations and concepts defining Europes global role.

      PO563 - Foreign Policy Analysis and Management

      
      
       This module examines the complex relationship between foreign policy analysis and foreign policy practice.  It does so by exploring shifting approaches to making and examing foreign policy, including the contributions of  IR theory to Foreign Policy Analysis. Historical antecedents of foreign policy as a practice are examined via observations of traditional bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, followed by traditional state-based actors, non-state actors, and the nature of the structure they inhabit. FP decision-making is then examined, followed by the process of foreign policy implementation. The issue of motivation is tackled through analyses of the largely domestic impact of culture, interests and identity and broader effect of intra-state norms, ethics, the issue of human rights. Case studies of key countries reinforce the practical implications of above-mentioned issues throughout the module.

      PO675 - Politics and IR Internship

      
      
       This module blends practical workplace experience, in the form of an internship in the area of politics and international relations, with taught seminars and private study. The internship will allow students to experience first-hand the practical application of their degree subject in the wider world of work, and will provide the opportunity to develop transferable skills such as teamwork, communication and self-organisation. The taught seminars will provide an opportunity to reflect upon, and develop, knowledge of the sector and its relationship with the academic field of study, using the students internship experiences and a range of other resources. This will include input from School staff and alumni working in relevant fields, as well as appropriate support from employability and careers-guidance professionals.It will be the students responsibility to source and apply for internship opportunities, but assistance will be provided both by the Schools Employability, Internships, Placements and Alumni Relations Officer, and the Universitys Careers and Employability Service. These opportunities should be in an organisation whose aims and activities are broadly related to politics and international relations, and the internship should reflect these activities and give the student the opportunity to work in a way which allows the module learning objectives to be achieved. Students on pre-approved School-administered internships (currently those based with Kent Union and the Representation of the EU Commission to the UK) will also be eligible to take this module. The internship must consist of at least 60 hours of work, but this may be spread across a number of days / weeks and need not be a full-time position. The module convenor will approve of all internship opportunities prior to their commencement and students are advised to liaise closely with the module convenor and other appropriate staff in good time. Internships must finish by the date of the final seminar, and the School will provide all documentation  and relevant insurance  / health and safety checks  to ensure that the placement meets both University and sector requirements and guidance on work-related learning opportunities.

      PO669 - Conservatism: Politics and International Relations of the Right

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to familiarise students with the conservative tradition in modern politics. This is achieved by reference to a range of key conservative thinkers selected by the module convenors to help students understand the diversity of the conservative tradition and consider what factors help to cohere it. Comparison within the tradition and across a variety of thinkers is achieved by examining these thinkers views on four basic categories of modern politics, namely the state, the market, society and international relations. In order to meet these broad learning outcomes, essay questions will be designed in order to ensure that students have to compare at least two thinkers. The module is structured around lectures and seminars. The module will be team-taught, allowing for a wider range of teaching and research expertise from both module convenors.

      PO667 - War and Peace in International Society

      
      
       The purpose of the module is to enable students to critically engage with the International Society (or English School) approach to International Relations. Combining political theory, IR theory, philosophy, sociology, and history this approach seeks to understand the theory and practice of international politics by reference to the historical development of relations between large scale political entities (from empires, hordes, kingdoms, to the modern nation-state and beyond) and the discourses that have emerged (Machiavellian, Grotian, Kantian) in response to the development of first European international society and eventually world society. The course focuses on the central features of international society - war and peace - as they have been conceived by the three traditions and members of the English School from Martin Wight to more contemporary figures.

       This module explores the origins, evolution and role of international organisations in world politics. The aim is to understand how these institutions have developed, why states choose, refuse and fail to use these institutions as a means to achieve their objectives, and to what extent international organisations can promote international cooperation. The module takes the United Nations system as its central focus, but will also consider historical forms of international organisation as well as the processes of global governance. International organisations are involved in a wide variety of issues in contemporary international politics. This module will survey a selection of them, exploring the political differences and questions that arise in international responses to these issues.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PO666 - Religion and International Politics

      
      
       This module introduces students to the complex set of questions surrounding religion in international politics. The module begins by exploring contending political and sociological understandings of religion at the turn of the 20th century. It looks, in particular, at the constructed nature of the categories of the religious and the secular, and at the limits of the secularization thesis, which anticipated the privatization, decline and ultimately disappearance of religion in modernity. The discussion then turns to the relation between religion and secularism in Europe  with a focus on the question of European identity, multiculturalism, the relation between Europe and Islam and the numerous controversies surrounding Islam in Europe  and in the United States  with a focus on the concept of civil religion and the role of religious rhetoric and thinking in US foreign policy, particularly in the so-called war on terror. The module then explores the relation between religion and violence by looking at the role of the 16th and 17th wars of religion in the process of modern state formation and by asking whether there is a genuine connection between religion and violence. The concluding part of the module focuses on the emerging concept of the postsecular, its contending meanings, understandings and possible applications by focusing on the case of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

      PO660 - International Conflict and Cooperation

      
      
       The course provides an overview of the broad field of international conflict analysis and resolution. Students have the opportunity to explore the motivations driving different forms of conflict, including interpersonal, group and civil violence. Students will also be exposed to a range of theories and approaches used to understand violent conflict, and a number of different methods of conflict resolution (e.g. negotiation, mediation, peacekeeping operations, and transitional justice.) The approach is interdisciplinary and juxtaposes traditional approaches used to study conflict management with new scientific studies of conflict and cooperation.

      PO664 - Conflict Analysis and Northern Ireland: History, Politics & Culture

      
      
       This course will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the recent political history of Northern Ireland. The course will be accessible to all students, whether they are new to the topic or not. The main objective of the course is to provide students with a greater understanding of one of the most complex regions within the United Kingdom. Students who take the course will learn about the central issues that underpinned community conflict, why sectarian conflict broke out in the region in the late 1960s, why it continued for so long, and what political dynamics led to the peace process of the 1990s. In addition to looking at the conventional historical and political development of Northern Ireland, the course will also focus on wider aspects of the society such as representations in Irish poetry, music and sport, and the way in which these have mirrored political and cultural relationships within the region.

      PO665 - Advanced Topics in Politics and International Relation

      
      
       This module is designed to offer Stage 3 Politics and International Relations students an opportunity to study a topic in politics and international relations at an advanced level. Participation will be limited to students who have demonstrated strong writing and analytical skills in their Stage 2 coursework (with a minimum average of 60%) and the topics may vary from year to year depending on the research and teaching interests of academic staff. The module will build on the concepts, theories and methods that students have acquired in their previous studies, introducing them to more advanced readings and further developing their knowledge and understanding of the scholarship at the forefront of their discipline in a given issue area. Students will work very closely with academic staff and will benefit from their research expertise and individual feedback in a small group setting. The module will assist students in developing their critical and analytical skills and help them to understand the uncertainty, ambiguity and limits of knowledge concerning their advanced topic in politics and/or international relations.FOR THE 2015/2016 ACADEMIC YEARThree topics will be offered: two in the Autumn Term and one in the Spring Term. Students may only take one topic within this module. Topic title: Global Gender Justice (Autumn Term)This module addresses some of the complex issues regarding achieving justice for women internationally through a thematic examination of classical and cutting-edge scholarship in the areas of gender, security, and human rights. We will interrogate practices of representation of women as victims and explore the cultural, religious, political, and social challenges and barriers to achieving gender justice within the family, the community, the state and global society. We will analyse the effectiveness and limits of international organisations, international human rights instruments, NGOs and activists to bring about change in womens lives. The seminar will be guided by an overall aim to explore the extent to which gender inequality within the state has an impact on state behaviour, with a specific focus on state development and state security. Students gain an awareness of the following themes: the situation of women around the world; the ways in which gender affects social, political, and economic status; the evolving study of gender in international politics (with an emphasis on security and human rights); the political implications of scholarship; and the links between gender, feminism, and activism. The seminar requires previous knowledge of international relations, but will introduce students to feminist theories relevant to the study of gender in international relations. The two-hour weekly seminar will involve a close reading of key texts as a group as well as discussion/debate of the weekly topics. Topic title: India in the twenty first century (Autumn Term)This course introduces students to the central issues and dynamics that define Indian politics today, situating these within their historical development. It examines the shifting dynamics of Indian party politics, the politics of economic reform, the causes and consequences of ongoing economic inequalities, the politics of welfare as well as the Maoist insurgency and its links to conflicts over economic redistribution. The course also examines the politics of identity focussing on how differences of caste, religion, language and region and the often violent conflicts these entail. It will then examine gender relations situating these in the context of social change and shifting power relations. Finally the course discusses the main issues and problems of Indian foreign policy, in particular Indias often fraught regional relations and the search for global power status. In the course of studying these topics, students will be introduced to the key scholars, themes and debates that have defined the political science and political economy literature on India. It does not presume any prior knowledge of Indian politics.Topic title: Russia and its Neighbours (Spring Term)The crisis over Ukraine from 2013 was stark demonstration of the failure to establish an inclusive and mutually legitimate system of European security and international politics after the end of the Cold War. On the one side, Russia was treated as a defeated power, even though the country did not see itself as such, and was assigned a modest role in world affairs. In the end this provoked a type of Weimar syndrome in a country whose dignity and interests were perceived to have been ignored. On the other side, the European Union and NATO have claimed to be advancing a type of post-modern politics in which traditional Westphalian notions of balance of power and geopolitical interests have given way to a benign notion of economic and normative homogenization. Two contrasting visions of world order came into contestation. The module will examine the evolution of Russian foreign policy since the end of the Cold War and its interactions with the EU and N

      PO652 - Politics in the Classroom

      
      
       The module will begin with training sessions for the students in the Autumn term. These will include sessions on the relationship with the teacher, how to behave with pupils, as well as how to organise an engaging and informative session on an aspect of politics drawn from the national curriculum. These sessions will be run by the Partnership Development Office.After training the student will spend one session per week for six weeks in a school in Spring term (this session includes time to travel to and from the School, preparation and debrief time with the teacher and in class time with the teacher and pupils  3 hours in total). They will begin by observing lessons taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act somewhat in the role of a teaching assistant by working with individual pupils or with a small group. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a topic or talk about aspects of university life. Finally the student will progress to the role of teacher and will be expected to lead an entire lesson. The student will be required to keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student will also create resources to aid in the delivery of citizenship and politics within the curriculum. Finally, the student will devise a special project (final taught lesson) in consultation with the teacher and with the module convener. They must then implement and evaluate the project.

      PO653 - Marxism

      
      
       The module is aimed to introduce students to Marxist theory and to enable them to assess both the contemporary and historical significance of Marxism in world politics. Students are expected to read some of the key texts of Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels and to consider varied interpretations and critiques of Marxist methods, writings and theories. Students are also expected to consider the political contexts in which these theories and debates emerged and their implications for political practice. Students are not expected to demonstrate any detailed knowledge of the history of Marxist-inspired governments, regimes or political movements.

      PO646 - Presidents, Parliaments and Democracy

      
      
       This module introduces students to central debates about the influence of different executive formats on democratic government. The course examines the differences between and within presidential, parliamentary and semi-presidential constitutions and examines their consequences for the quality of democracy and for policy outcomes. The course initially focuses on identifying the key institutions and processes that shape the behaviour and strategies of politicians in the executive, before moving on to consider the consequences of these for governance, policy-making and democratic stability. Throughout the central focus is on understanding the extent and the ways that formal political institutions may shape how politicians respond to citizen preferences, bargain with each other to resolve political conflict and choose policies. Students will be exposed to different ways of thinking about the impact of political institutions on politics, different ways of conceptualizing and measuring democratic performance and encouraged to think about how a broad range of other factors may interact with constitutional formats to shape outcomes. The approach used will be broadly comparative and will use case-specific and cross-national evidence from both developed and less developed democracies in all regions of the world.

      PO638 - Political Behaviour in Britain

      
      
       The module examines the nature of political behaviour in Britain today.  It focuses on two key issues.  The first is the way that citizens participate in politics.  The module explores the nature of political participation, and how this has changed in the last few decades.  It also examines the characteristics of people who participate, and the factors that motivate individuals to engage in different forms of political participation.  The second key issue examined is voting behaviour.  The module considers how far electoral decisions are shaped by stable sociological factors, and how far voters today are less closely aligned with parties and more open to the influence of particular policy messages, personalities and media coverage.  Alongside this focus on the behaviour of citizens, the module also considers the activities of key intermediary organisations, such as legislators.  Throughout, the module seeks to develop students understanding and analytical skills, by considering theories and models of political behaviour along with the way data and other evidence can be brought to bear in testing the validity of these models.

      PO645 - Market States and Post Democracy

      
      
       This module is situated at the interface of political theory and political economy. It seeks to explore the complex and multi-faceted links between democracy and capitalism in the period from 1848 to the present day. The particular focus is on relations between the state and the market as well as the evolution of different democratic regimes and market economies. Similar emphasis will be on conceptual issues and empirical evidence (though no statistical or econometric skills will be required).The first part of the module examines the formation of 'market-states', beginning with a critical discussion of this concept. This will be the starting point for a wider engagement with Smithian, Marxist, Keynesian and neo-liberal accounts. The focus will be on those who theorise the conditions for the convergence of state and market. The second part turns to the evolution of democracy in relation to capitalism. A brief survey of the recent post-democracy literature will be followed by a discussion of key concepts. Examples include the conception of capitalism and democracy as "quasi-religions" (Walter Benjamin) and various arguments that formal democratic representation and abstract capitalist exchange engender a "society of spectacle".

      PO654 - Politics of Deeply Divided Societies

      
      
       This module explores the linkages between mediation theory and the practice of conflict resolution in deeply divided societies. Topics include the theory and practice of negotiations, conflict escalation and peace mediations while specific emphasis will be given to the role of regional or international institutions in early conflict prevention. The module applies negotiation theory in the study of state disintegration, demographic and environmental conflict, property rights, federal management and transitional justice. The course engages with the core literature in negotiation theory and exposes students to a number of simulations aiming to improve negotiation skills (identifying best alternatives, revealing or not preferences, identifying win-win arrangements, defeating spoilers and exercising veto rights). Because of the practical skills taught in the module and the interactive nature of in-class simulations, students are expected to attend lectures and tutorials.  Finally, the course examines the role of citizens and community organizations in peace mediations focusing on a number of selected case studies from deeply divided societies specifically Israel/Palestine, the former Yugoslavia, South Africa, Greece/Turkey (including Cyprus & the Kurdish issue), Rwanda and Northern Ireland.

      PO655 - Public Opinion and Polling

      
      
       Democracy rests on the will of citizens.  But how can we identify this will?  Elections are one method; but more regular expressions of citizen views are possible via opinion polls.  Indeed, a range of public and private bodies routinely use polls to identify popular attitudes.  But what are the opinions supposedly revealed by these polls, how do surveys go about identifying opinions and how valid are their results?This module introduces students to the theory and practice of public opinion and its measurement.  The module focuses on two main questions.  First, what is public opinion?  How far do peoples attitudes pre-exist and how far are they instead shaped by the way questions are asked?  Are attitudes informed and considered, or are they largely knee-jerk responses based on little information?  If, in fact, citizens know little about politics, are there ways in which they can, nonetheless, form meaningful views on important public issues?  The answers to these questions are central to the task of assessing the proper role of public opinion in modern democracies.  The second question asks how public opinion is measured.  What are the main features of social surveys, and how well do they measure public attitudes?  This section of the module pays particular attention to the ways that different types of survey can affect the responses that people give, and to the principles and practices of effective survey design.

      PO656 - Humans at War

      
      
       This module aims to investigate the different roles and experiences of human beings at and in war. Following an introduction to issues regarding agency (How do people act in the social world? How much freedom do they have? What impact can their actions have?), the course will examine the roles of combatants (both state and non-state), civilians (men, women and children), and third parties (peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, journalists, and academics). The module will draw on academic literature, but also written, oral and video testimony and artwork to examine these categories first as a social group (examining questions such as age brackets, income brackets, education, life expectancy), then in terms of their political functions and roles, and finally in an attempt to access some degree of experiential knowledge of war and peace. Due to the sensitive nature of the material examined, the module will not be using lecture capture.

      PO659 - Resistance, Suffering and Leadership

      
      
       This module will look at the political lives of three of the icons of contemporary world politics: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi. The module will begin with a brief introduction to biographical narrative as a method in political science. We will then discuss these three figures in three blocks of three weeks each, leaving one week for a concluding and comparative discussion (and one reading week). Throughout the module, the key themes of the title  resistance, suffering (sacrifice) and leadership  will serve as a focus as the module considers the lives of Gandhi, Mandela and Suu Kyi and their impact on world politics. Each block will first discuss the political life of the leader in question, after which one week will be devoted to some of his/her key primary writings, leaving one week to consider the meaning of resistance, suffering and leadership in each of the three lives.

      PO658 - The Rise of China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of Chinas hegemonic role in pre-modern East Asia and its political development since the 1840s when it was forced to open up to the outside world and to lay a solid foundation for even more detailed study of present-day China. It deals with a recurrent theme in the study of Chinese politics, that is, how successive Chinese leaderships since the 1840s have reconciled Chinese indigenous political culture with models of modernisations that originated in the West. Focus is on how indigenous and foreign models for state-building and political development have guided Chinese thinking about national rejuvenation and modernisation. This module assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history or politics, and introduces students to the defining features of the Chinese traditional political system, including: Confucianism and Legalism, the causes of the demise of imperial China in 1911, the abortive attempts of republicanism and constitutionalism between 1912 and 1949, the rise of communism, and major political events since 1949 as well as its recent ascendancy. Questions to be explored in this module include: Why did the Chinese imperial system fail to meet the challenges and encroachment from the West and Japan? How did Chinese leaders understand modernisation? Why did Chinese political elites embrace communism? What have been the impacts of revolutions on Chinas external behaviour and relations, post-1949? How has Chinas worldview been socially constructed in its interactions with Western powers? What is Chinas grand strategy for development in the early 21st century?

      PO634 - Understanding US Foreign Policy: War, Trans- formation and Terror

      
      
       This module offers a comprehensive study of US foreign policy since 1945. Ranging from containment, democratic enlargement, and the war on terror the module introduces students to the concept of grand strategy and the need to understand the broader intellectual platform and foundations of the way in which the United States engages with the world. A number of case studies are used to explore this such as the work of George Kennan, the Vietnam War, and the move towards smart power under presidents Bush and Obama. In addition  to this the course also explores questions on the social construction of state identity in the American national consciousness and how both the media and political elites help to shape public opinion and attitudes that relate to Americas friends, allies, and enemies. The course also explores the concept of soft power as a method of extending American influence and power in the world and questions the idea of American decline.
