Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EC309 - Statistics for Economics and Business

      
      
       The main aim of this module is to provide you with a basic understanding of statistics suitable for the Stages 2 and 3 degree programmes in Economics, Business and Accounting although it is also suitable for students taking other Social Science degrees. This module introduces you to statistical concepts and methods in preparation for Stages 2 and 3 modules in economics; it is a prerequisite for Stages 2 and 3 Economics modules and is a core input to the second year quantitative module, EC511. So as well as learning basic statistics, the module emphasises the interpretation of statistical results; and provides you with the opportunity to apply statistical concepts to economic and business data using calculators and computer software. Work with Excel is an independent study element of the module, and using calculators to undertake basic descriptive statistics is an important focus of the practical problem solving.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SE302 - Foundations of Biological Anthropology

      
      
       This module is an introduction Biological Anthropology and human prehistory.It provides an exciting introduction to humans as the product of evolutionary processes. We will explore primates and primate behaviour, human growth and development, elementary genetics, the evolution of our species, origins of agriculture and cities, perceptions of race, and current research into human reproduction and sexuality.This module is required for all BSc in Anthropology and BA in Social Anthropology students. The module is also suitable for students in other disciplines who want to understand human evolution, and the history and biology of our species. A background in science is not assumed or required, neither are there any preferred A-levels or other qualifications.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EC304 - Principles of Economics

      
      
       Economics looks at the material aspects of peoples lives. It is about how people make choices about what and how to produce and consume. It is about how the difference in economic outcomes between firms, people and countries can be related to the effects of choices they and others have made. It builds on the very simple and plausible assumption that people want to get the most they can, given the constraints they face. Studying economics entails both gaining an understanding of the economies in which we all live, and developing skills to think logically about economic situations. The emphasis in this module is on how economics can help us to understand the society we live in.  The module aims to provide a thorough understanding of economics at an introductory level and provides the basis for all subsequent study you may undertake in economics. The first term covers the principles of microeconomics and the second term develops a framework for understanding macroeconomic events and macroeconomic policy. Throughout the module and in the seminars in particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of economics as an analytical tool for thinking about real world problems. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EC305 - Mathematics for Economics and Business Mode A

      
      
       This Stage 1 module is designed for students who have an A -Level in mathematics, AS mathematics or equivalent qualification. A first-year mathematics module (either Mode A or B) is a compulsory part of all economics degree programmes and these modules take place in the Autumn term with a statistics module following on in the Spring term. If you are unsure whether your mathematical background is equivalent to an A level pass, please consult the Module Convenors when you arrive at the University. The aim of the module is to provide you with a good understanding of the mathematics necessary for your Stages 2 and 3 Economics modules.The teaching of each topic starts from first principles, but the speed of the module assumes that you have studied mathematics before (but not economics). By the end of the module, you will have covered the important uses of mathematics in economics (and business) and be able to use many mathematical techniques commonly used to analyse economic (and business) problems. In the long term, the analytical and quantitative skills you acquire from this module are relevant to many different occupations.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EC306 - Mathematics for Economics and Business Mode B

      
      
       The main aim of this module is to provide you with a basic understanding of mathematics suitable for the Stages 2 and 3 degree programmes in Economics, Business, and Accounting. The mathematics material is developed in a clear, contextual framework, and is linked  to a Stage 1 module in Economics. You develop your understanding with suitable problem sets combining mathematical concepts and economic methods.

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SE586 - Ethnographies 1

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of reading four professional ethnographic monographs in their entirety.  The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the thematic topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology I module, i.e. Kinship and Social Organisation, and Economic Systems.  Students will be expected to come to seminars with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology I.  Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier class meetings, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE587 - Ethnographies 2

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of professional ethnographic monographs of varying length to be read at the rate of one (or selected substantial parts of one) monograph per week. The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the analytical topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology 2 module, thereby divided into two congruent blocs. These are labelled Power and Authority and Belief and Practice [see Module specification for SE 589]. Students will be expected to come to class with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology 1. Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier classes, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      SE588 - Advanced Social Anthropology 1: Power and Economy

      
      
       The module is a cross-cultural analysis of economic and political institutions, and the ways in which they transform over time. Throughout the term, we draw upon a range of ethnographic research and social theory, to investigate the political and conceptual questions raised by the study of power and economy. The module engages with the development and key debates of political and economic anthropology, and explores how people experience, and acquire power over social and economic resources. Students are asked to develop perspectives on the course material that are theoretically informed and empirically grounded, and to apply them to the political and economic questions of everyday life. The module covers the following topics: the relationship between power and authority; key concepts and theoretical debates in economic anthropology; sharing and egalitarianism; gift exchange; sexual inequality; violence; the nation state; money; social class; work; commodification; financialisation. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE589 - Advanced Social Anthropology II: Religion &  Cosmological Imagination

      
      
       This module is focused on a diverse range of approaches deployed by anthropologists to the study of religion, and belief and symbolic systems. It introduces a range of an-thropological insights to the ongoing transformations of religious traditions and belief systems vis-&agrave;-vis colonial encounters, post-colonial settings, as well as globalisation. The aim of the module is to familiarize students with the complex interactions between lived religious practice, religious traditions, and the ways in which these are intertwined with other domains of social life, politics, economics and ideology. The key topics covered in this module focus on ritual and sacrifice; witchcraft and sorcery; secularisation and fundamentalism; millennialism and conversion; cosmology and ideology; human and non-human relationships; modes of religiosity, rationality and belief; mediation and ethics. This module will develop students awareness of the strengths and limitations of anthropological insights compared to other disciplinary perspectives on religion such as theology, cognitive science or sociology.

      EC500 - Microeconomics

      
      
       This is the core microeconomics module taken by all students following Economics degrees. It builds on the material covered in the Stage 1 Economics modules. The titles of many of the topics covered will be familiar, but the topics are dealt with in greater depth than in first year.Microeconomics is concerned with the behaviour of individual economic agents such as consumers, firms and governments. It provides the foundations for understanding all types of economics, including macroeconomics, so is relevant for all other Economics modules you take.The module is carefully designed to give (alternative and/or complementary) readings, and provide a set of different types of questions and problems for seminars to test and extend your understanding of the material as well as to improve your key skills such as communication, problem solving, team work, and learning how to study efficiently.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EC502 - Macroeconomics

      
      
       Macroeconomics today is a different subject than it was just a few decades ago. Old controversies have been resolved and new ones have arisen. This module builds on the first year teaching of macroeconomics to provide an intermediate course, which takes full account of the policy issues and controversies in the world macroeconomy.Autumn Term begins by looking at the basic methodology of macroeconomic models. We then examine, in greater detail than at Stage 1, how the macroeconomic theories of aggregate demand and aggregate supply are derived. This involves studying the markets on which these theories are based. It is important to be aware that there are many theories of aggregate demand and supply. This term we use the IS-LM model, with which you should be familiar from Stage 1, to derive a theory of aggregate demand in both open and closed economies. We also examine the labour market to derive a theory of aggregate supply and study the relationship between inflation and unemployment.Spring Term starts with studying the long-run, that is, what determines the standard of living of countries in the long term, as opposed to short-run economic fluctuations. We then study microeconomic fundamentals of macroeconomics to understand in-depth the determinants of consumption, investment, and labour supply decisions. We then use these and the ideas developed last term to extensively examine macroeconomic demand management policies (fiscal and monetary) and their shortcomings. We finally study the role of the financial system in the macroeconomy and the causes behind the recent crisis starting in 2008.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      SE592 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies

      
      
       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE601 - European Societies

      
      
       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SE547 - South East Asian Societies

      
      
       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

      EC511 - Quantitative Economics

      
      
       The quantitative estimation and evaluation of economic models is an essential feature of the study and application of economics. An alternative title for this module is (applied) econometrics where metric in econometric denotes measurement. Most textbooks provide a useful definition of what is meant by econometrics. Andrew Oswald has described economics as the art of looking for patterns in data. Joshua Angrist and J&ouml;rn-Steffen Pischke have described econometrics as the art of investigating causal relationships of interest. We provide an intuitive treatment of some elements of basic econometric theory in conjunction with the practical application of the methods to economic issues, in particular we emphasise the measurement and interpretation of empirical results. Hence we choose the title Quantitative Economics, even though other techniques are often taught under such a heading; for instance, linear programming and input-output analysis. This also differentiates this module from the final year modules, EC542 and EC543 Econometrics I and II, which explore econometric techniques in greater theoretical and empirical depth. The aim of the module is to familiarise you with the techniques economists use to measure economic relationships in order to test hypotheses, forecast, or assess the impact of economic policy. This is a very challenging field of applied economics. We do this in a practical way so that you gain experience in using suitable computer software to investigate empirical relationships studied throughout the module. Learning to use computer software provides a basic training in information technology (IT) skills which are becoming increasingly important to employers seeking suitable, skilled employees.

      EC531 - Policy Analysis

      
      
       This module applies economic theory and statistical methods to the understanding and critical assessment of economic policy. It is designed for students who have completed Stage 1 Economics. For students studying for an economics degree, the module complements the core second year modules by focusing on the policy application of economic concepts and provides an introduction to material studied in greater depth in third year specialist modules. For other students, it provides the opportunity to consider an economists perspective on important policy issues. A key aspect of this module is the relationship of economics to current and ongoing policy problems.The module introduces you to a variety of contemporary, mainly microeconomic, policy issues. Alongside formal lectures, it also consists of several workshops, which provide opportunities to develop and demonstrate your problem solving and analytical skills. They also give guidance on identifying sources in the literature, data relevant to economic research, analysis of data and the presentation of results orally, as well as in writing. This focus provides opportunities to develop a range of highly transferable skills and lay the foundations to the independent learning skills you require for many of the modules in Stage 3.  

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EC532 - Environmental Economics, Institutions and Policy

      
      
       This module introduces you to environmental economics and economics generally. A key objective of the module is to help you develop an ability to apply economic thinking to environmental problems. The module considers various aspects of environmental economics including why pollution occurs and how policy can be designed and implemented to deal with it, how to place economic value on the environment and how to understand sustainable development in microeconomic terms.The module is divided into three parts. In Part A we examine the relationship between the economy and the environment. In Part B we consider how environmental policy can be designed, implemented and evaluated in relation to environmental pollution. In Part C we examine issues of environmental valuation, which is a rapidly growing area of research in environmental economics. The emphasis in all parts of the course is to understand the links between theory and practice.

      EC534 - The Economics of Money and Banking

      
      
       The module asks what determines the set of equilibrium prices required to provide an appropriate level of savings in an economy to finance the expected level of expected activity. It tries to link models of money, banking and finance into one generic, or foundation, view. Specifically, we shall move towards an understanding of how financial and economic innovation have moved hand in glove over many centuries and how it seems to be that when finance fails, so does the modern market economy. Some of the questions we consider are: How can we analyse the appearance of money in an economy? What is the link between money and finance? What explains bank runs? Why is it so difficult to explain exchange rates? Can we explain the occurrence of financial crises? This second-year optional module emphasises both historical experience and analytical techniques. The economic analysis of financial markets and instruments is the starting point for understanding financial markets. This module is desirable for students wanting to take EC562 in Stage 3.

      EC538 - Economic Controversies

      
      
       The idea of this module is to teach the skills of economic reasoning and argument by exposing students to the big debates within the discipline and in economic policy. The module draws on current and past controversies across many economics sub-disciplines. This equips students with the ability both to understand and contribute to the debates surrounding the recognised controversies within the discipline at a level consistent with an intermediate undergraduate degree course in Economics. The curriculum also provides an insight into the academic and professional development of the discipline. Four controversies are covered each academic year drawn from a range of topics pertinent to the discipline and relevant sub-disciplines. The list of controversies are framed in the form of a question but can be identified as specific topics as required. The list below is indicative only:1. What should governments do? How far should they intervene in markets, families and the way individuals make choices?2. What is the best way to understand business cycles? What policies can/should governments adopt to help households and firms deal with such fluctuations3. Many economists assume individuals are perfectly rational and fully informed. Is this a sensible and useful way of understanding the economy?4. Is the living wage a good idea?5. How successful were economists at explaining the recent financial crisis?6. Is Free Trade Fair Trade?7. What is the best way of understanding inflation?8. Are currency unions ever a good idea? 9. What is the best way of helping the long term unemployed and their families?

      EC540 - Development Economics

      
      
       There is a wide range of views and approaches to the study of economic development spanning the whole of the political spectrum from the Marxist left to the libertarian right, and also a rich historical literature. To understand the module, some prior knowledge of economic theory and statistics is required, and a willingness to read widely. But the aim of the module is to teach the basic principles of economic development in order to answer such questions as:Why are there divisions in the world economy between rich and poor countries? How did these divisions arise and what forces perpetuate them? How important are such factors as agriculture, industry, investment performance, population growth, domestic finance, international finance and trade in explaining the economic performance of nations? What role does economics in general have to play in an understanding of why some countries are poor and others rich?

      EC541 - Economics Dissertation

      
      
       This dissertation is a 30-credit module based on self-directed study, which allows you to develop a complete piece of work within the general field of economics, from the initial idea through to a final written report. It is unique amongst the modules you are taking towards your degree in Economics, both in the ways that you learn and in the ways that you are assessed. Your learning will be largely independent, but is supported by structured supervision from your dissertations supervisor and weekly computing sessions to help in accessing, coding analysing and interpreting your data.

      EC542 - Econometrics I: An Introduction to Modern Econometrics using Stata

      
      
       This is a 15-credit module in applied econometrics using Stata (the most popular general-purpose statistical software package used by empirical economists), for students who have followed Stage 1 modules in mathematics and statistics and who have taken the Stage 2 module in quantitative methods (EC511) or equivalent. What distinguishes this module is the adoption of the modern learning-by-doing approach to teaching econometrics, which emphasises the application of econometrics to real world problems. The focus is on understanding the theoretical aspects that are critical in applied work and the ability to correctly interpret empirical results.

      EC543 - Econometrics 2: Topics in Time Series

      
      
       Empirical research in macroeconomics as well as in financial economics is largely based on time series, ie chronological sequences of observations, showing the development of quantities, goods and asset prices, and interest rates. The module offers an introduction to contemporary time-series econometrics, linking the theory to empirical studies of the macroeconomy. Topics include: stationary and non-stationary stochastic processes; linear autoregressive and moving average models; linear difference equations; autoregressive distributed lag models; cointegration and equilibrium correction; vector autoregressive models. These topics are illustrated with a range of theoretical and applied exercises, which are discussed in seminars and computer classes.The module introduces you to the research methods used by macroeconomists in academia, government departments, think tanks and financial institutions. It also helps you to prepare for the quantitative requirements of a masters programme in economics.

      EC544 - Economic Integration in the EU

      
      
       The European Union features strongly in all discussions of economic policy and political decision making. Frequently economists are unable to provide a consistent analytical framework for the analysis of the various issues posed. In this module we explore the meaning and analysis of regional economic integration in the context of the EU. This provides a general introduction to the economic rationale for the existence of the EU, the working of some of its main policy areas, and a critique and assessment of the achievements to date. The module deals first with the origins of the EU, the theory of a Customs Union and questions of trade integration. Secondly, it covers the problems and relevance of monetary integration and the common currency area to the process of economic integration. Thirdly, it deals with some specific policy areas, in particular labour market policies, common agricultural policy and competition policy. At the end of this module you are expected to have knowledge of the basic theories underlying customs unions, and of the rationale for, and strength and weaknesses of, policy intervention at EU level. This is a module in applied economics and the emphasis throughout is on the development of appropriate economic theories and their application in the specific context of the EU. It is not concerned with the detailed discussion of the Treaties or the implementation of policy measures. Decision making in the EU is introduced in order to understand the question of the exercise of economic power. The nature of the economic role of the European Union is such that this involves a broad coverage of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, often involving applied issues and applied analysis going beyond that covered in the main theory courses.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EC545 - Economics of the Labour Market

      
      
       Unemployment has become one of the biggest economic challenges facing many countries, placing the labour market at the core of current economic debate. Understanding the labour market is a prerequisite for informed discussions of issues surrounding the unemployment problem as well as other important topics like discrimination and immigration. The first part of the module follows a fairly conventional approach to the study of labour economics, and covers the supply and demand for labour. We incorporate policy-orientated material throughout  for example, we examine the incentive effects of taxation and unemployment benefits on labour supply, and discuss the effect of pay-roll taxes on labour demand. The second part of the module covers the process of wage determination and unemployment. We analyse the dynamic behaviour of unemployment from a flow perspective (the ins and outs of unemployment) and introduce the role of matching and search frictions to explain the presence of frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment exists because, even if there are as many vacancies as unemployed workers, in a labour market with imperfect information workers and firms need to spend time to meet and create a new employment relationship. Finally, the module analyses the dramatic rise in unemployment in some OECD countries over the last economic crisis, focusing particularly on the role played by the labour market institutions. During the module you attend computer sessions to learn how to solve the labour supply model and the labour market equilibrium with the Excel Solver. The basic function of applied sessions in these labs is to improve your analytical skills in a dynamic and interactive way. The Excel Solver is described as a user-friendly and flexible tool for economic optimisation.

      EC546 - Games for Economics and Business

      
      
       The growing use of game theory by economists suggests that a professional economic education is incomplete without a firm understanding of this new tool. The module aims to introduce you to a topical and important research area of microeconomic analysis, to develop your skills in setting up and solving games that arise in business and economics, and to enable you to apply game theory to different areas of economics and business.

      EC547 - Industrial Economics

      
      
        Industrial Economics studies why and how firms and industries behave and interact with each other. This is probably one of the most important and interesting areas in economics. Understanding firms' behaviour is relevant not only to the firms but also to the governments that design industrial policies in order to favour consumers without decreasing firms' efficiency.During the module, we deal with issues that are present in everyday news: anti-competitive practices, the effect of market power on consumer welfare and the incentives for product innovation, and private and public effects of mergers. You have the chance to discuss and understand many of these topics in a deeper and more economically informed way.This module has been designed for students who have already taken intermediate microeconomics. You are encouraged to apply economic analysis and techniques to understand the behaviour of firms and industries.

      EC548 - International Finance

      
      
       When we open a newspaper or an economics and business magazine, we often read topics related to monetary and financial relations between countries. A good deal of political debate is also focused on the various aspects that constitute international finance. However, these debates do not allow us to understand their theoretical underpinnings. This is what we are going to study in this module from a rigorous perspective. The first part of the module deals with some basic concepts of international macro such as the balance of payments and exchange rates, and arbitrage conditions. We then go on to analyse the impact of opening up the economy on the alternative macroeconomic policies available. In that part we also analyse the main factors that determine the exchange rates between currencies, and the power of the different models proposed. The third part of the module deals with hot topics in international finance. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of fixed and floating exchange rates, the concept of a speculative attack, how to understand current account imbalances from an inter-temporal perspective, and how world macroeconomic imbalances drove the 2008/09 international financial crisis and recent sovereign debt crisis in Europe.The module has both a theoretical and an applied emphasis in order to insert the available theories into the real problems of the world economy. It does not analyse the detailed workings of international financial markets or questions related to firm financial management in international capital markets but students interested in these aspects can acquire basic foundations that are fundamental in understanding the context in which firms and governments work.

      EC549 - International Trade

      
      
       The study of international trade has always been an especially lively and controversial area in economics. Yet there was never a time when the study of international trade was as important as today. The economies of different countries are more dependent on each other than they have ever been before, meaning that, among other things, regional crises can spread throughout the world. Keeping up to date with this changing international environment and being able to understand the dynamics behind it is of key importance to firms and governments.

      EC550 - Monetary Economics

      
      
       This final year optional module covers a variety of monetary issues from both a theoretical and a policy perspective. It starts with an introduction to the role of money in the economy, and theories of money supply and demand. A discussion of the IS/LM model gives a basic foundation for analysing how monetary policy affects the economy, and a first theoretical perspective on the neutrality of money  ie whether monetary policy has real effects on the macroeconomy, in either the short or long run. This is followed by a discussion of other theoretical perspectives on neutrality, and relevant evidence. If monetary policy does have real effects, how are these brought about and what are the implications for monetary transmission? The remainder of the module discusses current issues in monetary policy  the goals of monetary policy and how these are expressed in modern simple models of monetary policy, central bank independence and inflation targeting.

      EC553 - Public Economics

      
      
       To understand and be able to evaluate the role played by government in the economy it is important to understand key elements of microeconomic analysis and then be able to apply this understanding to the practical evaluation of policy issues. Economic theory is typically a positive science with right and wrong answers but evaluating policy issues is a much more normative science where there are often no correct answers (just opinions). The module reflects these two sides of studying public economics.

      EC562 - Economics of Finance 1

      
      
       The economic analysis of financial markets and instruments is the starting point of financial economics and this module provides a concise overview of capital markets. Specifically, it examines how the economics of uncertainty have been applied extensively in financial markets. It focuses on the structure of each financial market (such as the trading volume and investors in it), recommended investment strategies for a specific type of investor, and market conventions. We emphasise both practical knowledge and analytical techniques and several useful mathematical skills are explained. The module first introduces key principles, such as discounting, diversification, no arbitrage and hedging, and then discusses each asset class, such as bonds, equities and their derivatives (instruments), emphasising the general idea behind them. Although different types of assets require different methods of valuations and risk control, the basic principles are common to all asset classes. The module also covers asset liability management (ALM) and other related topics.

      EC563 - Economics of Finance 2

      
      
       The module develops your skills in asset pricing and your understanding of the theoretical basis of this subject. It stresses practical training in asset pricing. The two main topics in the module are investors utility maximisation and arbitrage theory in derivative pricing, which is mainly discussed in discrete time models. The most important goal is to give you the ability to apply the model to real data.Although the module requires some mathematical techniques, its aim is to offer practical training, putting stress on the intuitions and heuristics behind theorems and formulae, rather than their rigorous derivations and semantic definitions. Moreover, you are not only expected to understand theories but also expected to master how to use them.

      EC565 - Extended Economics Essay

      
      
       The module aims to provide an alternative to the EC541 dissertation option for students. In this module, rather than conducting an original piece of research, you are given a set of questions with readings. You can also construct your own question so long as it is approved. You choose a question and (with help from your supervisor) write a 5,000 word essay on this question. The material covered in these essays is typically broader than that explored in the dissertation option and there is no requirement to make any 'contribution to knowledge'. However, the essays still demand more independent work than required for coursework in other modules. You are expected to read round the question AND to assimilate concepts and ideas not covered in lectures.

      EC568 - World Economic and Financial History from the 19th Century

      
      
       The aim of the module is to introduce you to the evolution of the world economy from the 19th century to the present. This period experienced rapid growth of trade, saw a massive migration from Europe to the Americas and the rise, fall and rise again of globalisation. A knowledge of the history of the world economy in this period allows us to understand todays world economy better; enlightens our understanding of world income inequality, trade patterns and sources of growth; and teaches us important policy lessons from past recessions and recoveries.Topics covered on the module include growth and trends pre-1913 and the interwar years; the gold standard; commodity and labour market integration; the Great Depression; and recovery from the Great Depression.

      EC569 - Economic Growth

      
      
       This module covers a variety of growth issues from both empirical and theoretical views. The first part of the course deals with basic concepts of economic growth, including how to measure growth and the core theories of economic growth. The second part deals with productivity; how to measure productivity and analyse different sources of productivity growth. The third part deals with economic fundamentals, including the relationship between government policies, income inequality, and growth. The aim of the module is to teach the basic principles of economic growth in order to answer such questions as:- what are the determinants of growth?- how can we improve productivity?- what kind of role does the government play on growth? - why are there differences in the level of income among countries?

      EC570 - Microeconomics of Development

      
      
       In the last 30 to 35 years, the study of economic development has increasingly focused on the behaviour of individuals  their opportunities, constraints, and choices  to understand the causes and nature of poverty, and on formulating strategies for improving their economic well-being. This trend includes the increased application of microeconomic theories to understand phenomena related to underdevelopment, the collection and analysis of data at the individual level (as opposed to the regional or national level) and, most recently, the use of lab and field experiments to better understand individual behaviour. The module introduces you to these trends, to show how the related microeconomic tools have contributed to a better understanding of the process of economic development. Some of these methods are now widely used by international development agencies  such the World Bank and DfID  as well as academic researchers to critically assess development strategies and evaluate programmes aimed at improving the economic well-being of the poor in developing countries.

      EC571 - Agricultural, Food and Natural Resource   Economics

      
      
       This module introduces you to agriculture, food and natural resource economics and economics generally. A key objective is to help you develop an ability to apply economic thinking to problems in this area. The module considers various aspects of agricultural, food and resource economics including food production, economic theory related to agricultural policy, food supply chains and food prices, food economics specifically food labels and various economic aspects of natural resource management such as forestry and fisheries. The module is divided into three parts. In Part A we examine the relationship between the economy and the agriculture. In Part B we consider aspects of food economics. In Part C we examine various issues relating to natural resource.  The emphasis in all parts of the module is to understand the links between theory and practice.
