      FI590 - Filmmaking: Improvisation for Screen

      
      
       This interdisciplinary module brings Film and Drama Single Honours students together to explore improvisational techniques that increasingly animate both independent filmmaking and contemporary drama practice.  Practical workshops provide technical instruction and creative focus on actors improvisation as a rehearsal technique, a screenplay development technique, and a performance technique during filming. Exploration of improvisation as screen craft will be complemented by the theorisation of improvisation in lectures that also provide a historical context and introduce film artists use of aleatory techniques in production and postproduction, live cinema, and the use of real or improvised dialogue and verbatim accounts in documentary and animated films. Connections between theatrical and cinematic trends that utilise forms of improvisation will be emphasised while students practical projects will respond to and expand upon these growing synergies between cinema and theatre in the digital age.

      FI565 - British Cinema

      
      
       In a country with a very strong literary and theatrical tradition, the British have also had a long-standing love of "going to the pictures."  For more than a century, British filmmakers have been forging a rich and diverse national cinema in the face of Hollywoods dominance on British screens for most of that time.  This course will offer an introductory historical overview of British cinema from its beginnings to the present day, assessing its role in the construction of British national identity, evaluating its major directorsincluding Humphrey Jennings, Ken Loach and Sally Potter. The films will be approached through multiple frameworks, including consideration of aesthetics (e.g. realism), culture (e.g. gender and class), and history (e.g. the legacy of colonialism).  The institution of cinema and film culture in a larger sense will be considered through the exploration of British film exhibition, criticism, cultural policy, and industry.  Both fiction films and documentaries will be discussed.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI537 - Postwar European Cinema

      
      
       This course investigates some major aesthetic, political, and theoretical trends of postwar European cinema. Students are introduced to a selection of European films as well as to the writings of key Continental filmmakers, theorists and critics. Students will examine the new waves from France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, and the neo-realism originating in Italy, as well as movements such as Dogme '95. The module also looks at the impact of popular European genre cinema, including analysis of the horror movie and the Spaghetti Western. In addition, the module will also have a contemporary scope, with a study of more recent developments in European film. The films will be examined for their claims to interpret the real world, their relationship to films in other national contexts, and also be interrogated for the economic and artistic motivations behind their existence as critical categories.

      FI594 - Film Authorship

      
      
       This module will offer students the rare opportunity to examine in detail the work of a single director or a group of directors. It will thus enable students to acquire a more complex understanding of the issues at stake in the production, distribution, and reception of a specific body of film work. The module will also develop students knowledge and understanding of the questions, theories and controversies, which have informed critical issues and theoretical debates on film authorship. It will thus appeal to students who wish to extend their skills in analysing film form, meaning, and practice in both a conceptual and a historical context. Furthermore, as the module will enable detailed consideration of what film directing is, as an artistic and cultural practice, in given contexts, it will be a very useful course to combine with the practical study of filmmaking.

       This module studies individual genres, which may vary across different academic terms (it may focus on the horror, science-fiction, western, musical, comedy, the noir or the gangster film, among others). It combines aesthetic and narrative analysis with the history of the genre. The theoretical framework draws from Marxist, psychoanalytical, feminist, and reception theories. The historical portion of the course examines the genres growing commercial viability, the proliferation of subgenres, and the growing attention of academics. Topics include gender politics, representations of sexuality, and political commentary and allegory.

      FI599 - The Gothic in Film

      
      
       This module will investigate the Gothic as a significant and recurring cycle within Hollywood film with recognisable tropes and themes, and a dominant tone and style. Beginning with the cycle of Womens Gothic which emerged at the same time as Film Noir, and visually and thematically overlapped with it, the module will explore the particularly filmic ways that such texts manage to evoke the menacing atmosphere and the tone of sexualised danger and suspense achieved by the Gothics source novels and short stories. Continuing from the original cycle of 1940s films, the module will examine later Hollywood films that have employed the themes and imagery of the Gothic to tap into similar complex anxieties and desires, before inspecting films from other cinemas (for example, those of Europe and Asia) which also make use of the dominant Gothic tropes.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

       This module addresses a series of documentary films in their historical context and in relation to the different modes of non-fiction filmmaking. Documentary narrative techniques including the use of archival footage, staged reconstructions of past events, and talking-head interviews, are investigated by means of close textual analysis and through a comparative approach to diverse documentary films. This module also explores the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction and, while articulating a definition of documentary film, it studies film forms that present an interplay between the two, such as Mockumentaries and Essay Films.

      FI603 - Sound and Cinema

      
      
       Cinema has typically been conceived of as an essentially visual phenomenon  films, it is often said, are essentially moving pictures. Sound has, nevertheless, played an important role from the beginnings of cinema, a fact which has been acknowledged in the detailed historical, theoretical and critical work on film music, and film sound more generally, produced over the last decade. Sound and Cinema will provide an overview of this new field of research, and aim to provide students with a clearer understanding of and greater sensitivity to the soundtrack. The course will begin by setting up an introductory framework for the understanding of sound, which considers the relationship between music and other aspects of film sound (dialogue, voice-over, effects), as well as the nature of the relationship between image and sound. Subsequent sessions will consider the evolution of sound technology and its impact on the aural aesthetics of film; the use of classical and popular music in film scores; the emergence of sound designers, such as Walter Murch and Alan Splet, in contemporary cinema; and the distinctive and innovative use of sound and music by such diverse directors as Wim Wenders, Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch, and William Raban.

      FI604 - Digital Domains

      
      
       The module primarily focuses on contemporary digital filmmaking practices and film viewing. The first section of the module introduces trick cinema, special effects, the digital intermediate, and a range of computer generated images to explore the different opportunities these offer for manipulating space, constructing narratives and aesthetic innovation. The second section of the module more explicitly engages with a range of theoretical frameworks in order to think about how digital technologies alter our understanding of film, its relationships with other media, and the ways in which we participate in film culture.

      FI607 - Storytelling and the Cinema

      
      
       This module examines different forms of narrative and story-telling in cinema, drawing upon theories of myth, folk and fairytale as well as upon anthropological studies of oral storytelling in order to place film narration within the tradition of the popular arts. The psychological and aesthetic role of narrative will be explored through the accounts offered by philosophy and psychoanalysis in order to understand the relations and tensions between narrative realism based on Aristotelian notions of cause and effect as well as character verisimilitude, and popular and avant-garde modes which transgress such notions.  The role played by, for example, film genres and the star system in disrupting or supporting narrative cause and effect will be considered.   The function of the script and of script-writing will be looked at in relation to the deployment of the cinematic elements of sound and image, spectacle and event in film.  The course will be taught through a series of case-studies using a wide range of films within American and world cinema.

      FI611 - New York & The Movies

      
      
       This module examines the way New York has been used as a site for filmmaking, looking at the history of the production of films in and about the city, and as a vital centre of film culture -- not just of filmmaking, but also exhibition and film criticism. Beginning with an examination of film, and modernity, with a specific focus on late silent/early sound film production, the module then shifts to look at avant-garde practice in New York during the 1950s and 60s, and concludes by considering the citys representation in mainstream Hollywood productions with a particular focus on generic crime movies and/or romantic comedies.  The work on New York and film will be contextualised within a cultural history of the city, with a dual emphasis on narratives of immigration and the city as the postwar centre of the world art market.

      FI618 - Screenwriting: An Introduction

      
      
       This module offers students an introduction to the terms, ideas and craft, involved in the creation of screenplays. Screenwriting is a unique form of writing with very different concerns from the novel, theatre and radio. Although the screenplay is a vital component of a films success, it tends to be neglected as a separate art form.In this module we explore the conventions of dramatic structure, new narrative forms and short film variations. Students are encouraged to think critically about screenplay writing and will have an opportunity to write their own screenplay. A selection of writing exercises have been designed to take them through the writing process; from preparation and initial concept to final draft.The emphasis here will be on practical knowledge and support as students uncover their creative voice. This module does not aim to provide vocational training for students wishing to pursue careers in the feature film or television industries.

      FI622 - Television Series: Narration, Engagement and Evaluation

      
      
       The module explores storytelling in fictional television series, and how the long duration of these series changes the spectators engagement, as compared to engagement in the relatively short fiction film. Furthermore, this module focuses on case studies in order to investigate their narrative, stylistic and thematic characteristics, their specific genre conventions and their background in television history. Case studies may include The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Madmen in an inquiry into the narrative as well as moral complexity of this recent, so-called quality trend of American drama television series, and the emerging genre convention of the antihero. The module also addresses how various types of television series have been valued in critical reception through the history of television. For example, in relation to the case studies mentioned above, the module may examine critically the implications of the oft-used label Quality TV and the HBO slogan Its not TV, its HBO. In addition to introducing the students to current developments in television studies, this module takes a film theoretical, narratological approach to current television series, and trains students in various approaches to the study of television series in and beyond television studies proper.

      FI623 - Beyond Cinema

      
      
       From the intimate viewing experience offered by mobile phones to the social interaction required by sing-a-long screenings, this module considers the changing nature of where, when and how audiences engage with film and the moving image. It considers the history of cinema-going, paying attention to the old and new sites of exhibition, especially those facilitated by new technologies. Connectedly, the module analyses the different modes of spectatorship, including audience participation and the desire to prolong or enhance the cinematic experience via extra-filmic activities, such as film-tourism. It also considers films interaction with other arts and mediafor example, its use within theatrical performances and its relationship with television. In doing so, this module reflects upon and reconsiders the definitions and limits of cinema and addresses the implications this has for the academic discipline Film Studies.

      FI626 - Mobile Filmmaking

      
      
       Mobile filmmaking has fast become a cultural phenomenon that democratises film production and generates new audio-visual aesthetics. It has also triggered the establishment of festivals designed specifically to showcase films made on mobile devices. Consequently, mobile filmmaking is now an object of serious academic study.  This module embraces mobile filmmaking in all these respects and encourages students to explore this accessible form of filmmaking with creative and critical rigour. Students will work either individually or in pairs to create a short fiction or documentary film on a mobile device. Alternatively, students can form a larger group to devise a web series for which each student makes an episode. Practical work will be contextualised in an essay that situates the student project in the field of mobile media. To facilitate this, lectures and screenings will explore narrative, experimental and documentary forms of mobile filmmaking in a way that encourages students to critically engage with issues of form and style germane to mobile digital media, the relationship between technology and creativity, as well as current and emerging platforms for the dissemination of creative work made on mobile devices.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

       Cinema has typically been conceived of as an essentially visual phenomenon  films, it is often said, are essentially moving pictures. Sound has, nevertheless, played an important role from the beginnings of cinema, a fact which has been acknowledged in the detailed historical, theoretical and critical work on film music, and film sound more generally, produced over the last decade. Sound and Cinema will provide an overview of this new field of research, and aim to provide students with a clearer understanding of and greater sensitivity to the soundtrack. The course will begin by setting up an introductory framework for the understanding of sound, which considers the relationship between music and other aspects of film sound (dialogue, voice-over, effects), as well as the nature of the relationship between image and sound.

      FI501 - Documentary Cinema

      
      
       This module addresses a series of documentary films in their historical context and in relation to the different modes of non-fiction filmmaking. Documentary narrative techniques including the use of archival footage, staged reconstructions of past events, and talking-head interviews, are investigated by means of close textual analysis and through a comparative approach to diverse documentary films. This module also explores the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction and, while articulating a definition of documentary film, it studies film forms that present an interplay between the two, such as Mockumentaries and Essay Films.

      FI527 - Storytelling and the Cinema

      
      
       This module examines different forms of narrative and story-telling in cinema, drawing upon theories of myth, folk and fairytale as well as upon anthropological studies of oral storytelling in order to place film narration within the tradition of the popular arts. The psychological and aesthetic role of narrative will be explored through the accounts offered by philosophy and psychoanalysis in order to understand the relations and tensions between narrative realism based on Aristotelian notions of cause and effect as well as character verisimilitude, and popular and avant-garde modes which transgress such notions.  The role played by, for example, film genres and the star system in disrupting or supporting narrative cause and effect will be considered.   The function of the script and of script-writing will be looked at in relation to the deployment of the cinematic elements of sound and image, spectacle and event in film.  The course will be taught through a series of case-studies using a wide range of films within American and world cinema.

      FI622 - Television Series: Narration, Engagement and Evaluation

      
      
       The module explores storytelling in fictional television series, and how the long duration of these series changes the spectators engagement, as compared to engagement in the relatively short fiction film. Furthermore, this module focuses on case studies in order to investigate their narrative, stylistic and thematic characteristics, their specific genre conventions and their background in television history. Case studies may include The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Madmen in an inquiry into the narrative as well as moral complexity of this recent, so-called quality trend of American drama television series, and the emerging genre convention of the antihero. The module also addresses how various types of television series have been valued in critical reception through the history of television. For example, in relation to the case studies mentioned above, the module may examine critically the implications of the oft-used label Quality TV and the HBO slogan Its not TV, its HBO. In addition to introducing the students to current developments in television studies, this module takes a film theoretical, narratological approach to current television series, and trains students in various approaches to the study of television series in and beyond television studies proper. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI617 - British Cinema

      
      
       In a country with a very strong literary and theatrical tradition, the British have also had a long-standing love of "going to the pictures."  For more than a century, British filmmakers have been forging a rich and diverse national cinema in the face of Hollywoods dominance on British screens for most of that time.  This course will offer an introductory historical overview of British cinema from its beginnings to the present day, assessing its role in the construction of British national identity, evaluating its major directorsincluding Humphrey Jennings, Ken Loach and Sally Potter.  The films will be approached through multiple frameworks, including consideration of aesthetics (e.g. realism), culture (e.g. gender and class), and history (e.g. the legacy of colonialism).  The institution of cinema and film culture in a larger sense will be considered through the exploration of British film exhibition, criticism, cultural policy, and industry.  Both fiction films and documentaries will be discussed.

      FI608 - Film Authorship

      
      
       This module will offer students the rare opportunity to examine in detail the work of a single director or a group of directors. It will thus enable students to acquire a more complex understanding of the issues at stake in the production, distribution, and reception of a specific body of film work. The module will also develop students knowledge and understanding of the questions, theories and controversies, which have informed critical issues and theoretical debates on film authorship. It will thus appeal to students who wish to extend their skills in analysing film form, meaning, and practice in both a conceptual and a historical context. Furthermore, as the module will enable detailed consideration of what film directing is, as an artistic and cultural practice, in given contexts, it will be a very useful course to combine with the practical study of filmmaking.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      FI624 - Beyond Cinema

      
      
       From the intimate viewing experience offered by mobile phones to the social interaction required by sing-a-long screenings, this module considers the changing nature of where, when and how audiences engage with film and the moving image. It considers the history of cinema-going, paying attention to the old and new sites of exhibition, especially those facilitated by new technologies. Connectedly, the module analyses the different modes of spectatorship, including audience participation and the desire to prolong or enhance the cinematic experience via extra-filmic activities, such as film-tourism. It also considers films interaction with other arts and mediafor example, its use within theatrical performances and its relationship with television. In doing so, this module reflects upon and reconsiders the definitions and limits of cinema and addresses the implications this has for the academic discipline Film Studies.
