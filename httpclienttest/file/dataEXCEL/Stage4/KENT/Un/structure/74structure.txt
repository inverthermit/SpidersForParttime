Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PL302 - Introduction to Philosophy: Knowledge and Metaphysics

      
      
       Can I know that I am not dreaming? Am I the same person I was when I was ten years old? Do I have an immaterial mind or immortal soul? Am I a mere machine or do I have a free will? What are the fundamental properties of the world? Does God exist? This module is meant to be an introduction to these and other fundamental problems of philosophy. The module begins with an examination of some themes in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, and moves on to discuss the arguments of other classical philosophers, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and also of contemporary thinkers. Among the themes addressed are: the nature of knowledge, scepticism, personal identity, the mind-body problem, free will and determinism, primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, God. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL303 - Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics

      
      
       Students studying on this module will be introduced to a number of big questions in ethics. The questions may include the following: What makes a life good? Is it happiness? Or is it something else? Another big question is: What makes actions right or wrong? Is it God demanding or forbidding them? Or are actions perhaps right to the extent that they serve to make lives better off, and wrong to the extent that they make lives worse off? Some philosophers have thought so. Others wonder: What if I steal money from someone so rich that my act in no way makes her life go any worse. Might it still be the case that I have acted wronglyeven if I haven't made anyone worse off? A third bit question is this: Whats the status of morality? Is it, for example, the case that whats right for me might be wrong for you? Does it make any sense at all to talk about moral claims being true or false, even relative to moral communities? Might moral judgments be nothing but expressions of sentiments? Throughout the course, students will be examining these and similar questions from the point of view of a variety of philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL310 - Introduction to Philosopy: Logic and Reasoning

      
      
       Since Platos Dialogues, it has been part of philosophical enquiry to consider philosophical questions using logic and common sense alone.  This module aims to train students to continue in that tradition.  In the first part students will be introduced to basic themes in introductory logic and critical thinking.  In the second part students will be presented with a problem each week in the form of a short argument, question, or philosophical puzzle and will be asked to think about it without consulting the literature.  The problem, and students responses to it, will then form the basis of a structured discussion.  By the end of the module, students (a) will have acquired a basic logical vocabulary and techniques for the evaluation of arguments; (b) will have practised applying these techniques to selected philosophical topics; and (c) will have acquired the ability to look at new claims or problems and to apply their newly acquired argumentative and critical skills in order to generate philosophical discussions of them.It will be taught through a combination of lectures and seminars in the first half of the term, and seminars only in the second half of the term.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL315 - Philosophical Reading and Writing (core)

      
      
       What do philosophers do?  How do they think?  What do they typically think about?  How do philosophers write?  What sorts of writing are acceptable in philosophy?  How should you write?  How should philosophy best be read in order to be understood and assessed? In this module we will introduce you to some of the most interesting questions in philosophy, both from its history and from current debates.  As we do this we will show you how to think, read and write as a philosopher.   Some of the questions we will discuss this year include: Why is Humes fork so important in the history of philosophy?, What is the difference between evaluative and descriptive judgements in aesthetics? and What is the difference between is and ought?  We will also think about questions of more general philosophical import, such as: What it is to presuppose something?, What is it to argue in a vicious circle?, and What does a philosophical definition look like?

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      EN333 - Romanticism

      
      
       This year-long course examines some of the most significant writing of the Romantic period (1780-1830) - a period in which the role and forms of literature were being redefined - alongside recent debates in critical theory. You will study a wide range of literary texts from the poetry of Blake, Wordsworth and Keats to the novels of Jane Austen and Mary Shelley, with reference to contemporary literary and political debates and against the backdrop of the periods turbulent history. In parallel, this module explores fundamental critical questions about literature: Why read it? What is an author? What is the role of poetry in society? How is literature shaped by culture? What is Art? Continuities and disjunctions between Romantic writers answers to these questions and those provided by more recent literary theorists will be a central concern of the course.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN331 - Readings in the Twentieth Century

      
      
       This module emphasizes the links between literature, history, and culture. It introduces students to the formative events, debates and struggles of the twentieth century, and how these have been addressed by different modes of creative and critical writing. Topics such as the First World War, Modernism, the Holocaust, the US culture industry, postcolonial studies, as well as 9/11, will be considered and discussed in relation to fictional and critical literature, films, photography, graphic novels, music, and other media. Weekly screenings will run alongside lectures and seminar discussions. Literary works across all genres will be read in relation to visual material  such as paintings, photography, various feature and documentary films, etc  and a range of selected critical reading. The majority of writing samples are drawn from English, American and more broadly anglophone writing, though several instances of writing in other languages will also be included (all taught in translation).

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN332 - Writing America

      
      
       This module aims to emphasize connections between literature and culture in the USA, from early considerations of a distinct American literature to the present day. By way of six key themes or preoccupations, the module will introduce students to some of the major debates and antagonisms, and rhetorical and stylistic modes, that have formed and modified American literary and intellectual culture Questions of Belief, Gender, Race, Economy, Space, and Time will be approached through a range of textual forms set against their historical contexts and within the broader nexus of cultural production including the visual performing arts where appropriate. Students will be encouraged to examine the specific local, regional, and national frameworks within which these texts are produced, but also to look at the ways in which they resist and transcend national boundaries, in the development of an American register in world literatures for instance. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN302 - Early Drama

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of medieval and early modern dramatic genres, from ninth-century Latin church drama to the commercial theatres of Shakespeare's London. Students will learn about methods for analysing past performances and existing texts, as well as how drama interacted with and responded to pivotal moments in British history, and the culture, politics and religion of the period.  As such, the module will function as an introduction to medieval and early modern studies more broadly and a platform from which to undertake early English literature and drama modules, such as Chaucer and Late Medieval Literature, Early Modern Literature, 1500-1700 and Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama, at Stages 2 and 3.  Students will read and discuss playtexts in modern translations, both as literary objects and live performance events. Regular optional site visits and screenings will contribute to students understanding of the dramas contexts, how plays might work in performance and to what extent they still speak to twenty-first century audiences. Lectures and seminars are designed to be varied and interactive, with the opportunity for everyone to participate and to develop key academic skills. The module is assessed by seminar contributions, creative and research-based coursework and a final end-of-year project, which will allow students the freedom to explore a topic of their choice creatively.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      EN681 - Novelty, Enlightenment and Emancipation: 18th Century Literature

      
      
       Before 1660 there was no English novel, and by the end of the eighteenth century there was Jane Austen. This module asks how such a literary revolution was possible. It investigates the rise of professional authorship in an increasingly open marketplace for books. With commercial expansion came experiment and novelty. Genres unheard of in the Renaissance emerged for the first time: they include the periodical essay, autobiography, the oriental tale, amatory fiction, slave narratives and, most remarkably, the modern novel. Ancient modes such as satire, pastoral and romance underwent surprising transformations. Many eighteenth-century men and women felt that they lived in an age of reason and emancipation  although others warned of enlightenments darker aspect. Seminar reading reflects the fact that an increasing number of women, members of the labouring classes, and African slaves wrote for publication; that readers themselves became more socially varied; and that Britain was growing to understand itself as an imperial nation within a shifting global context. It asks students to reflect, as eighteenth-century writers did, upon the literary, cultural and political implications of these developments

      EN692 - Early Modern Literature 1500-1700

      
      
       This module offers a survey of early modern literature from 1500 to 1700. Looking at a wide range of literature including poetry, prose and drama, students will consider the relationship between literary debate and form on the one hand, and political change, social identity and religious transformation on the other. We will consider how important debates surrounding political, social, gender and religious identity inflect and are reflected in the literature of the period, including works by Baldwin, Donne, Lanyer, Marvell, Milton and Behn. Students will also explore the boundaries of the literary canon, encountering pamphlets, sermons and conduct books, and consider the ways in which literary and non-literary texts both mirror and influence culture and society.

      EN694 - Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama

      
      
       The drama of early modern England broke new literary and dramatic ground. This module will focus on key plays across the period, exploring the development of dramatic writing, playing companies home within the London theatres, dramas links to court entertainment and its relationship to the provinces. Dramatic and literary form will be a central preoccupation alongside issues of characterisation, culture, politics and gender. Shakespeares work will be put into context in relation to the plays of contemporary dramatists as well as the various cultural, historical and material circumstances that influenced the composition, performance and publication of drama in early modern England.

      EN697 - Chaucer and Late Medieval English Literature

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of writing from the late medieval period.  It will focus on a number of central genres in English literature that emerge between the late fourteenth and early sixteenth centuries (from romance, tragedy and fabliaux through to morality plays and devotional prose) and will explore some key topics and themes in medieval literature, such as authority, gender, sexuality, piety, chivalric identity, narrative and voice, truth and destiny.  Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales will offer an accessible introduction to these core genres and themes, and initiate students in issues that are pertinent to less familiar writers and texts from the period, such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Malorys Le Morte Darthur, and The Book of Margery Kempe.  During the course of the module you will also learn about the historical and cultural contexts of the fourteenth, fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and how such contexts influenced the literature of the period.The themes and theories covered by the course will vary in response to the lecture programme and the emphasis and research specialisms of individual teachers.  Previous topics have included: gender and sexuality; authorship and patronage; history of the book; manuscripts and the printed texts; piety and devotion; iconography; social relations; performance cultures; audience, reading and reception; the body, corporeality and experience.

      EN689 - Modernism

      
      
       This module features key modernist texts, for example the work of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D., Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys. It also makes substantial reference to key philosophical theories of modernity and textuality. The literary works are taken mostly from a restricted period 1910-1939. Other texts which might form part of the curriculum may include a limited selection of works by F.T. Marinetti, Mina Loy, D.H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Samuel Beckett, Mikhail Bakhtin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Derrida. One focus in the module will be the notion of the artist as applied to the writer as an art-practitioner. Other topics include modes of representation, textuality and identity, the relationship between language and experience, war and democracy, class and politics, notions of exile, cosmopolitanism and bohemianism, sex, morality and city life. This material requires both theoretical and historical orientation, as well as skill in distilling significance from complex literary artefacts with regard to the network of mediations which both bind such works to their apparent context and appear to dislocate them.

      EN695 - Empire, New Nations and Migration

      
      
       This course will introduce students to the field of postcolonial literature, focusing on the period from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The course will be divided into three consecutive areas: empire and colonisation; the processes of decolonisation; and migration and diaspora. Centred primarily on canonical British colonial texts, the first part of the course will explore issues surrounding language, cosmopolitan encounters, Orientalism, modernism and the genres of imperial fantasy. The texts in the second part of the module will be drawn from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. The intention is to allow students to bring these disparate regions and texts into a productive dialogue by reflecting on their common engagement with colonial and liberation discourses, as well as the legacies of partition. The course further aims to sketch a narrative of empire and decolonisation that links these issues to the context of narrating migration in our contemporary postcolonial world, a subject taken up more directly in the final part of the course.Some brief extracts from critical material on colonial discourse and history, decolonisation, postcoloniality and migration will be considered alongside the primary text each week. Together with a broad primary textual arc that stretches from the British empire to the contemporary metropolis, the course will give students a coherent intellectual narrative with which to explore changing conceptions of culture, history and postcolonial identity across the modern world.

      EN677 - The Contemporary

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of contemporary literature written in English, where contemporary is taken to refer to twenty-first century work. It will equip students with critical ideas and theoretical concepts that will help them to understand the literature of their own time. Students will consider examples of a range of genres: poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction and the essay. They will also be selectively introduced to key ideas in contemporary theory and philosophy. Over the course of the module, students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts. They will consider writers responses to, for instance, questions of migration, environmental change, and financial crisis. They will also consider a range of aesthetic developments and departures, for example: new conceptualism and the claim to unoriginality; the turn to creative non-fiction; the re-emergence of the political essay. The module will not focus on a given national context. Instead it will set contemporary writing against the background of identifiably international issues and concerns. In so doing it will draw attention to non-national publishing strategies and audiences. Overall, the module will aim to show how writers are responding to the present period, how their work illuminates and reflects current cultural concerns. The module will alternate, week by week, between thematic and formal concerns.

      EN672 - Reading Victorian Literature

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of Victorian literature. It will equip students with critical ideas that will help them become more skilful and confident readers of texts in and beyond this period. Students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts: environmental (for example, considering the effects of urbanisation and the Industrial Revolution); imaginative (examining a range of genres such as poetry, novel, short story); political (class conflicts, changing gender roles, ideas of nation and empire); and psychological (representations of sexuality, parent-child relationships, madness, dreams). Students will be made aware of concepts such as modernity and will be encouraged to think about various developments of literary form in the period.

      EN675 - Declaring Independence: 19th Century US Literature

      
      
       When the Long Island-born poet Walt Whitman proclaimed in 1855 that the United States were historys greatest poem he made an important connection between national political culture and literary expression. In some ways this was no exaggeration. As a new experiment in politics and culture, the United States had to be literally written into existence. Beginning with Thomas Jeffersons dramatic Declaration of Independence in 1776, followed by the drafting of the Constitution after the Revolutionary War with Britain, the project of shaping the new United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was essentially a literary one.  In this module we will explore how American writers in this period tried in numerous, diverse ways to locate an original literary voice through which to express their newfound independence. At the same time, the module includes the work of writers who had legitimate grievances against the developing character of a new nation that still saw fit to cling to such Old World traditions as racialized slavery, class conflict and gender inequality.

      PL584 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL585 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL596 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL602 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      PL604 - Advanced Topics in Mind and Langauge

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval.The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

      PL605 - Logic

      
      
       What makes a good argument? How can we tell whether an argument is valid? Logic aims to provide answers to questions such as these. In this module we shall discuss arguments and argument structure; notions such as validity, soundness and consistency; and procedures for testing the validity of arguments in both propositional and predicate logic.

      PL606 - Philosophy of Science

      
      
       The module will study some of the major works in the history of modern philosophy of science. Texts to be studied will be drawn from a list which includes major works by philosophers such as Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, Salmon, etc. The approach will be philosophical and critical, and will involve the close reading of texts. Students will be expected to engage critically with the works being studied and to formulate and argue for their own views on the issues covered. Themes to be studied will include: the nature of scientific theory change, the status of scientific claims, the methodology of scientific reasoning, the prospects for automating scientific reasoning. The course will cover a range of topics such as:Inductivism versus falsificationismResearch ProgrammesIncommensurabilityRealismInstrumentalismProbabilistic ReasoningCausal ReasoningMathematical ReasoningConfirmationExplanation

      PL610 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art?  What is an artwork?  Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common?  If so, what are they?  Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided?  Do avant-garde works count as art?  Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention?  What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally?  These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course.  After that we will consider other issues and questions.  What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities?  What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way?  Why is rock music such a part of our lives?  Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery?  What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art?  Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters?  Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code?  And what on earth is the point of public art?  What is public art?

      PL628 - Continental Philosophy: Subject, Identity and the Political

      
      
       The curriculum is intended to introduce students to some of the key arguments and debates in contemporary continental political philosophy through the focussed reading and discussion of the works of a number of central thinkers (Charles Taylor, Iris Marion Young, Foucualt, Derrida, Butler) in this field. It is also the aim of this module to consider the works and ideas of philosophers that are often overlooked on undergraduate political philosophy courses e.g. feminist thinkers and Queer theorists.The curriculum should not be regarded as written in stone but responsive to new publications and developments in this field of research and to events in the wider world.

      PL640 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL638 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations.   They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology.  Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel.  However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes.  In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist.  An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students.  However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand.  This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight.    The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers.  Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full.  These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

      PL625 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      PL642 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

       Is it right that the talented profit from their (undeserved) talents? Should the government provide compensation for people who find it hard to meet that special someone? Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses.

      EN676 - Cross-Cultural Coming-of-Age Narratives

      
      
       If the Bildungsroman has been criticised for being outmoded and conservative, how do contemporary writers interrogate and expand its scope and importance? Are coming-of-age narratives merely private stories or can they be read in ways which highlight their social functions, and what kind of theoretical, aesthetic and cultural perspectives can we apply to scrutinise these functions? This module will bring together a range of texts and films from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that can be read within and against the literary tradition of the Bildungsroman or the coming-of-age narrative. Drawing on material from the US, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe, we will spend time analysing the representation of the coming-of-age experience in terms of content and form and assess the ideological functions of the Bildungsroman in a cross-cultural context. Particular attention will be given to questions of racial and ethnic identity, migration, colonialism, memory, trauma, belonging and sexuality. We will also explore the connection of the Bildungsroman with genres such as autobiography, memoir, young adult fiction, travel narrative, graphic novel, and film.

      EN669 - Marriage, Desire and Divorce in Early Modern Literature

      
      
       This module focuses on the theory and practice of marriage and divorce in early modern England and its treatment in the literature of the period. Examining a wide range of texts (drama, poetry, prose works and domestic handbooks alongside documentary sources such as wills, legal records and letters), it will explore the ways in which representations of marriage and its breakdown both reflected and informed the roles of men and women in early modern society. The relationships between discourses about gender, politics and the historical evidence about men and women's married lives in the period will be explored both through reading in the extensive secondary literature of gender, women's history and masculinity as well as through the study of primary sources such as wills, court records, advice books, popular literature (ballads and pamphlets, for example), literary texts (poems, plays and tracts), diaries and personal memoirs and material objects such as wedding rings and scolds bridles, for example. From Shakespeare and Fletcher's dramas of happy and unhappy marriage and Spenser's poetry of marital bliss,  to argument surrounding men and women's roles in marriage in the poetry and pamphlets of Milton and his contemporaries, we will also go in search of the personal accounts of women and men's experiences of marriage and its breakdown and the material artefacts which are testament to them.

      EN670 - Lyric, Ballad and Popular Song

      
      
       This course looks at how British and American popular song has been collected and transformed by literary professionals (particularly poets and academics) from the eighteenth century to the present day. The focus of the module is on poetry that has its origins in vernacular traditions of ballad singing, but its purview takes in all sorts of writings that are apt to be sung, or that have the vocal/lyrical medium as a significant element of their textual identity. The course is structured as a historical survey, tracing succeeding attempts by collectors, academics, poets and singers to preserve and to adapt such songs. It progresses from eighteenth-century and romantic-period ballad collectors such as Thomas Percy and Walter Scott, through revivalists such as Francis James Child, Lady Gregory, Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp, to contemporary popular musicians who draw on oral sources, such as Bob Dylan and P.J. Harvey. Students will be encouraged to consider how the figure of the singer and the act of singing have been used by poets (Gray, McPherson, Wordsworth, Dickinson, Hardy, Yeats, Gurney, Auden, Bishop) in figurative representations both of the inherited component of literary culture, and of the sublime (or otherwise ineffable) component of their particular art, poetry. Through discussions of theoretical texts students will be encouraged to consider the contrasting functions of poetic language from the perspectives of speech, lyric, narrative and vocalized song. The broad aims of the course are to help students find a critical idiom through which to describe the textual interdependence of inscribed, vocalized and musical articulations; to trace historical changes in that relationship; and to understand the ideological contexts of those changes in succeeding ages of nation-building, of empire, of world war, and of globalization.

      EN659 - Contemporary Irish Writing

      
      
       This module will consider a broad variety of Irish writing from about the 1970s to the present, sampling significant developments in poetry, drama and prose. Seminar discussion will focus on recurrent issues addressed in the texts selected for study, such as history, cultural memory, violence and society, queer sexualities and gender relations, national and cultural identities, and the negotiation of what the historian Roy Foster has called the varieties of Irishness.

      EN660 - Writing Lives in Early Modern England: Diaries, Letters and Secret Selv

      
      
       Who wrote about their lives while Shakespeare was writing his plays and Queen Elizabeth was on the throne? Why did they do it, how and by whom did they intend their writing to be read, and what sort of things did they think were interesting about their lives? This module introduces you to the variety of sources available for exploring early modern life writing. Studying better- against less well-known texts (e.g. Anne Cliffords Diary and Shakespeares plays; early modern wills, letters and recipe books), and literary works alongside more pragmatic writings, the module will offer you an opportunity to investigate the private thoughts of the men and women of this crucial period of English history. Writing Lives is for anyone who has ever thought, even briefly, about keeping a diary  it encourages you to consider big questions like the nature of writing; the status of individuality; the forms which identity might take; but also stranger questions such as how the way you wrote a letter might have related to Hamlets To be or not to be speech.

       This module takes the figure of the stranger as a starting point for exploring the different ideas and contexts of belonging that have shaped the novel over the last century.  Contexts will include modernity and the Holocaust, race and gender in modern America, and contemporary fictions of exile and encounter.  Among the writers considered will be Joseph Conrad, Toni Morrison, and J M Coetzee.  The course will also draw on a variety of twentieth-century cultural, social and psychological conceptions of belonging, from the work of Sigmund Freud through to the more recent ideas of Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and Zygmunt Bauman.

       This module will trace the development of Chaucers literary reputation from his own attempts to forge an authorial legacy to his posthumous instantiation as The Father of English Poetry.  Some of the works of a generation of fifteenth-century followers who addressed Chaucer as a pioneer in vernacular poetry will be read alongside their adaptations of Chaucerian texts and literary techniques. The module will also explore the Chaucerian apocrypha, and assess what these additions to Chaucers literary corpus tell us about the authors fifteenth-century reception. The module will go on to follow some of the history of Chaucer in print, before assessing more modern appropriations of Chaucer in cinema, television and online media.

      EN667 - Harlem to Hogan's Alley: Black Writing in North America

      
      
       This module will bring together works of poetry and fiction by a number of black writers in the USA and Canada in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With a particular emphasis on migration, music, and urban space, we will explore the intellectual, political, and aesthetic imperatives that drive these writers to address questions of race, ethnicity, gender, belonging, representation, poverty, privilege, and trauma. Beginning in Harlem in the 1920s, the moment when the Negro was in vogue, students will examine the ways in which black Americans and Canadians have sought to make their impact on the literary landscape, by turns exposing and employing the power structures of the dominant culture. This comparative look at US and Canadian literatures, however, also challenges students to scrutinize the construction of literary and other categories, and to consider the commonality and distinctive difference between black experience north and south of the 49th parallel. Lectures/workshops will emphasise discussion of key moments and movements in African American / African Canadian arts; the significance of linguistic distinctiveness; the cultural self-categorisation of black, African American, Africadian and Halfrican identities; and the rise of African American literary theory.

      EN668 - Discovery Space: New Theatres in Early Modern England

      
      
       This module introduces students to the drama of Shakespeare's time, thinking in particular about the new theatrical buildings and the discoveries they made possible. The module encourages independent study and is consequently built around student interests as they develop their own research questions and essay topic.This period saw the emergence of the first permanent purpose built playhouses, and the development of the theatre industry.  We will consider how the conditions of performance and production  such as playhouse architecture, the reportorial system, printing, censorship and Londons changing urban environment  affected playwrights, actors and audiences. Reading a range of playwrights, students will get a sense of the main trends which shaped the drama of the time, contextualising their understanding of canonical writers such as Shakespeare. Students will also engage with the current developments in early modern theatre history and the ways in which thinking about authorship, staging, printing and other key concepts from the period has altered over the last fifty years. As part of this work, we will examine the phenomena of modern reconstructed playhouses such as Shakespeares Globe, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse and the American Shakespeare Centres Blackfriars, asking what - if anything - modern performance in these spaces can tell us about early modern practices.Office hours will support students in their independent work towards a long essay, whilst weekly two hour seminars will emphasise key moments in the period which will inform the individual interests of all students. Alongside the weekly seminar, the third hour of teaching will be used for workshops, screenings, directed reading/research group meetings and field tips.

      EN684 - Clouds, Waves & Crows: Writing the Natural, 1800 to the Present

      
      
       This module will look at a variety of texts, in a variety of forms, from the early nineteenth century to the present.  The poems, essays, novels, films, paintings and autobiographies all engage with and question our relationship to the world around us.  They sometimes look at nature, but more often ask what it is, what do we use it for, what is our relationship to it, what does it mean for us, what do we make it mean and to what ends, or what is the role that language plays in creating or representing our role in the world? Moreover, while nature may be seen to be something out there the module seeks to ask how it is connected to our understanding of identity, history, or sexuality.The module is not arranged around primary creative texts, and their theoretical accompaniments, but has a more ecological approach to the idea of the creative/critical boundary which means that some weeks core texts may be theoretical ones (such as John Grays Straw Dogs).  This approach is reflected in the modes of assessment where students are invited to produce either two essays, or one traditionally critical one, and one work of creative non-fiction that may encompass aspects of memoir, poetry, psychogeography or philosophy.

       Poetry and Crisis will tell a history of twentieth-century poetry through the lens of the major political events that have shaped it. Addressing key social issues including economic crisis, class, nation, war and postcolonialism, the module will investigate both key figures in the history of mainstream poetic tradition (W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Derek Walcott) and more experimental and collaborative movements such as proletarian realism, Language Poetry and art associated with the Occupy movement. Within these traditions, students will explore the possible ways in which poetry can be said to articulate, respond to and intervene in political crisis.

       The module focuses on the literary production of North Americas indigenous peoples, drawing on the historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts of one tribe, the Anishinaabeg, or Ojibwe. Students will be encouraged to explore aesthetic and intellectual developments in Native literature and theory; to examine the nature of indigenous status in relation to both North America and the wider world; and to draw on their understanding of canonical literature and literary theory to isolate points of intersection and divergence between Native American and American literatures. We will cover a wide range of literary forms, from transcriptions of oral traditions, through autobiography, to the postmodern novel; and scrutinize and employ a number of strategies of reading the unfamiliar, from ethnological discourse to tribal literary nationalism.The relationship between Native American literature and art will be a key feature of lecture/workshop discussion and, where appropriate, film screenings will be offered.

      EN633 - Bodies of Evidence: Reading The Body In Eighteenth Century Literature

      
      
       This module explores the eighteenth-century fascination with bodies and the truths (or lies) bodies were supposed to reveal. The course focuses on the ways in which the body is read and constructed in eighteenth-century literature and how these readings and constructions reflect various concerns about class, race, gender and sexuality. Through the course of this module we will examine a range of literary representations of the body which seek both to control the body and to celebrate its destructive potential. We will read texts from a variety of genres, including medical literature, misogynist satire, sentimental novels, popular fiction, travel writing and pornography alongside recent critical work by Thomas Lacqueur, Michel Foucault, Roy Porter, Stallybrass and White, which illuminate the ideological stakes writers played for when writing about the body. Topics for discussion will include disability and deformity, race, the sentimental body, dress and the body, the body as a text and the relationship between the body and the body politic. The primary focus of this option will be literature, but we will also examine visual representations of the body in caricature and satire as well as in the portraiture.

      EN637 - Unruly Women and Other Insubordinates: the dramatic repertoire of the Q

      
      
       Unruly Women & Other Insubordinates:   The Dramatic Repertoire of the Queen Anna's Men (1604-1625) The Jacobean period is renowned for producing some of the most incisive, inventive, and interrogative drama in the English language --  plays which both delve into the darker corners of human experience (lust, temptation, sin, revenge) and affirm positive values for humanity (love, compassion, tolerance).  In this challenging module we will study a selection of plays in the context of the dramatic company that performed them,  Queen Annas Men.  In so doing we will engage with immediate contexts of dramatic production in the period: the organisation, work, and role of the dramatic company; the impact of playhouses and their audiences; the often collaborative nature of playwriting (particularly the work of Thomas Heywood, but also that of  John Day, Thomas Dekker, William Rowley and  John Webster).  We will also pay attention to the literary qualities of these plays, especially their complexities of genre (comedy, tragedy, tragi-comedy) and subtleties of language.  Combining literary analysis with an attention to the specific work of one dramatic company, this module offers an innovative approach to Jacobean drama that enables reach fresh readings of both familiar and neglected plays in the period.

      EN646 - Image, Vision and Dream: Medieval Texts and  Visual Culture

      
      
       This module explores the complex relationships between written and visual culture, the latter including both artefacts such as paintings and sculpture, and the products of visual imagination such as dreams and visions.  We will ask questions such as: Can images really be innocent representations, or are they always replete with social, political and ideological significations?  In what ways might we 'read' images in order to recover those significations?  Where text and images appear together, is the relationship between them hierarchical, or are other kinds of relationship possible?  How might we blur the boundaries between text and image, for example in the case of narrative images, or descriptive and imagistic texts?  The rich textual and visual culture of the Middle Ages is used as a starting point, a lens through which you will have the opportunity to explore these questions from a range of angles, including the semiotic theories developed by Barthes as well as more traditional art-historical approaches.  We will explore texts from a variety of genres, including dream poetry and religious vision, alongside images in manuscripts, wall paintings, stained glass and sculpture.  The project element of the assessment offers you the opportunity to undertake independent research on any aspect of the module you choose (whether medieval or not); topics chosen in recent years have ranged from an exploration of meaning in medieval maps to a study of the iconography employed by Lady Gaga in videos and other publicity materials.

      EN655 - Places and Journeys

      
      
       This module explores what fascinates travellers and writers about both familiar and far-flung places. London, Istanbul, Cairo; roads, railways, and rivers; oceans, deserts, and deepest England: each place or mode of travel will be investigated as a source of inspiration, fantasy, and desire. How do invention and authenticity jostle for precedence in fictional as well as factual travel? Does travel writing reveal more about the places visited or the subjectivities of the writers? We will focus on modern writers with glances back to historical precursors. Writers studied should include Jack Kerouac, Orhan Pamuk, Iain Sinclair, Che Guevara, Paul Bowles, Gautam Malkani, Edward Said, Patrick Wright.

      EN656 - Heroes and Exiles: An Introduction to Old English Poetry

      
      
       In July 2009 a treasure-hunter unearthed the most significant hoard of Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever discovered in the British Isles: the Staffordshire Hoard.  The size and diversity of this treasure promises to reveal new insights into Anglo-Saxon life and culture.  But artefacts alone do not tell us everything; to get closer to the minds of those who made and used such items we need to recover the words of the Anglo-Saxons themselves, and this module, with its focus on the small but rich corpus of Old English Poetry, does exactly that.  This is a culture in which pagan and Christian ideals were melded together in ways quite unexpected to the modern mind.  We will discover a preoccupation with heroic deeds of warfare, and a desire to be remembered across the generations for feats of courage; we will also encounter a fear of being isolated from God, and the terrible sense of loss and longing of those who find themselves exiled from their lands and loved ones.  We will read a range of Old English poetry in modern English translations, setting it alongside manuscripts and images of artefacts to consider the ways in which the poetry both reflected and helped to shape Anglo-Saxon culture.  There will be the opportunity to engage at a very introductory level with the Old English language (no previous experience necessary), in order that we can explore the challenges of translating this complex and dazzling poetry into modern English.  The importance attached to the presentation element of assessment reflects the oral nature of Anglo-Saxon poetic culture.  Throughout the term you will receive help and advice on preparing for the presentation, and there will be opportunities to practise anad develop your presentations skills informally.

      EN657 - The Brontes in Context

      
      
       While the so-called Bront&euml; myth remains potent in popular culture today, the lives-and-works model associated with it continues to encourage readers to seek partially concealed Bront&euml; sisters in their fictions. Beginning and ending with the problematic of mythmaking  its origins in Gaskells 'Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;' and its subsequent perpetuation in film and other rewritings - this module will restore attention to the rich literary contribution made by the sisters through an intensive focus on their novels and selected poetry in the context of Victorian debates about gender and the woman question. Situating the Bront&euml;  myth in relation to other forms of mythmaking in the period (for example, ideologies of class, gender and empire), it will consider a small selection of film adaptations and go on to examine the Bront&euml;ss experiments with narrative voice and form, their variations upon the novel of education, the tensions between romance and realism in their writing and their engagement with religious and philosophical questions as well with the political, economic and social conditions of women in mid-Victorian culture. We will also consider a range of modern creative and critical engagements with the Bront&euml;s' literary works..

       This module explores the history and practice of crime fiction in the United States, from the detective stories of Edgar Allen Poe in the 1840s through the evolution of hardboiled narratives in the early and mid-twentieth century, and on into the 21st century novel. Attention is also paid to developments in film and television which parallel those in fiction, such as the birth of film noir and the contemporary cop series. During the course of the term, our readings of crime fiction will be supported by critical and theoretical texts by Franco Moretti, Tzvetan Todorov and others. Topics we will address include the relationship between high and low culture, how and why genres evolve, and the ways in which crime fiction addresses questions of race and gender

       London became a metropolis in the sixteenth century  it grew wildly in size and its big city status made it the entertainment capital of England. This module analyses the relationship between a developing city and an expanding cultural life in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. It considers the increase in playhouses, shopping, street life, religious life and public shaming. It explores the dynamics between urban life and writing  the way Londoners wrote about their city, the way satirists punctured its self-image, the way courts recorded its crimes and the way entertainment was scripted. It investigates the interplay between spontaneous popular culture and structured civic entertainment, and between court culture and prostitution. Topics to be covered include mapping the city: Stowes Survey; working London: street cries and the water poet; street performances: sermons and book burnings; women on the margins: cony catching and prostitution; and shopping in London: the new exchange and its plays.

       This module will examine the interactions between Britons and the world beyond Europe during the eighteenth century and the different sites of exchange and domination, as well as hybrid cultural articulations, that emerged from these interactions.  We will look at a variety of texts that depict non-European people and places, as well as texts that were read by Britons and written by foreign and colonial peoples, to assess critically the transnational and transatlantic understanding and influences of the period.  We will explore topics such as Cosmopolitanism in the Eighteenth Century, Foreign Influence on British Identity, The Material Culture of Empire, and Transatlantic Culture.  Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the postcolonial study of eighteenth-century literature and the ethical and political implications of these texts and the ways in which we choose to approach them.

      EN703 - The 'Real' America: Class and Culture in the American Gilded Age

      
      
       What is at stake when artists and writers decide to take the real world as the subject of their art? In the later nineteenth century, to depict reality in fiction and art became a radical act of social protest and critique. In an endeavour to locate the truth behind American society, realists moved well beyond pre-existing societal norms to investigate the squalid living conditions of immigrants in the New York slums, participate in Native American religious ceremonies, and probe the psychosexual neuroses of the middle classes. This module explores the American ideology of realism (Michael Elliot) in the late nineteenth- and early- twentieth centuries as expressed in a variety of forms and genres, including: the novel, painting, anthropology and photography. We will discuss the reasons behind the emergence of realism in the later nineteenth century, how it interacted with the new mass culture, whether it critiqued or reinforced dominant racial, sexual, ethnic and class-based prejudices, and, finally, why it declined in the twentieth century as the favoured aesthetic of the American avant-garde. On this module we will move far beyond seeing realism as merely a tame, neutral artistic style to investigate how it pointed to a radical way of seeing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century world. The module includes only 3 longer works (Wharton, Howells, and Mooney).

      EN704 - Discord and Devotion: Society & Spirituality in Middle English Literatu

      
      
       This module will introduce students to late-medieval models of social order and, against these official representations, explore how established concepts of identity and social status were debated, destabilized and renegotiated.  Through analysing texts such as William Langlands Piers Plowman, the letters of John Ball, Chaucers Canterbury Tales, selected lyrics and a variety of historiographical texts, the course will investigate the ways in which attempts to control social movement were challenged and contested.  In a period in which traditional feudal social structures were being supplanted by an emergent proto-capitalist economy, the lower orders were demanding a new political platform and English literature reveals both social aspirations and reactionary anxieties.In parallel with the political tumult, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries also saw a rise in non-official, heterodox forms of spirituality, licensing individual devotional practices that similarly challenged the perceived hegemony of the Church.  Investigating works of affective devotion, like The Book of Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwichs Revelations of Divine Love, and a variety of religious lyrics and plays, in addition to Wycliffite and Lollard sermons, the module will uncover the growing popularity of devotional forms predicated upon a personal relationship with and experience of the divine.  These practices (like their political counterparts) decentred spiritual authority and reveal a theological ambition which problematised orthodox religion in multiple ways.  Within these reimagined visions of social and religious structures are the seeds of new ideas that would shape the future of the English nation; in such visions the common man gains power and authority, women are empowered as spiritual leaders, and the authority of Church and State is subject to lay criticism and intervention.

      EN705 - The Contemporary Memoir

      
      
       Why is the memoir such a popular genre in contemporary literature? Are memoirs individualistic, sentimental and voyeuristic (what is often dismissed as misery literature) or can they have strong ethical impulses and powerful real-world effects? This course critically examines the significance of the memoir  a first-person account of a part of ones life, often written by someone not previously known as a writer in late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century literature. Through reading a range of recent memoirs we will examine the themes, techniques and debates that have come to characterise this genre. Drawing on a range of aesthetic, theoretical and cultural perspectives, we will approach these memoirs both as literature  as rich sources for critical analysis and capable of transforming academic criticism  and in terms of their appeal, and sometimes controversial reception, within present-day mass audiences.  We will also expand our discussion of memoirs to consider graphic narrative and film.

       The Love Poem will tell a history of English poetry through the lens of its most important and singular genre. Students will interrogate the characteristics of modern poetry itself through an investigation of love, desire, gender and intimacy as they have been articulated through the changing lyrical tradition of the language. The module will examine key canonical writers from the beginnings of the English lyric, including Thomas Wyatt and William Shakespeare, through complications in metaphysical poetry, the ballad and Romanticism, up to present day representations of homosexual love, popular song and avant-garde expression. Poets will be studied alongside theorists such as Alain Badiou, Roland Barthes and Henri Bergson, exploring the possible ways in which poetry can be said to challenge dominant modes of love, interact with their social environment through love poetry, and investigate, express and explain the experiences of attraction, attachment and loss.

       What is the relationship between animal and human, and how is this explored through writing? This module seeks to examine creaturely relations by focusing on literature from the 18th century up to the present, alongside key theoretical and contextual material that engages with questions concerning animality and humanity. We will focus on how writers imagine distinct animal worlds as well as how they understand the role of animals in human cultures. A range of novels, short stories and poems will raise questions about how we look at, think with, and try to give voice to animals, and topics covered will include Becoming Animal, Listening to Animals, Animal Experiments' and Tasting Animals. Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the diverse critical field known as animal studies, whilst also considering the broader cultural, philosophical and ethical implications  of how we think about the relationship between humans and animals.

      EN710 - Victorian Aestheticism and Decadence

      
      
       This module is an intensive study of aesthetic and decadent literature in late Victorian Britain. We will explore some of the key literary and critical works that popularised the concept of the 'aesthetic' and the ideal of the aesthetic life, and examine how and why 'art for art's sake' and 'decadence' came to be understood as the watchwords of a countercultural movement. The module also takes in along its way some of the manifestos, scandals, satires, and controversies that made aestheticism and decadence vivid in the public imagination, such as the 'Fleshly School of Poetry' controversy, the notorious periodical The Yellow Book, and the three trials of Oscar Wilde. This module pays particular attention to the relationship between the literary and visual arts, and aims to help students gain a sophisticated understanding of the intellectual and imaginative stakes of Victorian aestheticism and decadence, as well as of the social and material contexts from which a 'cult of beauty' arose in late Victorian Britain. We will consider the ways in which Aestheticism and Decadence look backward to Romanticism and forward to Modernism; how they became a means of imagining alternative sexualities, identities, and lifestyles; and how they clarify (or falsify) the relations between art, ethics, and politics.

Writers studied will include W B Yeats, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, A K Ramanujan and Lorna Goodison.  The aim of the course will be to evoke the complex relationship between local historical contexts, the effects of globalisation and the changing postcolonial aesthetics of their poetry.  Particular attention will be paid to the role of poetry in shaping, as well as questioning, national consciousness and in the articulation of concepts of individual, gendered and cultural autonomy.

       The module is structured around poetry and fiction produced in New York since the war.  The emphasis is primarily upon New York's experimental and avant-garde traditions, and one organising principle is the inter-connectedness of the arts in New York.

       The module examines some key texts in the theory and literary presentation of utopia. In the first part of the module we will examine classic early utopian texts (Plato, More) and will set these in the context of the modern theory of historical progress (Hegel) the failure of that progress to materialise (Agamben) and the nature of hope for the future (Bloch). In the second part of the module, we will examine modern classics which look at the failure of the communist utopia (Zamyatin, Huxley, Orwell) and at later texts which revived the genre of utopia (LeGuin, Atwood).

       This module explores the representation and performance of sin, vice and misbehaviour in drama, c. 1350-1550.  Students will examine a range of medieval and early Tudor dramatic modes, and will consider how ideas about vice and sin were conveyed through performance, how such presentations worked in conjunction with their virtuous and divine counterparts, the audiences own embodied experience and the potential problems inherent in the bodily pleasures of performance.  Via the study of vice and sin, students will also encounter core aspects of medieval and early Tudor performance culture, dramaturgy, and the material, social and religious conditions that informed drama in this period.  In addition, students will be introduced to a range of non-dramatic primary sources, such as the Records of Early English Drama, medieval philosophy and theology, iconography, spiritual and devotional manuals, and etiquette books, which will sit alongside the playtexts and inform our understanding of medieval concepts of vice.  Modern theories of embodiment, cognition, space, phenomenology and performance will underpin the study of vice on this module and students will be asked to assess the usefulness of these models as a way of critically engaging with medieval and early Tudor drama.

      EN716 - Marxism, Literature and Culture

      
      
       This module offers students a synoptic perspective on Marxist cultural criticism from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day in Europe, Russia and North America. It begins with an analysis of a selection from Marxs own writings, with the aim of introducing key terms, such as alienation, ideology, and dialectic. Students understanding of these terms and their critical uses for literary and cultural studies will develop during the course of the module, as they encounter a range of important Marxist thinkers and their writings. Throughout the module students will be invited to interrogate and transgress the boundaries separating literary from critical texts, and theory from practice. They will be invited to consider creative practice and Marxist criticism in dialogue with one another at particular historical moments. Although anchored in the literary and the textual, the module will also offer opportunities to think critically about the term culture itself in its broadest senses, encompassing a range of aesthetic and social practices, such as sport and music. Progressing through the great class conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Frankfurt School, New Left and anti-racist decolonization movements of the postwar period, up to the contemporary neoliberal moment, the module aims finally to offer students a set of tools with which to understand their own cultural encounters in the present as well as to reconfigure and re-evaluate the cultural knowledge they have accumulated in stages one and two of their degree programmes.

       This module focuses on the exploration of the graphic novel as a visual and literary medium. The module will interpret the term graphic novel broadly, and incorporate discussions of comic books, political cartoons, as well as film and television adaptations as a part of its curriculum. The module will begin with an examination of the more mature aesthetic that became increasingly popular for graphic novels during the late 1980s, and examine how these developments have continued to evolve to the present day. Strong emphasis will be placed on readings informed by sociological and political discourses. Students will be encouraged to relate their close analysis of texts to topics such as the distinctions between art and popular culture, and the connections between literary and social history, as well as contemporary concerns such as identity politics, neo-liberal capitalism, protest, and anarchy. As such, the module will demonstrate how the study of graphic novels directly relates to several key concerns in the study of undergraduate English.

      PL623 - Advanced Topics in Reasoning

      
      
       The module will cover some of the major topics of the theory of reasoning, with a focus on presenting students with new and exciting research. The syllabus will vary from year to year. The approach will be philosophical and critical, and may involve the close reading of texts. Students will be expected to engage critically with the works being studied and to formulate and argue for their own views on the issues covered. As an indication of the kind of topics covered, the following are three potential syllabi, one of which might operate in any particular year:1. Probability and probabilistic reasoning. This syllabus will present the major interpretations of probability and their connection with the various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. Topics covered might include: the classical interpretation; the logical interpretation; the subjective interpretation; the frequency interpretation; the propensity interpretation; the objective Bayesian interpretation. The key text will be D.A.Gillies (2000): Philosophical theories of probability, Routledge.2. Causality and causal reasoning. This syllabus will present the major theories of causality, including difference-making theories (probabilistic theories, counterfactual theories, agency theories), mechanistic theories (process theories, complex systems theories) and pluralist theories. It will go on to consider methods of causal reasoning in the sciences and the implications of such methods for the metaphysics of causality. In the absence of a comprehensive text, this syllabus will appeal to papers, especially those in the Oxford Handbook of Causation (OUP 2009), and Causality in the Sciences (OUP 2011).3. Invalid arguments. This syllabus will look in detail at methods of assessing the cogency of deductively invalid arguments. In particular it will present the methods of inductive logic for assessing the plausibility of arguments. It will provide an introduction to probabilistic logics and their semantics, as well as to methods of inference in probabilistic logics, with a focus on elementary methods that can be readily acquired by students with little prior training in logic and no prior knowledge of probability theory. In the absence of a text at a suitable level, this syllabus will be accompanied by a set of detailed lecture notes.Convenor: Jon WilliamsonJon Williamson works on various topics connected with reasoning, inference and scientific method, including causal reasoning in the sciences, inductive reasoning, and the nature of probability. The aim of this module is to introduce students to cutting-edge research on topics such as these. Jon is editor of the gazette The Reasoner, co-director of the Centre for Reasoning, and author of books on reasoning such as Bayesian nets and causality (OUP 2005), In defence of objective Bayesianism (OUP 2010) and Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks (Springer 2011).

       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses

Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

      PL643 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL624 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      PL639 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations. They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel. However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes. In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist. An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students. However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand. This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight. The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers. Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full. These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

      PL514 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL526 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art? What is an artwork? Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common? If so, what are they? Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided? Do avant-garde works count as art? Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention? What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally? These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course. After that we will consider other issues and questions. What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities? What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way? Why is rock music such a part of our lives? Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery? What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art? Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters? Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code? And what on earth is the point of public art? What is public art?

      PL527 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL641 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      TH619 - Religious Studies and Philosophy in the Classroom

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. This module is aimed at those students who would like to follow a career as Secondary School teachers, but is also suitable to those who would like to combine an academic course with work experience. Placements in a school environment will enhance the students employment opportunities as they will acquire a range of skills. It will also provide the students with the opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of Religious Education and Philosophy in the secondary school context. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other. The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school where each student will have a designated teacher-mentor who will guide their work in school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progress, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school.

      PL570 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL576 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.
