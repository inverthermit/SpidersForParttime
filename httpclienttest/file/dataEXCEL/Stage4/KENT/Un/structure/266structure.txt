 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SA300 - Social Problems and Social Policy I: Youth,The family and the State

      
      
       This module is designed both for students intending to specialise in social policy, and for other students who are interested in social problems and responses to them. We explore the ways in which phenomena come to be labelled as social problems, we focus upon the problem of youth and why certain youth behaviours are seen as problematic, who defines them as such and what is expected in terms of the balance between state and family responsibility.  Issues explored include: young peoples changing relationship to the family; teenage pregnancy; education, transitions to work, migration drug (mis)use, youth homelessness and anti-social behaviour.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SA301 - Health, Care and Wellbeing

      
      
       Health ,care and wellbeing are central concerns in all our lives; and they raise questions of the rival roles of the state, the market and the individual in their creation and support.  In this module we explore how we understand and conceptualise these areas, and the potential role of policy interventions in support of them.  The module examines the social determinants of health, exploring the ways in which these reduplicate wider inequalities in society.  It asks how we might best address changing health needs, particularly in relation to the growing proportion of older people, exploring these in the context of the new politics of the NHS.  What are the best structures to deliver health care? How that these best be funded?  Life style is increasingly implicated in health outcomes, and the module explores the dilemmas raised by rising levels of obesity and alcohol consumption. These are matters of personal choice, but they challenge the health and wellbeing of the population, and raise questions of how choices are shaped in the context of market production. Governments increasingly declare that they are interested not simply in health or prosperity, but also of wellbeing. The module explores what this means, and why is there a new interest in this on this area.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO333 - Crime and Society

      
      
       This module provides first year students with a general introduction to the various ways in which cultural dynamics intertwine with the practices of crime and crime control within contemporary society.  To that end, the course will contain lectures on subjects such as crime and everyday life, "reality" crime tv, surveillance and the culture of control, and police culture and the politics of crime control.  The module will also seek to introduce students to other essential areas of criminological interest (such as the critical analysis of criminological theory, and criminological methods) via innovative teaching techniques involving staff debates and the close textual reading/analysis of contemporary crime news stories.  In addition, this module provides a space to embed key generic social science skills (in the form of three lecture-seminar slots)

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO337 - Fundamentals of Sociology

      
      
       This course provides grounding in the basic history and assumptions of sociological thinking and research, and how they apply to key aspects of our society. Topics are less from everyday experience than in the Sociology of Everyday Life course, focusing on more abstract topics such as the state and globalization. Students will also be encouraged to consider competing perspectives on these topics and how they might be assessed. There will be a lecture and seminar each week and students will be encouraged to engage in informed discussion and debate. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO341 - Critical Thinking

      
      
       This module aims to develop key research and critical skills in students on their arrival at Kent, which they can build on in their further research and substantive modules in their degree.  Learning will be oriented around two applied tasks: i. A study of sociological, criminological and policy issues in different areas in Kent, with students undertaking one field trip to the area that are allocated to their group;ii. A study of stratification (class, gender, age, ethnicity, disability, sexuality etc) within the student body itself, potentially using data from the new Kent Self-Study (a large, longitudinal survey of Kent students) and new qualitative data.  These two tasks will each be oriented around a particular question (e.g. students imagined futures, patterns of teenage pregnancy in Kent).  Students will first be taught about the practical issues in collecting relevant data, after which they then collect the data, and then reflect upon both their findings and the data collection process itself.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO305 - Introduction to Criminology

      
      
       Crime is a major social and political issue and the source of much academic and popular debate.  Key criminological issues will be examined during the course of the module within their wider sociological and social policy context.  There will be a particular focus on understanding the nature and extent of crime and victimisation, analysing public and media perceptions of crime, and exploring the relationship between key social divisions (age, gender and ethnicity) and patterns of offending and victimisation.

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SO601 - Welfare in Modern Britain

      
      
       This module provides students with basic accounts of the scope and scale of the British welfare system, and the theoretical basis for its existence and growth. The recent history and current organisation of the main areas of social welfare provision such as social security, education, health, social care and housing are explored. These services which comprise the welfare state are situated in the broader context of welfare provided from non-state sources: the family, the market, community and voluntary sector and debates regarding how welfare should be provided and funded. The module examines how policies are formulated and the processes through which they are implemented and revised. It also considers the impact that social policies have on social inequality and difference based on class, ethnicity, gender, disability or age. Welfare in Modern Britain is a core module for those taking Social Policy and related degrees, but is also relevant to those with an interest in contemporary social problems and the policies aimed at addressing them.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SO602 - Social Research Methods

      
      
       In this module you will begin to understand the process and debates surrounding how researchers learn more about the social world. What techniques and approaches do social researchers draw upon to organise, structure and interpret research evidence? How do we judge the quality of research? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the range of frameworks and methodologies? The first part of the module introduces you to the conceptual issues and debates around the best way to explore social questions, forms and issues, and an overview of some popular methods for doing so. In the Spring Term, you will spend most of your time applying what you have learned in a group research project and an individual research design project.

      SO605 - Crime , Media and Culture

      
      
       The module provides students with an understanding of the contested cultural meanings underpinning crime.  Too often criminology is satisfied taking definitions of criminality at face value, when really it means very different things to different people and in different contexts.  The module examines how media representations propagate particular perceptions of crime, criminality and justice.  It goes on to consider the manner in which those who 'offend' experience and interpret their own behaviour, which may be focused on the attainment of excitement or indeed on attaining their own conception of justice.  The module explores these contradictions in a world where crime, control and the media saturate everyday life.  In doing so it considers a diverse range of concepts; youth culture, hedonism, hate crime, risk taking, moral panics, the image, emotionality and consumerism.  We examine the nature of a late-modern society where criminality inspires great fear and resentment, whilst at the same time it provides imagery which is harnessed to produce entertainment and sell a range of consumer goods.  Students will become familiar with cutting edge research and theory in the fields of Cultural Criminology, Visual Criminology, and Media and Crime, placing issues such as music, photography, street gangs, extreme sports, newspapers and nights on the town in new and exciting contexts.

      SO603 - Health and Health Policy

      
      
       This module will introduce students to the analysis of health policy focusing on recent policy changes in the UK and identifying the major influences which have shaped these policies.  There have been considerable changes in health service policy and health policy in the UK over the last decade involving changes to existing policies and the development of new policy themes. The latter have included a growing recognition of the need to address inequalities through public health policies but the relative neglect of environmental health policies, a focus on the views and/or the voice of the user and the public, the emergence of evidence-based policy and practice, the marketisation and privatisation of health care, the introduction of managerialism and the attempts to regulate the medical profession. This module provides an analysis of these recent policy developments and explores to what extent they reflect significant shifts in policy. What shapes these policies is examined through an exploration of the influence of professional medicine and other occupational groups including CAM, the pharmaceutical industry, the State, patients groups and the wider global environment. It links analysis of the theory of policy making with an analysis of empirical examples.

Using the examples of vegetarianism and religion, it examines the way food is entwined with symbolic and moral categorisations. The module as also addresses the political and policy issues raised by food, exploring government involvement in the area of ingestion, drawing parallels between food, alcohol and tobacco. In doing so it addresses the political issues raised by the large corporate interests of the food industry, and the role of the market in shaping provision.

       This module covers key issues and debates in the sociology of religion in order to interrogate the significance of religious practice and belief in the modern world. After an introductory lecture, the module is organised into two connected parts. Firstly, it explores classical statements on the sources, meaning and fate of religion in modernity by examining the writings of Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel, and using their analyses to interrogate current events (e.g. prosperity Pentecostalism, the rise of the supernatural in culture through such media as the Harry Potter novels, and violent responses to transgressions of what religions consider to be sacred). The emphasis here is on developing in students the knowledge and skills necessary to appreciate and engage critically with the significance of religion for the development of sociology, and with key statements about the modern fate of religion in and beyond the West. Second, the module explores core issues concerned with and associated with the secularisation debate. Here, we look not only at conventional arguments concerning secularisation and de-secularisation, but also at the significance of the return of the sacred in society, civil religion, the material experience of religion, and the manner in which religious identities and habits are developed in the contemporary world. This enables us to develop new perspectives on the viability of religion in current times. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO678 - Caring for Vulnerable Adults: Understanding Social Care

      
      
       Social care is of central significance in the support of a range of vulnerable adults. As such it is one of the key services of the welfare state, though one that often loses out to higher profile concern with medical care.   In this module we trace the development of social care from its origins in nineteenth century philanthropy, through its consolidation as a key service within the post war welfare state, to its current state of flux as it becomes increasingly fragmented and subject to new models of provision. The module looks at the care experiences of people with physical disabilities whether acquired in childhood or as result of accident or illness later in life; with learning difficulties; and mental health problems; as well as frail older people, exploring user perspectives and questions of empowerment.   It also addresses those who provide care and support in the form of family carers and paid workers, whether social workers or care assistants, addressing policy debates concerning the role of the state and family in provision.  It analyses the key social and policy debates in this field: for example: can we afford the cost of the rising numbers of older people? What role does ageism play in recent scandals about the quality of care provision? How can we support family carers?  How do we integrate people with learning disability into wider society?  In doing so it raises issues of funding, affordability and the mixed economy of care, as well as addressing fundamental questions about how disability, age and care are experienced and understood.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

       The module provides an overview of the contribution of the third sector to social, economic and political life.  It includes analysis of definitions and categorisations, exploration of the theories which underpin the study of the third sector, an examination of theories and the current state of volunteering and charitable giving, examination of the historical and current public policy agenda in relation to the third sector in the UK, the EU and more generally and, an overview of current issues in the third sector and how social scientists go about studying them.

      SO595 - Reproductive Health Policy in Britain

      
      
       Contraception, abortion, and teenage pregnancy are the subjects of public controversy in Britain. This module takes these aspects of reproductive health as its main examples. We will consider why contraception, abortion and teenage pregnancy became the subject of policy-making, and look at how policy about them has changed over time. Attention will be drawn to areas of debate that are currently particularly controversial, to encourage students to consider the ways in which policy could develop.

      SO575 - Poverty, Inequality and Social Security

      
      
       The coalition government has argued that following the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent double-drip recession adoption, the UK has no option but to pursue austerity policies.  This has included a huge squeeze on spending on cash transfers often referred to as 'welfare'.This module focuses on poverty and inequality and how such social security policies impact upon them.  Students will analyse the nature, extent and causes of poverty and inequality, with reference to the UK.  The module will make students aware of current issues in welfare reform as it relates to groups vulnerable to poverty including:  people who are unemployed;  people who are sick or disabled;  older people;  children;  lone parents;  people from Black or minority ethnic groups.  The module also shows how social security policies encompass different principles of need, rights and entitlement for users of welfare services.It is designed to be of interest to Sociology and Health and Social Care students as well as Social Policy students.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO702 - Sociology and Social Politics of the Family

      
      
       Often presented as the most natural form of human organisation, the family's changing nature over time indicates it is no such thing. Particularly since the Second World War, driven by the transformation of women's position within society, the very idea of a typical family has been called into question. The numbers of those choosing to live alone in contemporary society even calls into question the very notion of family at all. This module explores how the family has changed historically in its role and relationship to the individual and society. We trace the development of the modern, private family and how it has been shaped by socio-economic, cultural and political pressures. We will particularly focus upon the tension between this private 'haven in a heartless world' and a society anxious about the family's apparent instability.Synopsis of the curriculum The social history of the family and its transformations. The sociology of the public/private split The evolution of policies relating to family life  The individualisation thesis The economics and obligations of the family Recent social and demographic changes considered to underlie the problem of  the contemporary family (changes in fertility patterns, in marriage and co-habitation, the rise of single person households)  Debates about specific current policies about parenting  Critiques of state intervention in family life

      SO509 - Health, Illness and Medicine

      
      
       Health, illness and medicine are by no means static concepts. Their meaning has changed over time, and there is competition and conflict over what they mean. For example, in recent decades, health has come to mean much more the absence of disease. This is the age of healthy eating, sexual health, holistic health, healthy lifestyles and healthy living. We live in a time when medicine can mean homeopathy or acupuncture, as well as heart surgery and vaccinations. Health is also something we seem to worry about, and panic over; recent years have witnessed high profile scares about eating beef, using the contraceptive pill and mobile phones, and giving babies the MMR vaccine. Health, Illness and Medicine discusses key ideas and concepts developed by social scientists that can help us understand these, and other, aspects of our society.

      SO532 - Mental Health

      
      
       This module introduces students to the sociological approach to understanding mental health. It begins by outlining historical definitions of mental health and how policy and practice have changed over time from incarceration in large institutions to present-day community care. Sociological perspectives of mental illness (for example, the sociology of suicide, labelling and social causations of mental ill-health)  are considered alongside psychiatric and psychological approaches to treating people with mental illnesses. The module then looks at social inequalities in relation to opportunities to recover, including gender and race, as well as where sufferers are within the life-course (including young people and older people with dementia).Mental health and the criminal justice system as well as religion/spirituality and faith are also explored.  Please note, as this is not a clinical module material covered will not include in-depth investigations of specific diagnoses of mental illnesses.

      SO538 - Childhood, Society and Children's Rights

      
      
       This module provides a broad-based introduction to the concept of childhood, its historical evolution (including contemporary influences arising from new technologies and electronic media) and its 'social construction'. Within this context, different perspectives on childrens rights are examined, contrasting those which emphasise children's vulnerability and need for forms of protection and others which argue for children's participation, empowerment or even liberation. The module will also examine contemporary social problems e.g. child labour, sexual exploitation in terms of understandings of childhood and children's rights. Although there are no formal co-requisites for this module, its subject matter fits well with that covered in SA531 The Care and Protection of Children.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
