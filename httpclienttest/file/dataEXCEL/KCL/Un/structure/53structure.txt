The European Politics programme was introduced in 2013. The department of European   International Studies reviews the modules offered on a regular basis in order to maintain an innovative and exciting programme and therefore this list is subject to change and not all of the optional modules are available each year. Students are also able to take certain modules from other departments in the College subject to approval from the student&rsquo;s personal tutor and the individual module convenors. In addition, students have the option to undertake 30 credits of modern language courses. All modules are worth 30 credits unless otherwise indicated.
