      Assessment:  
      written examination/s;     coursework;       (1) One 2,000 word language analysis tasks (22%)
(2) Another 2,000 word language analysis task (22%)
(3) One 2 hour examination (46%)
(4) Attendance - 10% awarded unless student misses more than 6 sessions, which (in the absence of accepted mitigating circumstances) will result in zero being awarded for this element of assessment (10%).
     
  To an extent, this module builds on some of the introductory work in linguistics and language description covered in 4SSEL001 Language and Communication. The principal focus is on the application of the tools of linguistic analysis to English language data, mainly authentic, and both spoken and written. Areas of English phonology, grammar and lexis are examined, as well as a range of varieties of written and spoken English. Use is made of audio/videotaped language data and at times an electronically-held language corpora tool.

      Assessment:  
      coursework       (1) One 3,000-word essay (45%)
(2) One 3,000-word ethnographic study of a communicative event (45%)
(3) Attendance - 10% awarded unless student misses more than 3 sessions per semester, which (in the absence of accepted mitigating circumstances) will result in zero being awarded for this element of assessment (10%).
     
  This module is concerned with the relationship between language and society. The first half of the module (Semester One) focuses on linguistic aspects of sociolinguistics: how social factors influence the ways in which people use language, and how language varieties and patterns of use relate to social attributes such as class, sex and age. The second part (Semester Two) concentrates on the social aspects of sociolinguistics, looking at gender and ethnicity in particular, and qualitative rather than quantitative approaches are emphasised (ethnography and interactional discourse analysis). We discuss empirical research methods, and for your second assessment, you will carry out a small-scale project yourself, writing the ethnographic description of a familiar communicative event.

  Building on in-depth examinations of theoretical perspectives about children&rsquo;s development of a first language, this first year module will facilitate students&rsquo; understandings of the nature of first language acquisition. The module will focus on where language comes from, the stages children pass through to read adult-like speech, as well as attempts to teach non-human animals to use language. Topics covered will include specific aspects of language (e.g., phonology, morphology, lexicon), the role of the &lsquo;input&rsquo;, the relation between cognition and language, neurological development, and learning to read. Focus will be primarily on informal learning situations such as home and playgrounds. However, there will be occasion to discuss more formal opportunities for learning.

  This module provides a unique combination of theory and practice. Based on the understanding of the need for &lsquo;global citizens&rsquo; to be competent in more than one language, the module presents the main language learning theories, as well as different approaches to the teaching and learning of grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. Students have the opportunity to apply this theoretical knowledge to their own experience of language learning. They will undertake six hours of studying a new language of their choice, and will be asked to reflect on and analyse this experience in their own language learning case study.
  
      
     
    
      
  
  
  
    
  
  
    
    
  
    
  
   
   
   
   
  
     
  
    
    YEAR 2
   Students take the compulsory modules (Research Methods, plus a minimum of 2 of English Lexis, English Grammar and English Phonology and Phonetics), plus a selection of optional modules to equal 120 credits in total for Year 2. Students may choose all three of Lexis, Grammar and Phonology and Phonetics if they wish. A few selected Level 6 modules (those listed under 'Year 3 options') may be available for students to take in Year 2 as well. 
In addition to the BA ELL optional modules, students may opt to take a language module
 from the Modern Language Centre and/or a Level 5 literature module from the English Department
 (subject to availability; registration at the discretion of the English Department). Not including the language modules, students may take a maximum of 30 optional credits from outside of the BA ELL list of modules over the course of their degree.

(2) Another 2,000 word essay (50%).
     
  This module builds on the knowledge and skills acquired during Analysing English 1 in Year 1, and is divided into two distinct parts. The first part of the module deals with the study of more complex aspects of English phonology and phonetics: the production and reception of speech sounds, features of connected speech, weak forms, word stress, and intonation. The second part goes beyond these theoretical areas of study to consider accents (prestige, non-prestige, and stigmatised; L1 and L2) and the issues they raise in relation to language attitudes.
  
    English Grammar - Required

      written examination/s       (1) One 3 hour examination (100%).
     
  English Grammar builds on analytical skills learnt in Year 1 which illuminated grammatical form. It does this by taking a functional approach. Using Systemic Functional Grammar, where the role of grammar in meaning-making is emphasised, the module will enable you deepen your understanding of how texts communicate as well as facilitate your evaluation of their communicative effectiveness. This module provides students with both the functional tools and theoretical frameworks to develop evidence based accounts of written language. It also draws on a number of the tools of linguistic analysis introduced in the foundational first year modules, and provides further application of the analytical skills and theoretical frameworks encountered throughout the BA degree.

  Have you ever wondered why language is the way it is? Why are nouns and verbs so fundamental? Why do some languages have features that others do not? This module takes you through theories about the origins of language, showing how our understanding has matured over time. It presents a range of ideas about the way language works, and then gives you the opportunity to design your own language. Working through the system of your language will give you an understanding of the systematic features used by real languages, and the reasons why language came to be.

Computers and collections of machine readable texts have become a central resource in empirical linguistic research. These applications can range across the consideration of individual literary texts, the analysis of major written or spoken registers (newspapers/Hansard debates), through to the extensive accounts of contemporary written and spoken language one finds in modern dictionaries and grammars. This module aims to ensure that you understand the emerging tradition in computer mediated language description and analysis, are able to analyse individual texts and large text collections (corpora) using computer programs available at KCL, and are able to apply this understanding in practical descriptive and analytic tasks.

  How we tell stories and what our stories reveal about us, our lives and our relations with others has attracted the attention of numerous strands of social scientific inquiry. It is notable that narrative research interviews constitute the main qualitative method for identity analysis. Discourse and sociolinguistic studies of storytelling have drawn on this diversity of social scientific work but they have also infused it with vital insights into how everyday life stories are told in interaction with other people and in specific contexts. The aim of this module is to familiarise you with the main frameworks within discourse and sociolinguistic studies for the analysis of stories and identities. The presentation of concepts and analytical tools will become tangible with close analysis of a wide range of stories from various everyday life contexts: caf&eacute;s, classrooms, the workplace, social media platforms, etc.

This module provides students with both the tools and the theoretical frameworks to analyse and critically engage with contemporary media language. The analytical and theoretical tools derive from Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). By &lsquo;electronic&rsquo;, the module acknowledges the development of many forms of media in recent years which often rely, though not exclusively, on the world-wide-web. That many forms of contemporary media are electronic can allow for convenient capture and empirical investigation using appropriate software programs. Indeed, the module will show how qualitative analysis of electronic media language can usefully be supplemented by its quantitative analysis. By the end of the module, students will have developed an informed understanding of the relationship between language, contemporary electronic media and society, which will facilitate engagement in informed discussion and critique.

  Corpus Linguistics is the software-based, quantitative investigation of a collection of electronic texts; such a collection &ndash; usually a large one - is referred to as a &lsquo;corpus&rsquo; &ndash; a body of texts which is usually compiled in a principled manner. There has never been a time with so much English language data readily available for investigation. The world-wide-web contains many billions of words of English usage and is increasingly being trawled for corpus construction. In this practically-oriented module, you will be shown:
- the value of analysing ready-made large corpora for getting a &lsquo;God&rsquo;s-eye&rsquo; view on the English language and seeing things that were invisible until very recently;
- how you can construct your own corpora (potentially anything in digital format - a corpus of songs by The Beatles, a corpus of Amazon book reviews, a corpus of your academic essays, and so on) in order to find out recurrences of expression and theme that would otherwise be difficult to see.
You will receive a solid grounding in how to use appropriate software to search through corpora. The software you will be trained in is simple to learn and fun to use.

  This module explores a range of debates and puzzles in contemporary philosophy of language concerning theories of meaning, notions of reference, identity and necessity, and the relationships between language and conceptions of truth and reality. The module provides the opportunity to engage with the very latest thinking in the field, enabling participants to weight the merits of the often controversial and thought-provoking arguments that have come to characterise philosophical inquiry into the nature and purpose of language.

  The process in which certain languages become standard (rendering others non-standard) and the politics and ideologies of such standardisation have been extensively researched within socio-cultural and historical approaches to language and communication. Drawing on key-findings and the latest thinking in this multi-strand inquiry, the module will examine a wide range of language planning and policy traditions as historicised and situated practices: closely linked with the creation of national and post-national, local and global identities, and the development of culture-specific moral and aesthetic attitudes to appropriate communication behaviour. The theoretical input will be substantiated by empirical case-studies from a variety of languages and societies. The discussion of key-moments of standardisation from such studies will cross-link with language prescriptivism in a historical and contemporary European context (e.g. Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Denmark), with cases of language revitalisation (e.g. Hebrew, Maori, Welsh) and reform (e.g. Turkish), and with (postcolonial) multilingualism and Global Englishes. An important part of the module will be the engagement with recent literature that has begun to change older assumptions about language standardisation (e.g. by documenting the role of globalisation and social media in the rise of regional language varieties).

  This module covers various aspects of how research has attempted to explore and delineate the interaction between language and mind. In the course of our discussions, we will aim to familiarise the group with a variety of theories that have driven much of the research in this field. In addition, the potentials and limitations of research methods will form a significant part of our discussions. In the past, research has been focussed on Western languages, mainly English, ignoring the majority of people in the world, who speak one or more non-English languages. We will discuss the consequences of equating language and mind processes across the world and attempt to uncover the nuances of more recent research that addresses the ways speakers of different languages think. One of our main goals is to highlight the ways that theoretical perspectives and research methods can both guide and blind researchers to the conclusions they draw from their studies.

  In the contemporary world, people are saying that language and discourse are now more important than ever before, and across the Humanities and Social Sciences, there has been a major &lsquo;discursive/linguistic turn&rsquo;. Instead of trying to identify the central, stable features that characterise different individuals, groups or &lsquo;cultures&rsquo;, researchers are now much more interested in trying to establish the ways in which language and discourse are used to construct cultural difference and social identity, both in face-to-face interaction and in public representations.
So this module looks at the debates about the role that language places in power, ideology, resistance and social change, and considers several major 20th century cultural theorists, such as Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault and Erving Goffman.

  The analysis of communication on social media is rapidly becoming a key-area in (socio)linguistics and discourse studies. This module introduces you to the main methods of data collection and analysis of language and discourse for a variety of social media contexts. The module combines familiarisation with frameworks of analysis with practical steps on how to approach data. A variety of case-studies of social media afforded practices (e.g. sharing, tagging, Like   Follow) ranging from YouTube to Facebook and Twitter illustrate the role of a range of language and multimodal resources in presenting ourselves and relating with others online. Throughout the module, you will be encouraged to bring in your own experiences of social media engagements and gradually put together your own techno-linguistic biography.

  This module is taught by several members of staff, each contributing a personal area of expertise. The topics included are linked through the consideration of what happens when individuals and groups do not fit in with, or challenge, institutionalised notions of language. There are three criss-crossing themes within the module. The first theme addresses the boundaries that are traditionally considered to exist between languages, examining the way such boundaries are challenged by the influences of digital technologies, the globalisation of communicative practices, and contact between diverse groups. The second theme considers the impact of national boundaries on the representations of languages and their speakers, examining the effects of classifications such as &lsquo;national&rsquo;, &lsquo;regional&rsquo; and &lsquo;minority&rsquo; languages, and considering the experiences of speakers of &lsquo;transnational&rsquo; languages. The final theme deals with the institutional boundaries that create a mismatch between the way language is used and the way it is expected to be used in certain contexts such as schools. We consider the experiences of children whose home languages are not recognised at school, both in the UK and in developing, postcolonial countries, and we discuss different issues such as &lsquo;bilingual education&rsquo; and &lsquo;linguistic human rights&rsquo;.

Linguistic Politeness looks at different ways of conceptualising politeness; from folk definitions and lay perceptions of what constitutes polite language and behaviour to politeness theories. It introduces you to pragmatic and discursive approaches to politeness, as well as having a strong practical component which will involve investigating how politeness can be best captured in everyday interaction and compared across groups. We will discuss different types of data and different methodologies and cover the full range of politeness phenomena, including impoliteness.

This module offers a critical appraisal of ideas about the nature of literacy and their implications for social life in Late Modernity. The module is founded on a combination of the ethnography of communication tradition and new studies in discourse and ideology, as they underlie different conceptions and descriptions of literacy in particular and communicative practices more generally. Special attention is paid to literacy practices in their social and cultural contexts (both in the UK and in &lsquo;developing&rsquo; countries, e.g. Nepal, South Africa). There will be scope for participants to research and report on aspects of literacy of particular interest to them, and to relate the general debates to their own experience. There will also be sessions on multi modality and on the academic literacies required of students, and what this tells us more broadly about discourse, identity and power in the academy.

Literature and language are often studied separately, but need not be. Literature is an extraordinary use of language: eloquent, inspiring, and skilled. Stylistics sets out to use the tools of linguistics - phonology, grammar, semantics and pragmatics - to understand the powerful effects of literary language. In this module, we analyse a variety of texts &ndash; including ones chosen by students. We consider whether literary language has some specific and unique qualities, and how the stylistic approach relates to other literary theories. We shall consider literature both as text and as performance. We also extend our view beyond the conventional literary canon and look at genres which are quasi-literary &ndash; in that they have some poetic features - such as songs, rhymes, advertisements, comedy routines, prayers, orations.

  This module connects with a range of other modules on additional language teaching and learning whilst giving an overview of some of the most current issues in the theory and practice of language pedagogy. The topics follow the expertise of the different lecturers contributing to the module and range from diversity in educational discourses, the use of technology and media in language teaching, to critical approaches to language textbooks, and &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; in language teaching. The module also introduces psychological and social aspects of language learning such as the development of new identities and the role of affect and emotions in language learning.
