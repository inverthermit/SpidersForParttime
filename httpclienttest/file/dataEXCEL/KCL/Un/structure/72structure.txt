Currently, students study the following core modules. If there are options available the current choices are also shown. King's reviews its optional modules on a regular basis, in order to continue to offer innovative and exciting programmes and this list is therefore subject to change. Please check here for updates, or contact the department(s) for further advice.   
  
     
    YEAR 1
  You should take the core modules outlined plus modules totalling 60 credits in Music. Native German speakers also choose one optional German module. (This is because their German language module is worth 15 credits, rather than the 30-credit core language module taken by non-native speakers.)  Those studying beginners' German (ab initio) take a different, specially-designed core language module.
