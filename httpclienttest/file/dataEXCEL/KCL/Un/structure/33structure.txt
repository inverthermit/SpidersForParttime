    YEAR 1
  Students admitted to this programme will be exempt from the first two years of the standard five-year programme A205 on the basis of their previous studies. Students will undertake a two- to three-week preparatory course in September 2014 before joining year  three of the five-year BDS programme. Examinations are held at the end of each year, and a percentage of the marks for each examination are derived from in-course assessment, which may take the form of essays, practical tests or project work.
