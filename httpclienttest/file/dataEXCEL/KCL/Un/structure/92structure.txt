  If you want a qualifying law degree, then you must have studied law of contract. Also, you make contracts every day, so it is quite interesting to know the law supporting them. Apart from that, more generally, in the English legal system, contract law is mainly based on case law, that is, previous case decisions made by the Supreme Court (formerly, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords) and Court of Appeal.
You therefore learn how case law works as a source of law, which involves inductive logic and living with uncertainty. This is explored further in the seminars. In the tutorials, application of the legal rules to hypothetical factual situations (apart from being fun) is an excellent exercise in analytic reasoning and allows you practice in formulating arguments.
Thus, both intrinsically and in view of transferable skills which you will acquire, study of the Elements of Contract Law is an excellent beginning to your law degree.
Module content
The order of topics may vary but assuming the same pattern as 2013-14: Semester 1, basically, the first half of the semester we cover formation of a contract (making contracts); the second half, factors which might break a contract (vitiating factors) such as Mistake, Misrepresentation, Frustration, Duress and Undue Influence. In the first half of Semester 2 we look in more detail at what is in a contract i.e. terms (express and implied), exclusion clauses, control of unfair contract terms; in the second half, what happens when it all goes wrong &ndash; remedies for breach of contract.
In addition there are 4 pieces of formative coursework set during the two teaching semesters (including a 1 hour midsessional exam) although these are for practice purposes and do not count towards your final mark of the module.

  Module description
Property law involves a study of the types of interests which can exist in land, the rights and duties generated by them, and whether and how they can be protected against third parties acquiring other interests in the land, and (in outline) how they can be transferred.
The interests studied include interests in the family home and co-ownership interests generally, and commercial interests such as leases, mortgages, easements (e.g. rights of way) and covenants. Informal interests such as occupational licences and interests arising by estoppel are also considered. The module also considers the extent to which the Human Rights Act 1998 affects property rights.
The course involves a mix of case law and statutory provisions, with emphasis on reform proposals.
Structured seminar materials are provided, consisting of references to case law, statutes, articles and Law Commission reports, followed by a list of discussion points and problem questions.
* Property and Trusts are in some respects complementary, so that students intending to take both options are recommended to take them concurrently.
In addition there are 2 pieces of formative coursework required during the academic year although these are for practice purposes and do not count towards your final mark of the module.
