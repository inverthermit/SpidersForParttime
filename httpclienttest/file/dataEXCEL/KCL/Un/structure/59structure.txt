All students study two compulsory modules and select one optional module based on their intended degree subject. All of the modules support your critical thinking skills development as they encourage you to analyse concepts and develop reasoned arguments within your chosen subject area. All modules run throughout the academic year to ensure you have the opportunity to develop and improve key skill areas. 
Teaching is a mix of lectures, seminars and classes and all students will have time dedicated to self-study and independent research tasks. You will be assigned a personal tutor and meet with them on a regular basis to receive individual advice on your progress. You will also have the opportunity to take a range of optional IELTS classes and tutorials across all terms. In addition, during term one you will receive UCAS workshops and tutorials to support you in making appropriate university and subject choices. LNAT classes are also available for Law pathway students. 
All of the modules support your subject and linguistic skills development as they encourage you to analyse concepts and develop ideas and arguments in your chosen subject area.
