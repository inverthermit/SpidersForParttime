   YEAR 3
   Study becomes even more focused in the third year, where students choose a Group III module which involves studying primary source materials and writing a research dissertation. This specialised approach is balanced by choosing one Thematic Special Subject, in which students think comparatively and theoretically about the different periods and places they have studied in their degree so far. In addition, third year students choose to study either a second year module (see above) or write a free-standing dissertation of 10,000 words on a research topic of their choice, individually supervised by a member of academic staff.

Augustus: Power and Propaganda
