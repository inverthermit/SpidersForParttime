You will study three modules on this programme. All students take the core module called Academic   Scientific Foundation English. You will also choose two optional modules from Biology, Chemistry, Maths, Economics and Physics. The choice will depend on the subject you wish to study at undergraduate level. 
The core module is delivered by the ELC and the optional modules by the relevant King&rsquo;s department. This means that you are taught by King&rsquo;s academics during your foundation year. 
Teaching is a mix of lectures, seminars, lab-based work and classes and all students will have time dedicated to self-study and independent research tasks. All of the modules support your subject and linguistic skills development as they encourage you to analyse concepts and develop ideas in your chosen subject area. 
You will also have the opportunity to take a range of optional IELTS classes. UCAS workshops and tutorials are scheduled for term one.
