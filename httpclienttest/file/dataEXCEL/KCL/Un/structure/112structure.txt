The BSc Medical Physiology comprises core modules taken by all students and optional modules from a choice of disciplines in years two and three. The current core modules and optional choices are shown below, however, King's reviews its modules on a regular basis, in order to offer innovative and exciting programmes and this list is therefore subject to change. Please check here for updates, or contact the School/Department for further advice.   
  
     
    YEAR 1
