Currently, students study the following core modules (modules are 15 credits unless otherwise stated). We review our options on a regular basis, in order to continue to offer innovative and exciting programmes and this list is therefore subject to change. Please check here for updates, or contact the School/department for further advice.   
  
     
    YEAR 1
  You should take the core modules outlined below. Native German speakers also choose one optional German module.

Those studying beginners' German (ab initio) take a different, specially-designed core language module.
