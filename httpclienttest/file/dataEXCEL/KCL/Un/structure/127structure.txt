This new and innovative programme aims to develop nurses who can provide outstanding care across a range of practice settings while meeting all of the registration requirements of the Nursing and Midwifery Council.   
  
     
    YEAR 1
  Nursing students undertake a range of modules which focus on quality care, cutting edge clinical skills, professional delivery and the knowledge and skills required to undertake them. You will learn the pivotal roles of the nurse as practitioner partner and leader. A blend of college based activities will underpin periods of clinical practice.
Degree students become increasingly clinically focused in their second year, extending their ability to influence patient care and team working.
 
     
    
  
    
  
   
   
   
   
  
     
  
    
    YEAR 2
   During this year your modules will become increasingly clinically focussed in your area of practice. Again, practice placements will allow you to apply the knowledge gained in your modules in a variety of settings with different client groups. There is an opportunity for international/national elective placement and a choice of an optional module during this year.
