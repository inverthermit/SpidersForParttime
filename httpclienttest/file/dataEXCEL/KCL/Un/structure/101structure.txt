YEAR 1
  In addition to the core module, you will study a range of option modules drawn from across

YEAR ONE LANGUAGE MODULE
You will study a compulsory first year foreign language module which can be selected from a range of modules (excluding linguistics) offered by the Modern Language Centre (MLC) here at King's. Latin is also available.

  From Roman traders to modern commuters, millions of people have lived in the same few square miles where you will spend the bulk of your undergraduate career. As you begin your education at King's College London, this module will provide snapshots of these various lives, from 1666 to the present. Looking at the experiences of the impoverished and anonymous as well as London&rsquo;s more famous denizens, we will catch revealing glimpses not only of individual Londoners, but the changing life of the city itself. We will proceed chronologically and geographically, studying the social and cultural lives of given areas during particular periods.
As the foundational module in your first year of study, this module will take a strongly inter-disciplinary approach, which will introduce you to the full diversity of the liberal arts curriculum, including the study of archaeology, theology, art history, sociology, and literature. In addition to attending lectures and seminars, you will undertake structured visits to a range of museums, theatres and other public spaces. 
As you will come to see by the end of this module, London, in all its struggles and achievements, is a fascinating microcosm of the wider world; and as such, an ideal laboratory for the study of liberal arts.

These options will vary year on year as modules are linked to the research interests of staff which may change.   If you accumulate enough credits in a particular subject this will be recognised on your transcript as a minor.   You can also take an internship module, in which you will be supported in the process of locating an internship, and write a report which will give you credit towards your degree.
  
You will have the chance to spend the second semester of year two at one of the College's global partner institutions, which include the National University of Singapore (NUS), Hong Kong University (HKU), the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill), the New School (New York City), and a number of European Universities such as the Humboldt University in Berlin.
