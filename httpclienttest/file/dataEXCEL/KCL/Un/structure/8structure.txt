    Full-year      
   
    Teaching pattern:  
A short, two-lecture module in the second semester of the academic year will introduce students to the project  and provide instruction on how to manage it. Assessment will be on the  basis of the submitted project report, and on an oral presentation of  the project material.  
  
      Assessment:  
      coursework;     oral examination/s;       Project report to be handed in towards the end of  February of the student's final year. Oral exams to be held in the March  of the student's final year.
     
  Prerequisites: Students eligible for the project should have achieved an average mark of at least 55% in the first year of their undergraduate module. However students who do not achieve this average can request approval from potential supervisors to take the project.
Aims and Objectives
A final year project often offers you an opportunity to study a field of interest in depth and face, perhaps for the first time, the practical problems of using knowledge you have acquired in lecture modules.  The aim of the Project is for students to undertake an individual research study of their choice that will allow them to use knowledge, acquired from previous studies and their own research, in order to analyse organisational practices and problems. The project will typically involve a combination of library based research and/ or limited fieldwork and will be supervised by a member of academic staff from the Department of Management.  The final report must be no more than 10,000 words in length and must be submitted by early March 2010.  Assessment will be on the basis of the report, and an oral presentation of the project material.  The project counts for 25% of the student's third year mark.  The project is valued at 30 credits; equivalent to two taught third year modules.  Students opting for this module are expected to have obtained an average of 2:1 in their first year of study.  This should indicate to students the amount of work expected on the project.
After undertaking this module students should be able to:
Work independently on a specific project.
Write an extended report which provides details of why and how the research has been undertaken, leading to an analysis of relevant literature and ideas, and an application of this conceptual understanding to an analysis of organisational practices and problems. 
Be able to think through how the insights from the research project could influence organisational research and /or practice.
