The first two years of the course are identical for all students. In the third year students will have the choice of 2 optional modules and in the fourth year there will be a choice of 11 optional modules. King's reviews its options on a regular basis, in order to continue to offer innovative and exciting programmes and this list is therefore subject to change. Please check here for updates, or contact the Department for further advice.
