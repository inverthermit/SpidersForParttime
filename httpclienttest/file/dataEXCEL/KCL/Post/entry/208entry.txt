ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   A minimum undergraduate honours degree with 2:1 classification (or overseas equivalent) in a humanities subject with a significant element relating to classical antiquity or the Middle Ages. Graduates of universities in Greece should have a minimum average grade of 7.5, and those from Cyprus should have a minimum grade of 8.0, in a ptychion. If you do not have a formal qualification in any ancient language you may still be considered if you take at least a basic course before the start of your MA studies. This will be discussed prior to your application with a member of staff.
