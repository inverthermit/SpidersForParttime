ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice    Academic requirements:  A 2:1 class honours degree (or international equivalent) is usually required in a relevant subject (including, but not limited to, a modern foreign language, English, Education, Linguistics etc).  If you have a lower degree classification, or a degree in an unrelated subject, your application may be considered if you can demonstrate significant relevant work experience, or offer a related graduate qualification (such as a Masters or PGDip). Professional requirements:  All applicants should also have experience equivalent to three years' full-time in language teaching or a related post. Note :   if, in addition to the above, you also have the  Cambridge ESOL DELTA  or  Trinity House Diploma in ELT , then you may be eligible for the "fast track" version of this programme. The "fast track" gives you exemption from Principles & Practice in ELT, and one of the option courses. See the 'Structure' tab for further details.
