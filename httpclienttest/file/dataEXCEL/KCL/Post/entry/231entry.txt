ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Bachelor&rsquo;s degree with 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent). Applicants with a 2:2 (or overseas equivalent) considered if offering significant work experience in a related field. A degree level professional qualification in an appropriate subject, normally with some experience in the broad field of public health (or primary care for MPH (Primary Care) applicants) will also be considered.  For the  Master of Public Health  degree, rather than the Public Health MSc, students should normally be, or have been, employed in a public health agency.   Full-time students who have not been employed with a public health agency  can satisfy this requirement by undertaking their dissertation within a public health agency, such as the Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences at King's College London.  Some full-time students from overseas undertake their dissertation placement in their home country.     English language proficiency requirements apply for international students: please see this page for more information.  http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/pg/admissions/requirements/language.aspx.    For this programme we would like applicants to have met (and to supply evidence for) the required standard of English Language at the time they submit their application.
