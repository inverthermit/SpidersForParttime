ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice    Minimum requirements to be considered for the LLM:  Undergraduate degree with high 2:1 honours (i.e. overall average of at least 65%) in Law or a degree with at least 70% law content, or an equivalent international qualification and grading.   Exceptionally, you may be considered where a comparable academic level has been achieved through other graduate studies (such as a Graduate Diploma in Law) and where work or experience (at least three years legal work experience) has made you a suitable candidate for the LLM.  A guide to international equivalencies at King's by country can be found  here NOTE: Meeting the minimum requirements for your application to be considered does not guarantee an offer. Applications for this programme are competitive. See "Applying, fees and funding" for further guidance.
