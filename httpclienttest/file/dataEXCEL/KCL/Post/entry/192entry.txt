ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Minimum requirements to be considered for the LLM:   2:1 degree (or equivalent international qualification) in law (or a degree with at least 70% law content).   Exceptionally, you may be considered where a comparable academic level has been achieved through other graduate studies (such as a Graduate Diploma in Law) and where work or experience (at least three years legal work experience) has made you a suitable candidate for the LLM.   A pdf download of equivalent entry requirements by region is available from the "further information" tab.   NOTE: Meeting the minimum requirements for your application to be considered does not guarantee an offer. Applications for this programme are competitive.
