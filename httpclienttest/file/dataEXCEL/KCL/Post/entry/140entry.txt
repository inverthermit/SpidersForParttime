ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice     The basic requirement for admission to the LLM programme is a recognised first degree in law (or a degree with at least 70% law content) of at least upper second class honours standard or an equivalent overseas qualification. Exceptionally, you may be considered where a comparable academic level has been achieved through other graduate studies and where work or experience has made you a suitable candidate for the LLM.
