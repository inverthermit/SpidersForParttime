ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Candidates should have a 1st class   or 2:1 undergraduate degree (or international equivalent).   We may consider candidates with a lower second class degree or with professional qualifications from a recognised institution if they can:  show relevant work experience and/or relevant professional qualifications   demonstrate that they are highly motivated   provide referees from their university or employment strongly supporting their admission onto a masters level programme.  In these circumstances we will usually admit a student to our certificate or diploma programmes, possibly with a view to the student transferring to the master's programme if they successfully pass their first two examined subjects. Relevant professional qualifications will be taken into account.
