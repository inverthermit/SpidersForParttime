ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Applicants who wish to enrol for the LLM in International Tax may apply for admission on the basis of one of the following two paragraphs:  1. The applicant must hold  a recognised first degree in law (or a degree with at least 70% law content) of at least high upper second class honours standard or an equivalent overseas qualification  OR  2. The applicant must: (i) hold a recognised first degree in any discipline of at least high upper second class honours standard or an equivalent overseas qualification (with a preference for degrees in accounting or other tax-related fields); AND (ii) have at least 12 months&rsquo; appropriate work experience in the Tax sector.  Applicants fulfilling both the requirements contained in paragraph (2) may therefore apply to the LLM in International Tax even though they do not hold a first degree in law (or a degree with at least 70% law content) as would otherwise be required under paragraph (1) above. This entry route is intended for applicants who do not have a law degree but who have appropriate work experience in Tax, and who may previously have considered enrolling for our MA Tax programme (the MA Tax programme has been discontinued with effect from 2013-14).  Please note that applicants admitted to the LLM in International Tax on the basis of paragraph (2) above must enrol for this specialist LLM programme only. Following admission, they will not be permitted to enrol for any other specialist LLM (such as the LLM in International Financial Law or the LLM in Competition Law) or for our general LLM programme, and will be obliged to select only modules offered under the LLM in International Tax.
