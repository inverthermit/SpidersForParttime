ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of the following:   2:1 Bachelor's degree   (or international equivalent ) in single Mathematics or joint honours where half of the study is in Mathematics.   Physics is considered equivalent to mathematics and some computing and engineering courses can be acceptable but only if there is a strong pure mathematics element. A single honours in engineering would not usually be suitable. We will consider first degrees with some mathematics content less than the requirement if candidates are able to take a m athematics enhancement course,  which is a 22 week fully funded course starting in the January of the course year. Please address your willingness to take a mathematics enhancement course in your application if applicable.   Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach.  Applicants must Yhave detailed knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach, which is up to full A level Mathematics. We require a  high grade in at least one A level mathematics  (or equivalent)  GCSE grade C or above  (or an equivalent qualification)  in English language and Mathematics . Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts.
