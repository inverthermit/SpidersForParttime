ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice    Academic Requirements: The normal entry requirement for graduate study is a Bachelor's degree with minimum 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent).   Applicants who have already studied at a level equivalent to a UK Master's programme will be assessed primarily on the basis of achievement at this level and would be expected to demonstrate a clear pass (55% or above in the UK grading system).   Applicants with other backgrounds or qualifications, including those without a first degree, can be considered: if you do not meet the normal entry requirements or you have only the minimum academic standard you should pay particular attention in preparing your supporting statement and CV to ensure that you draw attention to evidence of potential success at graduate level. This might include publications, preparation of substantial reports or active participation in service development initiatives or funded research.      Professional and work experience:   Applicants wishing to apply for this programme must be qualified nurses accredited by their country's governing body and have a minimum two years' clinical experience. English language requirements:  All applicants must meet the minimum requirements for the School of Nursing & Midwifery: see  www.kcl.ac.uk/study/pg/admissions/requirements/language.aspx   Important note:   This programme is only open to overseas and non-UK EU applicants. If you are a "home" applicant then you may wish to consider applying for the  Advanced Practice  programme
