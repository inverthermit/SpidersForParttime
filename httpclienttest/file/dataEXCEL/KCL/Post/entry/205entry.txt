ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   A Bachelor's degree with 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) is usually required but not necessarily in a humanities subject.   We know that relevant background can be acquired by informal routes and we are delighted to consider all applications.   Applicants without experience in the field could also consider our  Graduate Diploma,  which is especially designed to ease the transition to Theology & Religious Studies from another subject.
