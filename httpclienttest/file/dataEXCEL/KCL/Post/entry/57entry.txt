ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Minimum standard is a 2:1 degree or international equivalent, e.g. GPA of 3.3 from a US University, with preference given to geography, natural sciences (such as environmental science, physics, chemistry and biology) and engineering subjects. Candidates who do not achieve a 2:1 but have professional or voluntary experience will also be considered. Mature candidates will be considered favourably.
