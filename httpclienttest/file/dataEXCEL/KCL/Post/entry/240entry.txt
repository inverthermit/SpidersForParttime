ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice     Students must have a  first class or high 2:1 BSc (honours) degree or overseas  equivalent in a life sciences or physical sciences  degree. MBBS students may also enter this  programme interrupting their medical degree and  therefore have already met their host institution's  entry requirements. MBBS students can be  admitted at any time following the third year of their  programme. Immediately post-year three: entry is  based on year three performance. Advanced years  (four to five): students must complete their current  year of study. External students need to obtain  permission from their own medical school and  provide evidence of their exam performance in the  pre-clinical examinations.
