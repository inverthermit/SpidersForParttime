Additionally , for specific PGCE subjects there may be additional requirements, such as:   Modern Foreign Languages:  applicants should have knowledge of at least two languages, either French and German or French and Spanish, with qualifications equivalent to at least AS-level in the subsidiary language. Classics  applicants need to have the equivalent of at least AS-level Latin.
