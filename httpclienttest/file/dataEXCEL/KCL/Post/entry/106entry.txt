ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   The normal entry requirement for graduate study is a Bachelor's degree with minimum 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent).   Applicants with other backgrounds or qualifications, including those without a first degree, can be considered. If you do not meet the normal entry requirements or you have only the minimum academic standard you should pay particular attention in preparing your supporting statement and CV to ensure that you draw attention to evidence of potential success at graduate level. This might include publications, preparation of substantial reports or active participation in service development initiatives or funded research.   Applicants wishing to enrol on this pathway must have secured sponsorship from a primary care provider in an appropriate district nursing setting for the duration of the programme.   Applicants must have a minimum three years&rsquo; clinical experience as a registered nurse (adult).
