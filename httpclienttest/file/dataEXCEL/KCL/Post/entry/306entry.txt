ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of:  Bachelor's degree with at least 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent) usually in the subject you wish to teach. Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach.   GCSE grade C or above (or an equivalent qualification) in English language and Mathematics. Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts.
