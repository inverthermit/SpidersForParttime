ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   A medical degree (MBBS or equivalent) or a 2:1 first degree in pharmacy, pharmacology, biology, biochemistry, chemistry or related subject, or overseas equivalent. Applicants without a degree but with relevant experience will be considered on an individual basis. Employment within a relevant industrial environment would be advantageous but is not essential. We will require two satisfactory references. If you have completed your degree in the last three years, one of your references should be an academic reference.  Overseas applicants should bear in mind that, as this is a part-time programme, they will not be eligible for a Tier 4 student visa.
