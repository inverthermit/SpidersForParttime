ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice     At least an upper second-class honours degree of a UK university, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard, or a registerable qualification in medicine, appropriate to the programme.

Any student who does not meet the minimum entry requirement above but who has relevant professional experience may still be eligible for admission. They should contact the programme leader  who can advise on their eligibility to apply.  EU/International students need to meet English Language Requirements: 7.0 overall for IELTS, with at least 7.0 for written English and at least 6.0 for the other skills.
