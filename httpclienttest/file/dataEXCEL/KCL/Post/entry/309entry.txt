ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of the following:   Bachelor's degree   or higher degree (e.g. Masters)  or international equivalent required   in Computer Science, Computing, Information Technology or Information Systems. Degrees with other titles that include a high Computer Science component may be equally good. Generally a degree graded at least  2:1  (or international equivalent) is expected as it demonstrates ability to engage with knowledge at an appropriate level. Extensive relevant experience beyond a degree may compensate for a lower grade.  Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach.  Applicants must have experience enabling them to teach Computer Science theory and practice to GCSE level and Information Technology to A-level. Enhancement courses: If your degree is in Information Technology but your knowledge of Computer Science is limited you may be asked to complete a one to six-month subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course. You have to secure a place on a PGCE course before you can start SKE, and SKE typically starts in May or July, so you are advised to apply early for the PGCE. For further guidance, see our detailed FAQs.  GCSE grade C or above  (or an equivalent qualification)  in English language and Mathematics . Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts.
