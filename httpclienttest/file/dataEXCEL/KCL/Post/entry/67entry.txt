ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   The course is an academic post-graduate course requiring evidence of critical and independent thought. Preference will be given to candidates with demonstrable experience in systematic therapies with a commitment to the CBT approach.   Teaching is pitched at a post-graduate level so candidates need to be able to produce academic work to this level relatively independently. Minimum entry requirements: A professional mental health qualification (e.g. clinical psychologist, mental health nurse, BACP accredited counsellor) with relevant clinical experience. Clinical Psychologist applications are accepted without post qualifying experience due to the nature of the Clinical Psychology training.   Those without a core profession who have at least two years&rsquo; post-qualification experience and are able to demonstrate they meet the required KSA criteria (please see the IAPT website for further information  http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/workforce/high-intensity/ )   Additional Requirements: Access to suitable CBT training cases, i.e. straightforward depression and anxiety, is essential.
