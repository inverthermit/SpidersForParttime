ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Our PGCE programmes all require a minimum of:    Bachelor's degree with at least  2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent)  , preferably in Classics, Classical Civilisation or Ancient History.   Your level of Latin will need to be at least AS level grade A (or the equivalent) and this will be assessed at interview through a translation exercise.    Knowledge and understanding of the subject you intend to teach.   GCSE grade C or above (or an equivalent qualification) in English language and Mathematics. Applicants without these English or mathematics qualifications at the time they apply may be considered, but they must obtain them, or pass an equivalent test set by King's, before the course starts. NOTE: This   course is very competitive so for guidance on making the strongest application   - and also for resources to self-assess and refresh your Latin translation skills -  see our Classics PGCE FAQs .
