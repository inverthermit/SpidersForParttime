ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Candidates should have a first class or upper second class (2:1) honours degree (or the equivalent from an overseas university). We may consider candidates with a lower second class degree or with professional qualifications from a recognised institution if they can show relevant work experience and/or relevant professional qualifications, can demonstrate that they are highly motivated and have referees from their university or employment strongly supporting their admission onto a masters level programme. In these circumstances we will usually admit a student to our certificate or diploma programmes, possibly with a view to the student transferring to the masters programme if they successfully pass their first two examined subjects. Relevant professional qualifications will be taken into account.
