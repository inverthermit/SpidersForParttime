ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   The basic entry requirements are a recognised first degree of at least upper second class honours (or equivalent overseas qualification) in history, politics or a relevant discipline, eg public policy, law or social science. Evidence of achievement of an academic level comparable to at least upper second class honours standard through past studies, and where previous study, work or experience (for example, in government or NGO service) has made the applicant a suitable candidate, will also be considered.
