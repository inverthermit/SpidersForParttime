ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   Employment/work experience requirements:  You must normally be working in a practice role, which involves regular patient/client contact. The College cannot arrange clinical placements. Applicants should be working in an appropriate care setting and/or post for the duration of the programme and have a minimum two years&rsquo; clinical experience as a qualified practitioner.   Academic Requirements:  The normal entry requirement for graduate study is a Bachelor's degree with minimum 2:1 honours (or overseas equivalent).   Applicants with other backgrounds or qualifications, including those without a first degree, can be considered: if you do not meet the normal entry requirements or you have only the minimum academic standard you should pay particular attention in preparing your supporting statement and CV to ensure that you draw attention to evidence of potential success at graduate level. This might include publications, preparation of substantial reports or active participation in service development initiatives or funded research.
