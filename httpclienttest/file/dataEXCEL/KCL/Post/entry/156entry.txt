ACADEMIC ENTRY REQUIREMENTS     General entry advice   1st class or 2:1 undergraduate degree (or the equivalent from an overseas university).   We may consider candidates with a lower second class degree or with professional qualifications from a recognised institution if they can:  show relevant work experience and/or relevant professional qualifications,   demonstrate that they are highly motivated   provide referees from their university or employment strongly supporting their admission onto a masters level programme.  In these circumstances we will usually admit a student to our certificate or diploma programmes, possibly with a view to the student transferring to the master's programme if they successfully pass their first two examined subjects. Relevant professional qualifications will be taken into account.  Holders of the Diploma in Geriatric Medicine (DGM), Royal College of Physicians are exempt from 60 credits, and may therefore fast track and omit one-third of the MSc.
