  This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the history, institutions and politics of European integration since 1945. It begins by evaluating competing theories of integration that help us to explain the historical development of the EU. It then analyses the institutional framework established for managing this process and how and why it has evolved over time. The course ends by investigating the nature, development and rationale behind key EU policies &ndash; including economic and monetary union, foreign and defence policy, and justice and home affairs &ndash; as well as briefly considering the wider democratic implications of ever closer union.

  This module is about the question of what is entailed in taking a &lsquo;scientific approach&rsquo; to the study of social   political relations, with particular reference to International Relations (IR) and International Political Economy (IPE). This is not an entirely straightforward aim since social &lsquo;science&rsquo; is an essentially contested field. This has implications for research methods. Above all, methods cannot be separated from contestable assumptions about ontology (the nature of social reality) and epistemology (the nature and status of knowledge that we can have about this reality). Even those who assert that 'facts speak for themselves' do so from the point of view of particular ontological and epistemological assumptions!
At the same time, amidst this uncertainty, social scientists have to get on with their research. Given the contested and contestable nature of social science, we cannot provide a 'master solution' for this practice. Rather, this module seeks to teach students how to reflect on the merits and limitations of different forms of social-political analysis and methodology as revealed in debates in the literature about ontology and epistemology. This is so that students can choose and motivate their own approach in a reflexive and informed manner.
Hence, this module provides postgraduate students with a critical introduction to the practices and controversies of contemporary social-political analysis and to their relevance to substantive research in IR and IPE. The module identifies and critically assesses the premises behind the methodological choices social scientists make and their implications. The module begins by considering debates about the nature of the political and debates in the philosophy of social science upon which the issues ultimately hinge. These debates are then explored in more detail with reference to central ontological themes: agency and structure; the material and the ideational; power; and temporality and change. The final section of the module critically assesses social-theoretical research traditions that are central to IR and IPE, ranging from rational choice theory to postmodernism.

  The first part of the module will focus more heavily on methodology and study skills. The methodological sessions will try to help you develop your skills in such areas as conducting surveys and assessing opinion polls, analyzing different forms of primary and secondary sources, and balancing theory with empirical research. They will also look at how wider theoretical debates surrounding European identity might influence methodological approaches.
In the second part of the module there will be four thematic sessions. The thematic sessions will examine whether there is actually such a thing as a common European identity. In particular they will investigate different attempts to construct one through the exploration of a variety of case studies on issues concerning debates over citizenship, faith, state institutions, the constitution or law. A key component of these sessions will be group work, in which students can also set out their own ideas when debating concepts of European identity.

  Evaluating Public Policy introduces the theory and practice of policy evaluation.   The aim of the module is to equip students with an understanding of the challenges  that different approaches face  when attempting to evaluate public policies and the different techniques of policy evaluation that may be used to overcome these challenges.   The evaluation techniques studied include Social Experimentation, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Participatory Evaluation, Targets and Performance Measurement and Auditing.
The module aims to:
-Introduce students to the idea of policy evaluation within the context of policy process and the theoretical ideas that underpin different approaches to policy evaluation.
-To introduce students to the practical challenges that face different approaches to policy evaluation and how those challenges might be overcome.
-To ensure students have an understanding of how evaluation takes place in the contemporary world of policy making and have a sound knowledge of (what has been termed) 'the evaluative' state.
-To provide students with the knowledge, skills and techniques required for advanced critical analysis of the theory and practice of policy evaluation.

  To what extent has the EU become a unitary actor in foreign affairs with the ability to project a common interest across a range of policy areas? What influence do member states have on common policies and actions as compared to EU institutions? And how does the EU reconcile conflicts between economic, humanitarian and security goals? These are three of the central questions to be tackled by this course. It will provide you with a sound understanding of the legal basis, complexity, range and impact of the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy(ies) in a more globalised world. It will also help you distinguish and competently apply a range of theoretical approaches used to conceptualise the EU as a foreign actor and to analyse its decision-making dynamics. The course aims to advance students understanding of the EU&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses as it related to other major states, international organisations and other non-governmental actors.

  This module offers a theoretical overview of current debates about the nature and origins of globalisation and examines various aspects of the economics of global capital along with their social and political consequences. The geopolitical reconfiguration ushered in by the collapse of the Eastern Bloc will be examined in relation to the crisis of Western liberalism and the emergence of new forms of resistance to globalisation. Do such movements represent defensive &lsquo;resistance identities&rsquo; or an attempt to create new public spaces and new forms of community? The module will conclude with an assessment of the extent to which the existing literature on social movements is able to respond to such questions, followed by an examination of alternative societal models to global capitalism. Students will develop their analytical skills in coming to terms with a wide-ranging contemporary debate which engages with various key theoretical issues in the fields of economics, sociology and political science.

  The focus of this module is on the representation of interests in the European Union and their role in EU policy-making. Member States and EU institutions are not the only influential actors in European Union policy-making. A number of other organized interests make their presence felt &ndash; usually behind the scenes &ndash; in EU politics and policies. These actors range from pan-European trade associations and regional governments to lawyers, consultants, and multinational companies. Their presence increased with the expansion of responsibilities and membership of the European Union. The module examines the nature of organised interests in the EU and why their influence as lobbyists has increased over time in the EU policy-making process. The module also considers how the EU institutions have responded to lobbying &ndash; a process which is now an integral part of EU decision-making.

  This module is designed to introduce students to the most influential contemporary debates on the role of political parties in European political systems and on their recent transformations in the framework of European integration. It will also examine the causes of Europe&rsquo;s growing political instability and crisis of representation, as expressed by phenomena such as the rising turnover of parties in government, low turnouts, emergence of &ldquo;incomers&rdquo; (radical forces from either right or left) in almost all party systems. The module will not focus on single parties or party systems, but will rather analyze political parties in comparative perspective. More specifically, the first part of the module will first focus on the main theoretical approaches to understand political parties (elite theories, political market approaches, catch-all, mass, electoral-professional and cartel-party models). The second part of the module will analyze in detail recent changes in party organizations (membership, leadership selection, party finance and regulation) party ideology (party families, anti-system parties, cartelization) and the &lsquo;Europeanization&rsquo; of political parties (understood both as the impact of the EU on the national party systems and the consolidation of political parties at the EU level).

  Bright ideas do not necessarily make good research. It is equally wrong to assume that data speak for themselves, thus constituting a sufficient condition for conducting research in social sciences. Rather, bright ideas and sound evidence are better conceived as necessary but not sufficient conditions for conducting high-quality research in social science. Within this context, research methods can be seen as the bridge allowing to link theoretical considerations and empirical material, sometimes pushing the researcher to downscale her ambitions, some others opening up unforeseen avenues for research. Starting from this consideration on the role of methods in social sciences, this module aims to provide students with a thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the main research methods they are likely to employ when conducting research in social science.
The module is structured into two parts, focusing respectively on the key debates in the philosophy of social science and on the discussion of the main research methods, with a final two-hour workshop at the end of the module where students are asked to think through the methodological components of their end-of-year dissertation.

  The on-going conflict in Ukraine and Europe&rsquo;s consequent rounds of sanctions against the Russian economy underline the international relevance of EU-Russian relations This module provides students with a detailed and extensive coverage of the major events, economic and political contours and challenges which define the field of EU-Russia relations, including trade, cooperation (particularly the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in force since 1997), migration, human rights and governance, energy security, defence and foreign policy and key territorial issues such as the status of the Kaliningrad Oblast, and the future of Ukraine. The module will also provide students with an overall sense of the vectors driving Russian foreign policy towards Europe, and the contents and priorities informing the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy, and economic outlook towards what is arguably its most strategic neighbour to the East.

  The relationship between the EU and Asia is one of the key drivers of developments in the international system. Whereas in the past relations between these two regions were driven by economics, today political and security calculations are equally central to understand the dynamics of their interactions. This module addresses the relationship between the EU and Asia by looking at their relations at the regional level, as well as by analysing bilateral relations between the EU and key Asian countries. Particular attention will be given to how developments in the international system affect EU-Asia interactions and to how these interactions impact international relations. Special emphasis will also be put on the role of the USA in shaping the EU&rsquo;s and Asian countries&rsquo; respective policies towards each other.

  At least formally, Britain&rsquo;s membership in the European Union is a fraught one. At the same time, there are few states that have been as committed to integrated world market as the British one and the European Union forms an important part of this commitment. This module is about understanding the nature of the relationship between Britain and the EU, how this has endured or changed over time, and what the determinants of this relationship might be.

  The theoretical aim of the module is, first, to understand the problem of migration, both legal and illegal, in the context of globalisation; and, second, to assess the relation between globalisation, marginalisation and the EU response to threats of mass immigration from less developed countries. The Unit therefore focuses on the following theoretical questions:
How is the process of globalisation related to the increase of migratory flows from less developed countries to Western ones?
What are the main political and economic causes and consequences of migration, in general, and illegal migration, in particular?
Is there tension between legal and illegal migration?

  The financial crisis that started 2007 in the American subprime mortgage market casts a long shadow over the global political economy, and no doubt its future will be marked by the management of this crisis. But understanding the crisis and its consequences is far from straightforward, and requires careful consideration of history and competing analytical frameworks as offered by this module. Concluding sessions draw on such understanding to assess current crisis management at the global level and in the Eurozone.
