  What is modernity? How is it tied to the European Enlightenment and its concepts of religion, culture and secularism? And how do Jews respond to these questions? How did they define, interpret and shape modernity? In this course we will explore key issues in the modern Jewish world (nation, religion and citizenship &ndash; education and cultural integration &ndash; variations of secularism &ndash; affiliation and disaffiliation); we will analyse them within their historical contexts and in view of current theoretical inquiries; and we will deepen our understanding of them by studying specific situations, in which the visibility or invisibility of religious difference was negotiated (eg in debates on language, dress, architecture and the role of museums in the city). The course offers an introduction to major trends and innovative approaches in current research. While Western Europe and its urban centres will form our starting point, we will look at a broad range of Jewish perspectives on religious difference in public space, on the relationship between religion and culture, and on the role of gender in defining the public and private spheres. Eventually, students will be able to develop competent and creative approaches to current debates on religion, culture and the public space, taking into consideration the diversity and complexity of Jewish responses to the challenges and promises of our modern multireligious societies.

  The aim of this module is to provide an in-depth historical analysis of the origin and development of the Arab-Israeli conflict from its onset in the early 20th century to the present day.
More specifically, it provides an introduction to the primary literature and the historiographical debate surrounding the creation of the State of Israel, the collapse and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society, and the ongoing conflict between Arabs and Jews over the Holy Land.
The course begins with a broad survey of Jewish and Arab/Muslim history in Palestine in general, and since the late 19th century in particular. It then looks at the impact of the British mandate on Arab-Jewish relations and its culmination in the establishment of the State of Israel and the collapse and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society, before proceeding to explore the successive Arab attempts to reverse the consequences of the 1948 war, or the Naqba (the catastrophe) as it is known in Arab parlance, against the backdrop of regional and global developments. Finally the course discusses the various peace initiatives over the past six decades and assesses the chances of attaining this cherished goal.

  This module introduces key themes in the thought of some of the most influential Jewish philosophers of the 20th century, including Buber, Rosenzweig, Levinas, and Soloveitchik. We will focus particularly on the theme of 'inter-subjectivity', examining each thinker's understanding of selfhood and the ethical relation, and contrasting the dialogical approach to inter-subjectivity with Sartre's view that 'hell is other people'. No prior knowledge of philosophy, except for material introduced on the Methods and Foundations course, is required.

  Intermarriage is a contentious issue in contemporary Judaism, but do we know how the early rabbis felt about intermarriage? What were their attitudes and how did they perceive it? Through detailed study of narrative (aggadic) and legal (halakhic) midrashim from a variety of sources, we will explore the complicated and often conflicted rabbinic relationship with the issue of intermarriage. Issues under consideration will include dating of sources, intertextuality, the use of prooftexts, and the relationship between exegetical methodology and the attitude of the exegete. By engaging with rabbinic responses to a variety of biblical stories and laws on intermarriage, students will gain a familiarity with and fluency in a wide range of midrashic sources in addition to a deeper understanding of the complexity of the rabbinic engagement with the issue of intermarriage. Students will have the opportunity to apply the skills in reading, translation and analysis gained in this course to a topic of their own choosing.

  This module will explore major events and themes of Jewish life during a period of some thirteen centuries (4th to 16th) when the fate of the Jewish people depended on interaction with dominant Christian powers. We will analyze the forces leading toward tolerance and intolerance in the major religious traditions of Christianity as they interacted with political interests of the leadership classes. Special attention will be paid to the specific contours of Jewish experience in medieval and early modern Christian Europe, including critical events and texts, interaction of minority and majority communities, mutual conceptions of the Other.

  The contemporary plight of the Agunah, the woman who is trapped in her marriage and unable to obtain a divorce or remarry, has its roots in the legal nature of Jewish marriage, or kiddushin. Jewish communities today are grappling with these problems in Jewish marriage and divorce in a variety of ways, including creating prenuptial agreements, enacting changes in civil law, pressuring recalcitrant husbands, and changing or completely transforming the marriage ceremony. Through readings in Tractate Kiddushin of the Babylonian Talmud, this course will explore the legal structure of kiddushin, as well as its social and cultural contexts in the various Jewish communities of the time.

  The Babylonian Talmud is well known for its inclusion of a large amount of aggadic or narrative material in the midst of the sea of law. These stories are often funny or shocking, but they are more than mere entertainment. Much of the aggadic material is subversive in nature, rejecting, mocking, overturning or exploding the established halakhah. Most interesting of these are the stories told of individuals seeking a legal judgement from the greatest of Sages, symbolic expressions of the impact of the halakhah on the lives of real people as well as of the law in practice rather than in theory.
