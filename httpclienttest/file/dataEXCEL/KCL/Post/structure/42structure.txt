  As an MRes the major focus of the programme is giving students the opportunity to learn how to do research. The proposed course is structured to be a 30 credits taught module, and two 75 credit laboratory based research project modules (the practice of research), giving an integrated background experience of research strategy, context and practical experience. 
The taught component will consist of lectures in the 1st semester; (see the attached Timetable Translational Cancer Medicine.xls), literature review/journal clubs (once a month, at the individual laboratory or department that the student is attached to) and workshops on relevant topics such as biostatistics, drug design, etc. From the outset, students will be expected to start working four days a week on their Research Project. 
For the taught module, there will be a written assignment on the overall concept of Translational Cancer Research e.g. &ldquo;The essential building blocks for good translational cancer research&rdquo; &ndash; this can be centred on examples in the two main disciplines which the two lab rotations represent, with &lsquo;links&rsquo; to other relevant disciplines that are taught within the module. 

  
    Translational Cancer Medicine Laboratory Rotation 1 - Required

  The Research project (Laboratory Rotation 1) will be assessed by a written dissertation, a seminar presentation and an oral examination. The written report will cover a detailed background introduction to the subject together with a presentation of results and discussion of the research undertaken.  
  
    Translational Cancer Medicine Laboratory Rotation 2 - Required

  The Research project (Laboratory Rotation 2) will be assessed by a written paper of the standard and format required by a scientific journal [the two supervisors for the two lab rotations may agree to put in data from parts of the two rotations together for this paper].
