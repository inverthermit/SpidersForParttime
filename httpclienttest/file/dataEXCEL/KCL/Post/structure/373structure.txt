  This module examines the way that the environment is understood within the context of development, focusing on the global South. It explores the importance of the environment and natural resources to the development process, and the legacy of colonialism and underdevelopment in framing environmental problems. Finally the module considers recent shifts in the debates surrounding development and the environment initiated under both economic restructuring (the so-called Washington Consensus) since the 1980s, and the increasing attention to global environmental problems, including biodiversity and climate change.

  This module enables students to derive a greater understanding of the relationship between methodology and method and the related notions of epistemology and ontology. The module is a mix of lectures and tutorials and enables students to develop skills in the appropriate use and application of quantitative and qualitative methods, which will have been worked through in tutorial sessions. The module lays the conceptual groundwork for the design of the dissertation and enables students to appreciate the connections between epistemology and the students particular programme of study.

  After charting the growth and development of tourism at a global level and also within countries of the South, the module adopts an analytical approach, examining the impact of power relations and risk on tourism development at different scales in developing countries. It examines the different roles played by different interest groups in the industry and the inter-relationship between these groups. It analyses the advantages and disadvantages of tourism on economies of the South and examines possible ways of bringing theory and practice in tourism together in the pursuit of socio-economic development.

  This module aims to enable students to understand the social construction of vulnerability to natural hazards at the micro level; appreciate the theoretical and empirical links between the reduction of disaster risk at micro level and issues of development at the local and international scale; facilitate understanding by students of the linkages between household and individual vulnerability and livelihoods in the local and macro economy; develop a critical awareness of the role of development failures in local patterns of human vulnerability and disaster risk and encourage critical reflection on the management of disasters through humanitarian action and disaster risk reduction approaches, especially the linkages between scales.

  This module aims to provide students with training in critical social science with which to examine the causes of natural disaster associated with climate change and other extreme events and the ways in which natural disaster risk and recovery are managed. The module exposes students to vulnerability and capacity assessment methodologies, and management approaches including community based risk management. There is a particular, but not exclusive focus on Africa, Asia and Latin America. Theoretically the module draws from the political ecology of disaster and hazardscapes work.

  This module starts with a focus on meanings, approaches, and debates resolving around sustainable livelihoods and development from various perspectives. Thematic exemplars will involve in-depth coverage of current issues, such as fair trade, agrarian change, and natural resources management. There will also be focus on discourses of participation and community in development as it pertains to macro- and micro-level implications. This will be linked to broader debates about gendered livelihoods and gender-development debates. The module will involve in-class discussions, based on assigned readings that students are expected to read, as well as documentary analyses linked to the practical coursework assessment.

  The module enables students to adopt a critical approach to the relationships between the environment, agricultural production and change and political ecology in southern Africa. It covers the agricultural and environmental characteristics of the southern African region, including both the small-scale and large-scale agricultural sectors, and the discourses and debates about how these should be interpreted and analysed.  It provides a strong appreciation of how structural factors such as land alienation and migrancy influence contemporary agricultural performance, and the significance of indigenous knowledge and the limitations of technocratic solutions.  The module also addresses critically the philosophy behind, and empirical outcomes of, CBNRM approaches in a region rich in wildlife and national parks.
  
    Tourism And The Environment - Optional

 The module aims to critically explore the politics and practices of &lsquo;ecotourism&rsquo;. It draws on diverse work in social theory, political ecology and related approaches to outline a range of critical lenses for approaching ecotourism. The potential of these critical lenses is illustrated through investigations of key issues in ecotourism, which are grounded in examples of ecotourism in practice in Spain, Mexico, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.

  This module enables students to evaluate the way in which globalization (in the form mainly of structural adjustment programmes) has influenced African cities and contemporary livelihoods and economic strategies (employment, incomes, food and shelter) for the majority of Africa's urban population, the urban poor. Assessing urban growth patterns in this region and its periodization and the changing nature of rural-urban migration and linkages over time. The constraints on planning and servicing imposed by extreme resource constraints and the privatization encouraged by structural adjustment are evaluated. The module also explores the specificities of the urban experience in southern African countries with their legacies of institutionalised and racially-based influx control.

  This module provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the recent history of water resource allocation and management especially in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Priority will be given to outlining a conceptual framework identifying the relevant underlying ecological, economic and sociological principles relevant in the evaluation and management of water resources. The conceptual framework will also show the link between these underlying principles and environmental and economic policies. The roles of the institutions and technologies through which such policies can be implemented will also be analysed and exemplified.
