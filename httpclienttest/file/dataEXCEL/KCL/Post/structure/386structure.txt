Taught through a series of linked lectures and workshops, it combines an examination of significant debates in the study of the history of war from the medieval period to the present day with practical workshops on the broad variety of sources, methods and issues central to the study of warfare in the past. Its portfolio assessment, comprising a book review, an individual research project and a personal statement reflecting on their work, is designed to allow students to develop and practice the skills of the research historian. Particular attention is paid to developing students' critical engagement with source material, and the nature and limitations of historical knowledge.

Aims:
To develop an appreciation of the study of war in the past and of its relationship to other historical research and cognate disciplines.
To provide a systematic introduction to the historiographical and methodological debates at the forefront of the discipline.
To develop the analytical and practical skills required to create and interpret knowledge in the field of the history of warfare.
To encourage critical engagement with historical sources and originality of thought on the basis of primary research.
  
Learning outcomes:
By the end of the module, students will have demonstrated:
An ability to evaluate critically scholarly research in the field to the standard of a professional book review.
An ability to engage critically with the intellectual approaches and methodologies adopted on a chosen theme.

    Full-year     
   
    
  
      Assessment:  
      coursework     
      The module will be assessed in two distinct ways:
Sixty per cent (60%) of marks will be based on one 3,000 word essay. This essay will allow students to explore specific themes raised during the module and develop the capacity for specialisation and focused research.
Forty per cent (40%) of marks will be based on one 2,000 word practical case study. Students will develop a collection strategy and conduct preliminary analysis on a topic to be agreed in advance with the course convenors.

     
  The role of open source intelligence (OSINT) has assumed increasing prominence in intelligence communities since the end of the Cold War, largely as a result of the prolific growth of OSINT sources as a result of the rapid spread of worldwide use of the Internet. This module will cover thoroughly both theoretical and practical aspects of OSINT, including OSINT collection, analysis and management methodologies. The latter will be addressed by the application of OSINT by students to study varied case studies in two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises.
This module will appeal most strongly to students taking the MA in Intelligence and International Security. However, it is anticipated that in line with the commitment of the Department of War Studies to the inter-disciplinary study of war, the module will appeal also to students on the whole range of existing MA programmes and contribute to their respective learning outcomes.
Aims:
This module aims to provide students with:
an understanding of the history, theory and use of OSINT;
a critical understanding of the difference between collection and analysis of OSINT;
specialised knowledge of the methods of collection and analysis of OSINT;
a framework for applying these methods to two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises;
practical experience of the application of these methods in both individual and group contexts;
and an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of these methods.

Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to carry out the following:
plan and organise substantial OSINT projects;
conduct highly advanced internet research, including the identification of rich sources of information, and the evaluation of the reliability and utility of sources;
synthesise information from a range of sources, using the full variety of source formats (including hard copy and verbal communications in addition to online sources);
perform a number of methods and modes of analysis;
select these methods for use according to their suitability for collected sources;
and to assess critically the theoretical rigour of their OSINT work.

  Drawing upon a range of historical and contemporary case studies, the course provides a comparative and empirically informed examination of the origins, characteristics and dynamics of civil wars. It explores competing theories about the causes of civil wars and is concerned with the difficulties of bringing such wars to an end. Special attention is given to the role of international organisations, international law and outside military intervention in the mitigation, regulation and resolution of contemporary civil wars. The case studies examined include the Spanish Civil War (1936-39); the Angolan (1974-2001) and Mozambican (1977-1992) civil wars; Liberia and Sierra Leone (1991-2001); Iraq (2004-2007); Lebanon (1965-90); the Balkans (1991-95) and Syria (2011-).
The aims of the module are to provide:
a conceptual framework in which to understand the place of civil war and internal conflict in contemporary international relations;
an understanding, informed by historical and contemporary cases studies, of how civil wars start, spread, mutate and are brought to an end;
an understanding of how international organisations, international law, mediation and foreign intervention have influenced the course of civil wars;
an appreciation of the policy challenges and dilemmas generated by the persistence of civil war in the international system.

      Just as the best test of a student&rsquo;s grasp of academic scholarship is to ask the student to make his or her own small contribution in the form of an essay or dissertation, so the best test of your understanding of the salient features of conflict simulation is to ask you to design a small simulation of your own. Hence, your mark for this course depends entirely on your individual simulation project, the final version of which must be handed in by noon on Monday May 2nd (the start of the 3rd term). The project must meet the specification in all respects if it is to be accepted for assessment.
     
  All prospective students should be sure to consult this site and the associated websites for Professor Sabin&rsquo;s two latest books, to ensure that you understand what this unusual and innovative course involves.

You should also consult http://www.professionalwargaming.co.uk/
 for more on Professor Sabin&acute;s role in promoting and assisting with the use of conflict simulation by military forces and defence analysts in the UK and overseas. You must be aware up front that the course is a lot of work and can take significantly more time than other courses, though past students have found it commensurately engaging and rewarding.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVESThis option course builds on a corpus of material hitherto almost entirely neglected within War Studies curricula, namely the several thousand conflict simulation board games published in recent decades which attempt to model the dynamics of past or potential campaigns. The aims of the course are as follows:
to familiarise students with the various possible mechanisms of conflict simulation, and the strengths and weaknesses of each;
to allow students to create their own original simulation of a particular historical campaign or battle of their choice;
to use simulation and modelling to encourage students to analyse the key dynamics of conflict situations, thereby gaining greater insight into the physical and human determinants of conflict;
to help develop a wide range of skills, including critical appraisal of existing simulations, detailed historical research into a specific campaign, intellectual creativity in devising and testing simulation models, legalistic clarity and precision in drafting simulation rules, and design skills in producing simulation graphics;
to allow students to practise broader transferable skills, in particular team work in a variety of contexts, familiarity with handling computer graphics, and the use of the internet to find information, disseminate ideas and receive feedback from the wider simulation community.

  
    Conflict, Culture and the Postcolonial in International Relations - Optional

  Are contemporary conflicts in the so-called 'South' and interventionist wars manifestations of late modern modes of colonisation and global relations of power? Are race and cultural difference elements that should be taken into account in our understandings of the discourses, practices, and institutions of international politics?
Postcolonial authors highlight the constitutive relationship between colonial domination and modernity. The challenge of a postcolonial reading of the international is its revelation of the Eurocentric particularity of the universal subject of politics, and the relationship between racial and cultural difference and systems of power/knowledge. The aim in this module is to engage with the literature in postcolonial social and political thought, focusing in particular on the continuities of the colonial legacy in late modern practices of conflict, structures of domination, and modes of resistance in global politics.
The aims of the module are:
- To provide students with the capacity to engage critically with the universalising categories associated with theorising the international, relating conceptions of subjectivity to cultural difference and frameworks of knowledge.
- To engage students with key concepts and critiques deriving from postcolonial readings of global politics, including sovereignty, modernity, subjectivity, power, and resistance.
- To develop students' capacity for critique, specifically in relation to traditional understandings of the relationship between 'North' and 'South'.
- To enable reflection on the implications of the colonial legacy in understanding the international and what constitutes knowledge, facticity, and method in social and political thinking related to international relations.
- To develop students' appreciation of the postcolonial critique through an engagement with the primary voices that have influenced postcolonial thinking in International Relations and across the disciplines.
- To focus on issues relating to race and cultural difference and how these relate to conflict, structures of domination, and resistance in late modern conditions in global politics.
- To engage with the question of race and the modern state.
- To highlight the so-called 'woman question' and its place in the colonial legacy and continuities in practices of domination to the present.
- To juxtapose modern conceptions of subjectivity with the colonial, the postcolonial and subaltern.
- To enable reflection on late modern interventionist practices and the place of race and culture as constitutive moments in these practices.

By the end of the module, students will:
- Have the capacity to engage critically with the postcolonial literature, and specifically with postcolonial understandings of international politics.
- Have the intellectual tools necessary to critically draw upon the postcolonial challenge as this relates to the conceptual, theoretical, and philosophical understandings of the international.
- Have the skills to design a research project focusing on the themes of the module.
- Be able to reflect upon the relationship between coloniality and modernity and its implications for the postcolonial experience as this relates to questions of sovereignty and self-determination.
- Reflect upon the relationship between contemporary manifestations of conflict, interventionist warfare and the colonial legacy.
- Be able to engage with gender, the colonial legacy, and the postcolonial experience, as well as the so-called 'woman question' and the politics of racial and cultural difference.
- Be able to conduct research on and reflect on race and cultural difference and how these relate to conflict, structures of domination, and resistance in late modern conditions in global politics.
- Be able to reflect upon questions of political subjectivity, specifically in relation to the modern, the colonial and the postcolonial.
- To engage critically with primary voices in the postcolonial literature and their contributions to our understanding of identity, cultural diversity, power, and the politics of representations.
- To articulate a postcolonial understanding of the state, globalisation, and modes of resistance.

  British Defence Policy has been going through an unprecedented period of operational challenge in the last few years and particularly in the last half dozen years. Until the launch of the previous Government's Defence Review in September 2009 there had been very little discussion of the direction and shape of British defence policy outside of the Ministry of Defence and the armed services. Decisions with enormous implications for future generations have been taken with little or no public engagement with the debates. As casualties have risen in Iraq and Afghanistan a campaign to draw attention to the pay and conditions of service personnel and their families has re-opened a debate on the concept of a military covenant between the state and the armed forces which continues. At the same time defence policy has begun to be seen as a component of a broader National Security Strategy with significant implications for future funding models and modes of delivery.
  
While the current preoccupation is on on-going operational commitments in the Middle East and Central Asia, significant problems in equipment procurement continue to dog the British defence establishment with claims of enormous gaps in the defence budget provision for existing equipment programmes and future requirements. The Government has embarked upon a 'strategic defence and security review' which is due to report in he autumn of 2010. This module will consider these and other issues in the historical context of British defence policy and in light of current debates.
  
Aims:
This aims of the  module are to:
- provide a framework for understanding and analysing the formulation and delivery of defence policy in the UK;
- foster the skills required for analysis of the various influences on defence policy formulation;
- develop a comprehensive appreciation of the relationship between government, the military and commercial organisations in the delivery of defence capability;
- highlight how commercial calculations affects political decisions and public discourse; and,
- promote an understanding of the impact of new technology on the future of British defence policy.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to demonstrate:
- an understanding of the key issues facing current British defence policy makers;
- a critical engagement in the methodological questions associated with the study of defence policy making;
- an understanding of the historical context of existing defence policy;
- the ability to evaluate the conflicting pressures on the armed services; and,
- an ability to engage critically with the literature on the subject, to undertake independent research and to exercise informed judgement on current security issues.

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security and is also available as an options module to students on other MA programmes in the Department. The purpose of the module is to examine a variety of issues in international politics where scientific and technological issues intersect with security concerns. We focus on three broad topics: missile defense and the prospect of an arms race in space; the environment as a security threat, and the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements. For each of these topics, we gain an understanding of the science involved, examine relevant social science theories and concepts, and then use these tools to anlayse the policy issues involved, with a focus on the interaction of science and politics.
Aims:
The aims of the module are to:
- familiarise students with the basic science underlying important contemporary issues in international politics
- develop a systematic understanding of the relevant concepts and theories from Security Studies, and encourage a critical awareness of the theoretical and empirical debates surrounding them
- promote the capacity for critical evaluation, independent judgment and communication at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
- foster the skills required for critical analysis of the implications of scientific and technological developments on security
- provide a framework for original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific developments in shaping security problems

Learning outcomes:

By the end of the module, students will have:
- a basic understanding of the science underlying contemporary issues in international politics
- the ability to analyse critically technical claims made in the field of international security
- an ability to provide politically-informed technical analysis in the field of science and security
- critically engaged with key concepts and theories used in security studies, and applied those concepts and theories to an analysis of current and historical security issues
- carried out original, critical analysis of the impact of scientific and technological developments on security, using knowledge of the science involved and tools drawn from IR theory and security studies
- practised a range of intellectual, practical and transferable skills, through participation in classes and through the preparation and submission of course work

  The detailed substance of the course will focus inter alia on topics such as the following: diplomacy and intelligence; military diplomacy; summitry; mediation; the role of diplomacy in multilateral forums. Students will be encouraged to make use of case studies to illustrate general propositions about diplomatic theory and practice.

Aims:
This module will examine the theory, art and practice of diplomacy, both as an instrument of foreign policy and an institution in the international system.
It will analyse the way in which diplomacy, unlike most other aspects of international life, emphasises that which states have in common as well as those things which divide them.
It will study diplomacy from the perspectives of politics, international law and history.
In addition to this, it will look at the roles and functions of diplomacy regarding states and their policies, as well as the conduct of diplomacy in different forums and in different collective activities.

Learning Outcomes:
At the end of the module, students should have:
An understanding of topics such as the following: diplomacy and intelligence; coercive diplomacy; summitry; mediation; the role of diplomacy in multilateral forums; diplomacy in the post Cold War and Post 9/11 worlds;
Made use of case studies to illustrate general propositions about diplomatic theory and practice;
A clearer understanding of the role of diplomacy as an institution in international society, its civilising influence and the extent to which its norms and conventions can be regarded as appropriate and effective in an age of globalisation, and new security threats.

      coursework     
      Assessment will be by means of two written submissions. The first will consist of a 1500 word book review (or similar exercise) which will contribute 20% to the final mark for the module as a whole. The second will be an essay of 4000 words which will contribute the remaining 80% of the mark for the module as a whole. The pass mark for both pieces of work is set at 50%.
     
  This is a research based option which flows from the work conducted by Professor Frost in the field of Ethics in International Relations. The impetus for this research came from the neglect which the discipline of IR has traditionally shown towards issues to do with ethics in world politics. The central claim developed and defended in this option is that no coherent understanding of contemporary international affairs is possible without a serious and sustained engagement with a core set of ethical issues. Such engagement with ethical thought and argument is required for us to make sense of any of the following actions: actions in defence of state sovereignty, wars of national liberation, new wars, secession, humanitarian interventions, the global war against terror, international crime, international aid, development aid, and national self-determination. In recent years IR scholars have gradually paid more attention to the link between ethics and explanation in world politics. This module will introduce students to some of the key debates which have emerged in the burgeoning field of contemporary normative international relations theory.
Course Aims and ObjectivesThis module will engage students in a research based programme built around the core text written by the convenor entitled Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom and International Relations (Routledge, 2008), but will also refer to his other books, Constituting Human Rights (Routledge, 2002), Ethics in International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1996) and Towards a Normative Theory of International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1986). It also aims to engage students with the articles reprinted in Mervyn Frost (ed), International Ethics (Volumes 1- 4) (London, Sage Library of International Relations, 2011)
It will immerse students in an in-depth, historically informed study of the place of ethics in the discipline of International Relations paying particular attention to the reasons for its neglect in main stream International Relations theory as it developed in the 20th century
This option will acquaint students with the traditional literature that did take ethical issues in international affairs seriously prior to the advent of modern social scientific method in the discipline. They will consider why this body of literature was submerged by the rise of positivist social scientific approaches to IR.
It will explore the ways in which ethical matters impinge on the study of world affairs in spite of the sustained attempts by scholars to make a sharp distinction between facts and values in order to sustain the claim the IR is a scientific discipline.
It will discuss the social scientific difficulties we encounter when studying human actions (which is the material studied by IR theorists) and how these difficulties inevitably lead social scientist to engage with profound ethical issues.
Students will be lead to discover the salience of the above for our understanding and explanation of all key policy areas in international affairs from trade policy to war making.
A key aim is to teach students how to move beyond merely pointing out the salience of ethical considerations to what they do as IR scholars, to actually engaging in argument to move towards a solution of some of the pressing ethical issues of our time in the international sphere. They will be required usefully to engage with questions to do with sovereignty, just war theory, normative theories about new wars, the ethical issues produced by the global &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;, global governance, democratization, the advancement of freedom by global civil society, human rights in a world of states, and others.
Students will be invited to discuss a range of core texts by contemporary political philosophers working in this area including the work of John Rawls, Michael Walzer, Terry Nardin, Charles Beitz, Mervyn Frost, Chris Brown and others.

  Human Rights and Migration adopts a socio-legal approach to questions relating migration and human rights. In doing do, it stresses the significance of political context in the construction of legal frameworks dealing with the politically charged question of the movement of peoples across national boundaries and examines these in relation to the agencies and institutions of the European Union. Each session considers the theoretical issue relating to human rights and migration, how the question is dealt with in international treaties, and what the implications are for migrants.
  
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
To promote in students an advanced understanding of the relationship between human rights law and the movement of people across national boundaries.  The focus throughout will be on the interrelationships both supportive and conflictual between the domestic law within states dealing with migration, EU law and International Law.
Unpack the international legal framework in relation to contemporary ethical ideas about individual identity, belonging and citizenship.  This will involve students moving beyond "black letter" law to a study of the ethical values which underpin it.
Set out the legal framework governing the refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union as they were originally set up and the transformations which have been taking place in the post Cold War and in the globalizing environment. 
Expose students to cutting edge analyses which examine the political forces influencing the legal changes mentioned in point 3 above
Explore the ways in which forced migration is being dealt with in national and international law.Make explicit the opportunities which exist in domestic, EU and International law for migrants to seek remedies which will protect their fundamental human rights in the face of hostile political forces.  In doing this detailed consideration will be given to recent developments in the case law pertaining to these matters.
Study the links between human rights law, family law and migration.
Explore the economic outcomes of migration and how it has affected human rights law.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:
Relate concepts of human rights to the   movement of peoples across national boundaries as these have been defined   in and controlled by law.
Specify the   complex legal framework within which our modern ideas of identity, belonging,   and citizenship are located.
Understand the legal framework relating to   refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union and the   transformations taking place therein.    In doing this students will be able to demonstrate an ability to   find their way around a complicated knowledge base which includes law   reports, constitutions, legal text books, works in the field of   international relations and also reports in the quality press.
Appreciate the political context surrounding   the complex relationship between human rights and migration policies   within the European context.
Engage with some of the thorny ethical issues   which are raised by the legal and political disputes surrounding the   problems of migration.
Understand and analyse the issue of forced   migration and the protection of refugees under international human rights   law.
Understand the question of rights and how this   relates to family life across national boundaries.Assess the impact of economic migration on   human rights law
Demonstrate skill in articulating the complex   interrelationships between law, politics and ethics as they pertain to   issues to do with migration across national borders.  These skills are likely to prove useful   to students in their subsequent careers and as citizens.

  Aims: To foster the capacity for critical analysis of insecurity, risk, and unease, developing students' capacity for independent judgement and communication at a level commensurate with postgraduate study.
To develop an interdisciplinary approach towards questions of security, war, policing, and risk, adding to the traditional knowledge of International Relations concerning these domains, central highlights coming from political theory, history, cultural anthropology, criminology, political sociology, surveillance studies. 
To address the relationship between policing (criminal justice, intelligence, and risk assessment) and defence (war making, antiterrorist operations abroad and peace support operation) as a set of entangled practices whose boundaries are shifting with forms of policing abroad and military intelligence surveillance inside.
To  discuss the boundaries of the networks constituted by different professionals and experts of (in)security at the transnational scale and is based on a deep empirical research concerning the European Union and its transatlantic relations
To connect to International Relations theories (mainly anglo-american) a line of thought coming from French and continental theorists and sociologists, often misread as post-modern, like Bruno Latour, Ulrich Beck, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu, and tries to show how they can be operationalised methodologically for empirical research concerning (in)security
Helps students understand the relationship between agents and institutions relating to (in)security within the European Union and beyond.
Addresses the impact of these networks of (in)security professionals at the transnational scale on the capacity of the professionals of politics at the national level and within the EU context to govern effectively. 
Discusses the emergence of transnational professional guilds which destabilises the very notion of national government and national state.
Opens a discussion about contemporary dynamics of social changes seen often as globalisation, and to their relations with order, equality and freedom.
Enables also students' capacity to analyse the dynamics at works concerning (in)security, risk and unease in other different social and professional universes, including beyond coercive agents, the domains of health, environment, banking, through a reconceptualisation of what (in)security practices means and what they do.
Learning outcomes:
By the end of the  module students will be able to
Relate the theoretical and conceptual debates on security and insecurity to wider theoretical and conceptual frameworks. 
Understand of the qualities and limits of contemporary International Relations theories on this subject. 
Understand better the significance of issues raised in the module in relation to wider methodological concerns, and learn from the module how to engage in empirical research while having a background of constructivist epistemology. 
Appreciate the normative dimension of the study of (in)security regarding freedom, equality and justice, and have the capacity to understand the ethical dilemmas surrounding the (in)security dynamics.

  
    International Politics Of The Middle East - Optional

  The module explores the emergence and evolution of the Middle East system of states and its international politics since 1945, through a framework of analysis that is partly historical and partly thematic. The module is heavily based on reading seminars through which the themes discussed in lectures are explored, often in relation to current case studies. You will be expected to read an average of 140-150 pages a week. The lectures start with a survey of the emergence of the modern Middle East since the late Ottoman period, through the era of British and French imperialism, to the post-1945 independence period and the Cold War and post-Cold War eras. This is intended to demonstrate the importance of the international system in shaping the modern states and political patterns of the region, and also to reveal the importance of social structures and political economy in additionally determining inter-state behaviour. This perspective is applied to the rise of nationalism, impact of oil, and pressures to liberalize economically and politically, especially since the end of the Cold War. Sweeping social and economic transformation has moreover led to the rise of new forms of 'identity politics' that are explored in the cases of religious-nationalist Zioism and of political Islam, and to the increasing role of armed non-state actors. These themes are developed through extensive discussion of select case-studies including Iraq, Iran, and Israel and the Palestinians. The primary aim is to provide a basic ability to analyze and understand major political issues and historical processes in the Middle East. The secondary aim is to provide training in the critical reading of assigned texts and their use in analytical writing.
Aims
The aims of the module are to:
enhance student knowledge of the determinants of modern Middle East politics and state formation;
provide an analytical framework for understanding the Arab-Israeli and Gulf conflicts, intra-regional relations, the politics of oil, and the Middle East policies of the super/global powers;
allow students to develop their understanding of the role of identity politics (nationalism and religion) in inter-state politics in the region;
allow students to develop their understanding of the politics of economic and political liberalization in the Middle East in the context of globalization;
encourage critical engagement with debates about the applicability and utility of different International Relations theoretical approaches in explaining the international politics of the Middle East.
  
Learning outcomes
At the end of the module, students will be able to:
interpret and explain events in the Middle East through application of universal analytical concepts and methods;
assess critically the impact of global processes on Middle East politics, and equally to draw on the example of the Middle East to re-evaluate the international politics of other regions of the world;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the levels-of-analysis approach, questions of causality, and critical comparative perspective in International Relations thinking, including the interplay of external and internal factors in the national, regional, and international politics of states;
explain the relevance of social origins, historical context, and political economy of states to their foreign policy behaviour, affecting the nature, extent, and pace of regionalism, economic and political liberalization, and globalization;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the role of ideology and culture in international politics;
communicate effectively about these issues verbally and in writing;display research skills pertinent to the study of international politics of the Middle East.

  The public's 'right to know' and the government's need for secrecy in its military and counter-terrorism operations characterise the core problem in the relationship between governments and media in liberal democracies. This module explores an even more tenuous relationship by focusing on the tensions as well as interdependencies between the intelligence and the journalistic communities. It explores the role media products play as an 'open source' in the intelligence cycle, how intelligence services 'use' the media to influence public perceptions and, finally, how journalists report &ndash; or fail to report &ndash; the activities of intelligence services. It will also critically reflect on the impact of New Media on the intelligence community and how it is represented in mainstream media and popular culture.
Aims:

- a critical engagement with the political and ethical dimensions of the media on the one hand and intelligence services on the other
- an appreciation of the institutional developments of open source intelligence gathering and its role in the intelligence cycle
- a framework for understanding and analysing the impact of information operations on the media in times of war
- a critical appreciation of the relationship between government, the intelligence community and the media
- an awareness of how open source intelligence provided by the media affects intelligence reports and political decisions
- a systematic investigation of the challenges media and intelligence professionals face because of the emergence of New Media
- critical analysis, independent judgement, oral and written presentation at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
Learning Outcomes:

- an in-depth knowledge of the role of media as a source of intelligence on two historical cases: World War II and the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan
- a critical engagement in the methodological questions associated with the study of intelligence and the media
- a reflexive understanding of the dynamics of the relationship between journalists and the intelligence services in liberal democracies
- an ability to analyse critically issues arising from intelligence services' attempt to use the media in information campaigns
- a critical awareness of the new challenges for journalists and intelligence analysts with the rise of internet and new social media networks
- an ability to engage critically with the literature on the subject and to undertake independent research

  The aim of this  module is to analyse the role played by the media in the evolution of national and international wars and thus also to better understand the nature of contemporary war. We will try to discover if the media have an impact on decision-making in military interventions or if, rather, they are merely tools in the hands of government officials who want to shape public opinion. This issue is related to several different media phenomena which shall be investigated: the CNN Effect, Agenda Setting, Real Time Policy, Media Diplomacy, Media War, News Management, and Propaganda. The power relations between the media and political and military decision-makers will be therefore explored, as well as the relations between the Media and Civil Society. We will focus on a specific medium, television, and cover all the most relevant conflicts from the Vietnam War up to the recent intervention in Iraq (2003), including also the Falklands, Panama, Iraq (1991), Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and the Sudan. Several different topics will be explained to understand the intersection between war and media: the proliferation of satellite technologies and the Internet; the importance of 24-hours all-news international TV networks (like CNN and al Jazeera); the role of still and moving images; the importance of journalists and journalistic routines; the relevance of press conferences, briefings, and official statements; the emergence of "non-western" media; and also the spread of ethnic conflicts and terrorism, and the more and more asymmetric nature of war.
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
- Providing the student with an overview of the key academic debates about the role of the media in international politics;
- Giving the student all necessary tools to apply the existing theories about media effects in war and conflict to current events;
- Linking the debate about media and war with some key academic works (and other modules given in the department) about the changing nature of contemporary warfare;
- Giving the student some basic skills of textual interpretation and analysis.

Learning outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to acquire a specific knowledge related to media effects in war and conflict:
- An understanding of the political role of the media in the international arena;
- An understanding of international conflicts' dynamics and of the nature of contemporary warfare; 
- An understanding of the present international media market;
- An understanding of the strategies directed to the media by different political actors;
- An understanding of how media effects change in different historical and political contexts.

  Trench warfare is one of the most distinct, prolonged and damaging combat experiences in the history of warfare. As such the western front in the first world war will forever be remembered as the epitome of futile military slaughter, with its killing on an industrial scale, its stalemated tactics and strategy, and its deep psychological effect on the surviving combatants. All too often however, the 'trench experience' is dismissed without being understood: this course explores the reality of trench life and combat; the reasons why men continued to fight in such circumstances, and the psychological and medical responses to the strain of prolonged trench warfare, so called 'shell shock'. It takes as its source material contemporary letters, diaries and memoirs of combat, post-war literature and history, and scholarly academic assessments of the nature of combat in the first world war.
  
  
Aims:
To introduce students to the nature, impact and understanding of combat in the first world war, particularly on the western front
To explain the relationship between combat experience, military morale and psychological trauma in the first world war
To investigate medical responses to the new phenomenon of 'shell shock' 
To promote reflexive engagement with the variety of contemporary and secondary sources for studying combat experience in the first world war
To promote critical analysis of scholarly writings on the experience and impact of combat in the first world warto develop students' ability to engage in critical analysis, independent judgement and oral and written presentation at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
  
  
Objectives:
A student who successfully completes this module will:
Understand the nature and impact of combat on the western front in the first world warBe able to critically evaluate the factors which affected military morale, discipline and soldier's psychological health in trench warfare
Be able to reflect critically on scholarly analysis of the nature, impact and memory of first world war combat, using contemporary and post-war accounts of the experience of combat

  Aims
The aim of the module is to discuss all the ramifications of natural resource conflicts in developing societies and to situate these within the nexus of security and development. The  module is conceived against the increasing importance of natural resources in developing societies and the implications of the attendant conflicts to global peace. The module defines natural resources as all non-artificial products situated on or beneath the soil or rivers, which can be extracted, harvested or used and whose extraction, harvest or usage generate income or serve other functional purposes in benefiting mankind. The conflicts covered under the course include those between and within nations. Among others, the module focuses on the causes and nature of resource conflicts, their connection with local and global governance, the clash between local claims and national interest in resource politics, the link between international demand and pressures on local communities, the activities of warlords, the involvement of the international community in addressing these conflicts and the impact of globalisation on resource conflicts. The module also discusses all the contending debates on natural-resource conflicts and takes examples from across the world to illuminate the different manifestations and complexities of these conflicts. 
  
Learning outcomes:
At the end of the module, it is expected that students will be in a position to understand:
the academic issues surrounding natural resource conflicts, especially the local and international issues that determine their causes and manifestations;
the policy issues raised by these conflicts, especially the efforts by the international community like the Kimberley Process;
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and a host of others; andhow natural resource conflicts have stunted development and affected security in developing societies
  
  
Outline:
(a) Contextualising "Natural resources" and "Conflict"
(b) The conflicts over land
(c) Mineral Resources and Conflict
(d) Water, Water resources and Conflict

  This module examines the interface between the writing of naval history and development of naval education and national strategy in the period between the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War and the twenty-first century. 
Aims:
The aims of the module are to examine the key issues in the development of naval history and strategy, both as case studies in history, and as historiographical and methodological exercises. It works alongside the MA War Studies and History of Warfare Core Programme, especially the History and Strategy components. The methods of historical enquiry that are set out in those elements will be the starting point for the work of this module. The case studies have been selected with reference to the current state of knowledge in the fields covered, and do not form a continuous narrative.
Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:
Understand the way in which the writing of history reflects the environment in which it is written, the objects of the historian and the importance of academic or service links in naval history.
Display a critical understanding of the use of evidence, argument and narrative in history
Assess the development of national naval strategies, both at a national, and a comparative level.
Demonstrate a critical approach to historiographical issues, enabling them to analyse both historical issues, and the work of the historians who have written about them.

  Propaganda has been regarded as one of the key instruments of political practice since the beginning of the 20th century. Propaganda research played a crucial role in establishing the academic field of communication studies in the social sciences. After its heyday in the interwar and early post-cold war years, propaganda research has recently regained the attention of scholar investigating the nexus between information and warfare. This course traces the development of propaganda research over the last century up to the present day. The aim is to discover continuities and ruptures in order to conceptualise information strategies against the background of current conflicts and security issues.

  Rapid developments in communication technology have had a major impact on the relationship between information, security, war and terrorism. This course analyses war reporting by looking at the influence of political leadership, organisational factors in media structures, and the roles and norms of journalists. The course explores in depth the relationship between the military and the media, and how this relationship has been affected by recent technological changes and political developments. Special attention is given to journalistic representations of violence and the emergence of New Media in the reporting of war and terror. The first half of the course explores concepts and theories that help analyse war reporting. In the second term, these concepts are applied to specific cases, the Gulf War, the Afghanistan War, the Iraq War as well as terrorist attacks.

  This module considers the conceptual difficulties involved with the term &lsquo;imperialism&rsquo; in understanding current and past global conflict. Taking an historical perspective on the evolution of western European empires, it challenges many current definitions. Though the British Empire necessarily looms large, the module takes a comparative approach to western empires since the fifteenth century, examining the changing motivation, method, and perceived purpose of expansion. In this way, it will assess, in particular, the role of coercion and of military asymmetry in global history to the present day.
  
    The Occupied Territories Since 1967 - Optional

  Israel's presence in the "occupied territories" has now persisted for over forty years, during which time the number of Jewish settlers in these lands has grown dramatically and Israeli control over the territories has been strengthened by the use of checkpoints, bypass roads, military operations and, most recently, the construction of a "security fence". Palestinians perceive themselves to be a society under occupation. There are different views about the causes of this occupation, and even about whether "occupation" is an appropriate word to describe the situation in these areas. This module looks at the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from 1967 to present as a case of Military Occupation.
It analyses the methods used by Israelis and Palestinians in their struggle to control these disputed lands.
Learning outcomes:
Having successfully completed the module, students will have gained an ability to demonstrate:
An understanding of the term "military occupation".A familiarity with a variety of sources on military occupation.
A comprehensive understanding of the main turning points, themes and issues related to the Israeli occupation from 1967 to present.
An understanding of the ways the Military Government and the Civil Administration function.
An understanding of how the building of Jewish settlements affects the Palestinians and the resources, particularly, water and land.

  
    The Result In War Is Never Final - Optional

  In a little studied, though important, passage in On War, Carl von Clausewitz declared that 'in war the result is never final'. What did he mean by this? Clausewitz, it seems, was suggesting that although our common conception of war is one characterised by the clash of organised armed force, the origin of war itself is more complex. Although war may resolve major clashes of interest, does it denote the cessation of all resistance? What, when it boils down, actually is resistance as a concept? It is these ambiguous and interesting questions that this course will explore. In particular, this module focuses on how people come into conflict with ruling systems and why they choose to live in opposition to political conditions where dissent is punished and the personal costs of disputing the status quo are high? Why do they take stands against systems of rule or orthodoxy that can result in exclusion, lack of preferment, persecution or even extreme personal danger? Through academic literature, memoirs, novels and film, this module will examine the nature of dissidence and resistance with the aim of asking the fundamental question: where does the concept of war truly begin, on the battlefield, or in the mind?
Aims:
The module aims to cover the following issues and questions:
1) What does it mean to resist? Where can we situate mental resistance in the spectrum of war?
2) The nature of dissidence: who becomes a dissident and why?
3) In what political and social contexts does dissidence occur?
4) What are the personal, moral costs and dilemmas associated with dissidence?
5) What is the consequence of a study of dissidence for the understandings of war?

Learning outcomes:
On completion of this module students will have attained a knowledge and understanding of the following:
1) The complexity of the origins and the nature of war and the extent to which it can be said to originate in acts of mental resistance.
2) The nature of systems that cause resistance and dissidence.
3) The moral, ethical and political problems that dissidence and resistance can cause.
4) Why, and at what costs, does one become a dissident?
5) The role of moral conscience in politics

  An April 2010 poll showed that 88% of the UK defence and security community supported the statement that 'the UK needs a radical reassessment of the position it wants, and is able to play, in the world.' (www.rusi.org)
Yet there is no consensus about what the results of such a reassessment should be. Some of the key contours of foreign policy debate &ndash; competing demands from global, European and Atlantic commitments, the role of values and responsibility in foreign policy, the consequences of relative decline &ndash; are remarkably similar to those discussed in the 1960's. But both the world and the UK have changed dramatically in the last half century. The threat of major international war, so dominant in foreign policy during most of the 20th century, has diminished sharply, to be replaced by a wide range of transnational threats and challenges. The role of sub-state domestic actors &ndash; diasporas, businesses, NGOs &ndash; has grown in importance, as has the role of European and international cooperation. The dividing line between domestic and foreign policy has become increasingly blurred, and constitutional change may further limit the powers of the central executive. Across a wide range of issues &ndash; military intervention, aid, human rights, climate change &ndash; there is no national consensus on what the UK's role should be. As in the 1960's, the depth of the UK's fiscal crisis means that it will not be able to escape the 'radical reassessment' that experts agree is needed.
The purpose of this module is to help students to develop a more sophisticated understanding of these issues, and in particular the context, relationships and actors that shape UK foreign policy. It will be of interest to those with a specific interest in UK politics and policy, and also to others interested in foreign policy analysis more generally.
The Module Convenor, Professor Malcolm Chalmers, is Visiting Professor of Defence and Foreign Policy in the Department. He is also Professorial Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and previously worked in the FCO as Special Adviser to the Foreign Secretary. Further details are available on http://www.rusi.org/about/staff/
  
Aims:
The module aims are:
to provide an understanding of the key trends in UK foreign policy since World War Two, and the main forces that have shaped them;
to introduce students to key debates on the UK's role in the world;
to develop a more sophisticated appreciation of the interaction between historical legacy, economic and strategic interests, and domestic politics in the formation of the foreign policy of a middle-sized power.

Learning outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this module, students will have:
developed an increased understanding of the main continuities, and discontinuities, of UK foreign policy in the modern era;
attained an increased ability to critically analyse, and contribute to, debates on foreign policy;
demonstrated an ability to reflect critically on a range of primary and secondary literature;
reflected upon, and improved, their research and learning styles.

  From the end of the Second World and throughout the era that came to be known as the Cold War, the Middle East was a battleground for Great Power rivalries and constant wars and insurgencies. These were fought between Israelis and Arabs, Arabs and Iranians, Arabs and Arabs, local actors and foreign invaders. This module will analyse these wars and insurgencies by focusing, in particular, on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Gulf Wars and Insurgencies in the Occupied Territories, Lebanon and Iraq. The role of the superpowers &ndash; the US and the USSR &ndash; will also be examined.
Aims:

The aims of the module are to:
- provide students with the necessary concepts and tools to analyse the causes and lessons of conflicts in the Middle East, particularly between Israelis and Arabs and in the Gulf region.
- provide students with tools to analyse insurgency in the Middle East, particularly in the occupied territories, Lebanon and Iraq.
- introduce students to specific topics such as oil, water, demography, arms proliferation and more and assess its impact on conflict in the Middle East.
- introduce students to the main sources of information on war and insurgency in the Middle East.
- provide students with tools and background to enable them to critically engage with debates on war and insurgency in the Middle East.

Learning Outcomes:

A successful student will be able to:
- apply his / her understanding of the causes, conduct and lessons of war to the Middle Eastern region and analyse such case studies as the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iran-Iraq war and more.
- analyse the motives and methods of insurgency groups operating in the Middle East.
- explain how water, demography, arms proliferation and more affect conflict in the region.
- engage critically with the literature on the subject, to undertake independent research and to communicate effectively about war and insurgency issues in the Middle East to a level commensurate with MA-level study.

  This half-module offers students the chance to study the important conceptual, historical and contemporary themes within the ambit of intelligence and its relationship to the practice of warfare in the twentieth century. A particular emphasis of this module will be to illustrate the way that issues in intelligence permeate, or shade-off into, particular types of warfare and military operations characterised by covert activities, which sometimes form a specifically identifiable component within individual conflicts that can be classified as wars within wars. This module will explore how certain wars remain in the shadows and how they might be characterised as dirty wars and secret wars. The module will approach these themes utilising a strategic approach to comprehend the uses and objectives of these shadow wars and emphasise an ethical appreciation of the peculiar moral dilemmas that this particular type of war phenomenon induces.
Aims:
  
Learning Outcomes:
On completion of the module students will demonstrate:
A comprehension of the conceptual issues associated with how to define and understand intelligence related phenomena and their impact on warfare.
An appreciation of how to identify the characteristics and dynamics of conflicts that may be termed dirty war and secret war.
Through select case studies attain the ability to dissect and analyse forms of conflict that may be termed wars within wars.
An understanding of the kinds of problems and moral dilemmas generated by these forms of warfare.
