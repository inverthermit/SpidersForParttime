  The Latin American Boom provides one of the great success stories of modern translation. Yet much of the fiction that was translated into English during this period now lies forgotten. What factors govern the commercial success or intellectual influence of translation? What aspects of modern Latin American fiction have been carried into English and what left behind? Boom and Bust seeks answers to these questions through a survey of key Latin American texts and their English translations. The module addresses the following issues: the linguistic and theoretical transfer of categories such as magical realism and the baroque; the roles of individual translators, publishing houses and funders in the production of translation; and the critical reception of the translated texts in journalistic and academic contexts. Students will have the opportunity to explore theoretical debates on stylistics, the cultural turn and more recent sociological approaches to the study of translation.

  Brazilian Populism, Culture and the State explores the relationship between cultural and artistic expression and the state as it developed during the 1930-45 regime of Get&uacute;lio Vargas. It therefore addresses a crucial, formative moment in Brazil&rsquo;s modern cultural history, when most of today&rsquo;s key assumptions about the relationship between popular culture, race and nation were forged.
The module begins by examining the incorporation of popular culture into the Estado Novo&rsquo;s nationalist project, focusing particularly on the cases of samba and carnival. It then explores the revisionist approaches to racial thinking, in particular to the post-Abolition role of Afro-Brazilians and their cultures within the nation, as associated with Gilberto Freyre, and their relationship to emergent forms of autonomous black self-organisation. Alternative and conflicting representations of Afro-Brazilian identity and experience in the 1930s and 40s are examined through a variety of popular song recordings. Finally, the responses of literary writers to the populist project, in particular to the questions of class identity and struggle, the ideology of work, and the relationship between socially and politically committed art and dictatorship, are explored in the work of Jorge Amado, Patricia Galv&atilde;o, Graciliano Ramos and Carlos Drummond de Andrade.

  This module will explore literary responses (in English translation) by Italian and Spanish writers to conflict and division in their respective societies, from the early 20th Century to the present. Common to the history of both is the experience and legacy of dictatorship and a community driven by highly polarized political ideologies and discourses. Although the markedly different trajectories of Italian Fascism and Francoism mean that over the course of the 20th Century writers in Italy and Spain come to engage with divergent political and social realities, social crisis, division and dysfunction continue to provide points of connection. This module will set the respective accounts of Italian and Spanish writers in their historical context and examine and compare their various approaches to the circumstances and events which their works depict. It will consider literary representation, device and effect, along with the ideological framework informing perspectives, encountering in the process a range of subjects and themes arising from these writers&rsquo; engagement with the political and social realities of their time; subjects and themes such as totalitarianism, civil conflict, organized crime, rural and urban deprivation, censorship, exile, social anomie and alienation, social responsibility and complicity, collective amnesia, political disillusionment, historical recuperation. In this way, the module aims to offer students an insight into the ways culture responds to conflict and division, as well as an understanding of two historically conflictual and divided societies via the unique, and often intimate, perspective which literature provides.

  This module provides a historical survey of the horror and gothic genres in Spanish cinema since Francoism. It will consider the ways in which horror and gothic conventions and archetypes have been used by filmmakers in order to articulate preoccupations with politics, gender, the family, the body, modernity and art itself. It will consider how Spanish cinema has engaged and continues to engage via the horror and the gothic with the social, political and cultural realities, whether in the context of Francoism, the transition to democracy or present-day Spain.

Among the material to be studied are the production of female and male artists such as the Mexican Jos&eacute; Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913), the Argentinian Oliverio Girondo (1891-1967), the Chilean Nicanor Parra (1914), the Peruvian Jorge Eduardo Eielson (1924-2006), the Cuban Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) and the Colombian Doris Salcedo (1958).

  This MA module is conceived as both as an independent module and as a companion module to 7AASM025 (not running 2014-15) through its focus on one of the fundamental periods of innovation and change in Latin American narrative: the Regional Novel of the Early 20th Century. The module is designed to identify the main features of the cultural and social context as well as examining four key texts which exemplify transformations in narrative forms that are associated with the period. The end of the Nineteenth century signalled relative political stability and economic expansion for most of Latin America. Writers engaged with these changes in two principal ways: by drawing on international influences and by examining local cultures. We will study the complex dynamics of inclusion and exclusion that structure the resulting representations of nationalism and cultural belonging. We will examine how telluric novels describe local realities through nature, rural life and cultural traits peculiar to particular areas. We will simultaneously ask how &ndash; despite some very traditional representational strategies - they can be understood to play a crucial role in defining Latin American cultural modernity. We will open this enquiry to a more general reconsideration of the representational strategies of these novels and examine how tensions between the representation of a national project envisaging eventual homogenisation is balanced with representations of the nation as consisting of very different sets of relations between emerging social subjects.

  Founded in the eighth century by exiles from Damascus and Baghdad, Muslim Spain has always been a frontier society, and its well-known status as a cultural crossroads lends itself perfectly to a historicised and comparatist study some of the central concerns of postcolonial theory (e.g. the work of Said and Babha). Using a comparatist and historicised approach to postcolonial theory the course examines how the representation of a particular place&mdash;Andalusia in general, but principally Granada and the Alhambra palace&mdash;is used to explore a range of cultural and political problems, whose formulation and significance shift over the centuries. These problems include: the emergence of the idea of 'Europe' itself, and the shifting categories of 'East' and 'West'; cultural hybridity and identity formation (structured by the complex interactions between class, gender and ethnicity); the conflict between political freedom and subjection to absolute, centralised authority.

  The story and meaning of the twentieth century is shaped by the historical experiences, and hegemonic interpretations of those experiences, of a very few European/Western countries. When, where and what was the Portuguese twentieth century? This course aims to provide post-nationalist and postcolonial approaches to the political, social, economic and cultural history of the peoples of Portugal and its dependent territories in the period 1910-1998. Although informed by a grand narrative of nation building and politicisation, and organised in terms of the periodisation of three political regimes (I Republic; New State; Democratic Portugal), the foci chosen for each session are deliberately transruptive of lazy contextual wholes and unilinear progressive narratives.

  The module examines samples from an important body of writing by men from the late fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth centuries that are concerned with the nature of woman. Many of the notions that appear in such texts are by no means only relevant to the Middle Ages, but are still in circulation; in this way they cast much light on current underlying attitudes to women.
