  The explosion of international business activities has had a marked impact on our lifestyles, income and on the economic environment in general. Companies are forced to seek international trade and investment opportunities in distant markets. Doing business overseas is, however, still considered to be a difficult task. Often we hear stories about unsuccessful encounters between business executives from different cultures mainly because they are not able to communicate and negotiate effectively with each other. Treating negotiations as a technique that can be learned and adapted to international business relations, this module deals with four main inter-related themes: conflict resolution, business negotiations skills, the cross-cultural communication and management of cultural differences in international business deals, and ethical issues in doing business abroad.

Against this background, the module then turns to key marketing concepts such as the &lsquo;market&rsquo;, &lsquo;exchange&rsquo; and &lsquo;value&rsquo; to reveal how technology is used to constitute markets, facilitate exchange and generate value. The module ends with an exploration of consumer behaviour and recent changes in technology that have impacted the relationship between production and consumption as well as the ways in which market and marketing researchers study consumer behaviour.
