At the start of the semester you will have the opportunity to attend taster lectures and to speak to module leaders before you make a decision on whether to undertake a specialist or tailored LLM.
For all options, you will need to study full or half-modules that add up to a total of 180 credits. A list of all modules is shown below. Each module is worth 40 credits (with half modules worth 20 credits). You will need to select modules of your choice that add up to 120 credits in total.
To achieve the additional 60 credits you need to choose between guided LLM research options, which include a longer dissertation or shorter research essay requirement.

  The  module concerns the impact of information technologies on the private lives of individuals. The digitisation of information has brought about a multitude of data harvesting and processing technologies that now operate on a global scale. Information processing has become essential not just to finance and commerce, but also to advances in public health, education, crime prevention and economic growth.
In this module,  you will study the legal concepts and rules that are used to determine the limits of personal autonomy and consent in the new world of 'big data'. It will focus on rights to privacy and confidentiality as well as countervailing rights and interests in freedom of speech, public order and security and collective well being.  We will  also examine laws that enable individual access to personal information, such as freedom of information law, and other means of controlling personal information. The module will focus on European legal standards, including their implementation in member states and states outside the European Union, as well as comparison with alternative legal models and concepts, such as those prevailing in the United States and China.

  Module description
This module analyses the law and policy in respect of registered trademarks. There is a consideration of the registration system for trademarks both in the United Kingdomand the European Community. In this context, the module covers central issues such as the subject matter which can be registered, absolute and relative grounds for refusal of registration, revocation, infringement and defences. Additionally, the module considers legal regimes for the protection of unregistered marks, in particular, the action for passing off (with its constituent elements of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage).
An assessment will be made of the effectiveness of the law of trademarks, both from the point of view of the business and general community, as well as the rights of the proprietor of the trademark in terms of the exploitation and use of the mark.
