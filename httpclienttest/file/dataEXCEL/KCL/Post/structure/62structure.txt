STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   The programme provides opportunities for multidisciplinary postgraduate students to develop and demonstrate knowledge and understanding and skills in the following areas:
Typical brain development - students will be given a basic understanding of 'neurotypical' brain development. This is essential in order to understand the biological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Students will also be introduced to the different types of in vivo
 brain imaging methods and basic genetics to enable them to understand recent advances made in this area.
Neurodevelopmental disorders  - students will learn about neurodevelopmental disorders as defined by DSM-5. The focus will be on (a) Intellectual Developmental Disorders, (b) Autism Spectrum Disorder and (c) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The clinical emphasis will be on the adult population.
Forensic aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders - the programme will explore issues relevant to people with neurodevelopmental disorders who come into contact with the criminal justice system (CJS). This will lead to a greater understanding of how this group is at increased risk of being both victims and perpetrators of specific criminal offences and how the CJS is adapted to manage their specific needs.
Clinical placement - the aim of the clinical placement is to contextualise and consolidate the knowledge obtained through lectures and tutorials. Students will also learn to present individual cases in a succinct manner by preparing a case report.
Research methods   statistics - students will be equipped with essential skills and knowledge to critically appraise evidence and undertake their own research.
