  &bull; This module examines the social organisation of psychiatry as an apparatus for defining and regulating &lsquo;madness&rsquo; - and sanity.
&bull; We consider contemporary western psychiatric conceptions of mental illness and their critics, and use historical investigations to explore the complex links between psychiatric theories and practices and the emergence of &lsquo;modern&rsquo; societies.
&bull; We consider the birth of the asylum system in the nineteenth century and its relation to the development of modern, urban and industrial forms of life and cultural norms of conduct.
&bull; We explore &lsquo;colonial&rsquo; psychiatry, and its role in the management of conduct in the colonies. We examine the transformation of the psychiatric system in the first half of the twentieth century, with the discovery of &lsquo;the neuroses&rsquo; and a &lsquo;psychiatrisation of everyday life&rsquo;.
&bull; We analyse further major changes in psychiatry over the last twenty five years: the moves towards &lsquo;community psychiatry&rsquo; and the management of risk; the rise of biological explanations and treatments of mental disorder; the transnational spread of psychiatric medications such as tranquillisers and antidepressants.
&bull; We explore the globalization of psychiatry, considering both the rise of &lsquo;transcultural&rsquo; psychiatry, and the recent scholarship on the spread of &lsquo;western&rsquo; categories and practices to other societies and cultures.
&bull; Throughout the module, our focus will be on the relations of knowledge, power and expertise in psychiatry in different cultures, upon the ways in which psychiatry has operated as a means of social regulation, and upon the role of psychiatry in the cultural construction of normality and abnormality.

  This module enables students to understand social science perspectives on the contemporary bioeconomy. Spanning both industrialised nations and the emerging economies of Asia Pacific, it will explore how the biomedical research enterprise is being reshaped by governments and corporations as they search for competitive advantage in an increasingly global bioeconomy.
The module is interdisciplinary drawing inter alia on science and technology studies, socio-legal studies and political economy. Topics covered will include: the emergence of the idea of a knowledge-based economy, and its function as part of the neoliberal state project (the shift from government to governance); the concept of promissory science and the promotion of biotechnology as a &lsquo;frontier technology&rsquo;; the formation of public policy through processes of multi-level governance at the local, national and transnational levels; the intersection between public policy and commercial strategy, and the changing relationships between governments, corporations and academic scientists; the globalisation of academic research and corporate R D; the role of regulation as a both a response to and a shaper of biotechnologies; the importance of intellectual property rights in the bioeconomy, the legalisation of patents on novel life-based technologies and the globalisation of the IP regime favoured by Western pharmaceutical companies through the TRIPS agreement; and the public health consequences of focusing biomedical R D on emergent biotechnologies

  We seem to live in a world of disasters and emergencies, with one crisis piling on another. In this module we explore the contemporary politics of disasters and emergencies and we examine how critical events garner attention and galvanize social and political action. Rather than take disasters and emergencies as presumably self-evident events for granted, we explore disasters and emergencies as a social imaginary, and that is to say, as a particular way of perceiving the world. This perception is now at the heart of an expanding industry of emergency management and disaster relief. In this module we analyze this global industry, using anthropological, sociological, and historical approaches. How have disasters and emergencies contributed to the rethinking and reshaping of what political action means today? How has the temporality of emergency affected the perception of social and political problems?
Aims
&#61607; To describe the key actors and institutions as well as discourses and practices that seek to address contemporary health crises.
&#61607; To introduce students to the key concepts and debates in anthropological, sociological, and historical studies of disasters and emergencies.
&#61607; To give students the abilities to analyze emergency relief and disaster prevention from a critical point of view.
&#61607; To provide students with an understanding of the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic factors that shape the perception of disasters and emergencies.
&#61607; To provide students with the skills to critically evaluate humanitarian interventions and to identify the role of key stakeholders in shaping them.

  Below are the indicative topics that can be taken. Any two of the topics listed below can be selected for Topics in Medical Ethics I (20 credits); any two topics not already selected can be taken for Topics in Medical Ethics II (20 credits). These modules provide you with a knowledge and critical understanding of key topics in medical ethics.
Psychriatic Ethics
Psychiatric practitioners and other mental health professionals face a set of distinctive ethical questions that link into deep philosophical issues to do with the mind. This topic addresses a range of central issues in this area: how to define mental disorder, and corresponding issues concerning diagnosis and the relevance of neuroscience; ethical dilemmas concerning autonomy and mental disorder, particularly in relation to substituted decisions and advance directives; and the question of why mental disorder is taken to be relevant to moral and criminal responsibility.
Justice    the Allocation of Health Care Resources
In a situation of permanent scarcity of health care resources but with a National Health Service, many difficult moral problems arise about how the resources we have should be used. This module addresses these issues by examining what social justice requires and whether considerations of justice can give us a practical resolution of the problem of scarce resources. It looks at some of the decisions made by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and at the cost-benefit analysis behind its decision-making.  You will also consider some of the problems associated with other countries' approach to these issues.
Reproductive Ethics
This module covers the central issues in reproductive ethics by addressing a number of key topics such as abortion, and disability and in so doing it familiarises  you with the key ethical arguments in this context. The main theme concerns the scope of the moral interest in having or not having a child or children.
Reproduction    Genetics
This module covers the central ethical issues in genetic selection practices by addressing key topics in relation to selection by means of pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD), prenatal diagnosis (PND) and selective abortion and by identifying and clarifying the key ethical arguments in this context.
Autism
Autism, once thought to be a rare condition, is now estimated to affect 1 in every 100 people (some estimates are 1 in 68). As a complex neurodevelopmental condition autism manifests itself very differently from one person to another, ranging from very high functioning to very low functioning abilities and all the points in between. This course will consider what we actually know about autism spectrum conditions and how best we should understand them. The ethical questions are correspondingly complex. The topic will address some of these, including the crucial question of whether autism is best understood as a disability in all cases or should be understood as an acceptable cognitive difference. Other key issues include the surprising association between autism and talent and how this might affect our thinking about disability, reproductive decision-making and the search for a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for autism.
Neuroethics
Recent advances in the brain sciences offer new ways of learning about ourselves and others, using powerful technologies. These developments raise a range of ethical questions, some that are versions of familiar questions in bioethics, and others that are completely new. This topic addresses both kinds of question, providing a survey of this emerging field. The issues covered include the ethics of incidental findings in the context of neuroscience research; issues arising in the context of new technologies for detecting minimally conscious states; the use of neuroimaging in the courtroom; and the implications of cognitive science for our understanding of morality and freedom.
Autonomy and Public Health
Public health ethics is concerned with justifications for public health programmes, policies and law. Work in this area addresses population-level questions about the promotion and protection of health. This topic focuses on the core tension between individual autonomy and health. The appropriate limits of state action in promoting or preserving health are considered through the examination of: interventions that &ldquo;nudge&rdquo;; the use of health incentives; supported decision-making and a relational understanding of autonomy; and what should be done in the context of contagious disease.

  This module examines the phenomenon of war related violence, destruction, distress, and trauma-related health problems, health-seeking and healing practices. We will follow and discuss the debates of researchers who have tried to determine and verify the effects of violent conflict on the mental health of those affected by focusing on concepts like war trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social suffering, and idioms of distress. We will problematize conventional and universal understandings of trauma, and disease-centered approaches to traumatic experience and health interventions.
Class sessions will involve lectures, guest lectures, student presentations, discussions, film screenings, and review activities. To involve students in their own learning, make seminar topics come alive, to deepen students&rsquo; knowledge of a topic, and to develop particular skills, questions which stimulate critical thinking, annotated suggestions for further readings, and lists of related websites will be provided.
Aims
&bull; To introduce students to key concepts and debates around war trauma and relevant interventions.
&bull; To approach mental health and wars from an interdisciplinary angle by reviewing the publications of work in the fields of medicine, public health, psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, history and philosophy.
&bull; To develop an understanding of theories of and approaches related to the key concepts related to war, mental health and healing.
&bull; To synthesise, compare, and critically discuss key concepts, academic debates, research approaches and relevant ethnographic studies.
