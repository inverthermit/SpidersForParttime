   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  The programme is offered on a part-time basis in conjunction with compulsory clinical placements. Lectures are delivered in a block format of  three to four  days per month. Coursework, practical assessment and written examinations assess the modules. Clinical competence is assessed by ongoing formative and summative assessments and an observational visit by a member of the Programme Team.

    Credit level:  
7  
    
  
  
      
   
    
  
       
      This is assessed by a case study presentation, a written examination, and OSCE and a clinical assessment.
     
  This modules aims:
to faciltate understanding of normal ultrasound anatomy and physiology, and common pathologies of the abdominal and pelvic organs,  other viscera, small parts and the vascular system
to provide the  skills to  recognise, interpret and report on normal and abnormal ultrasound tissue patterns
to ensure the student works safely with due regard to the patient's psychological and physiological needs.

  
    Negotiated Learning In Medical Ultrasound - Optional

    
  
      
     Module code:  
7MWOUL15    
  
    Credit level:  
7  
    
  
  
      
   
    
  
       
    
     
  This module aims to encourage an independent approach to ultrasound learning; examine health issues in an innovative way and foster a reflective approach to ultrasound learning. Specific learning outcomes will be negotiated with the tutor and will be recorded in a learning contract. On successful completion of this module the student will be able to critically evaluate research and professional literature relevant to the selected topic area; critically reflect on their learning needs; present evidence to support the ultrasound learning undertaken through the module; present evidence to support the personal and professional development achieved; extract, evaluate, synthesise and present information gained from primary and secondary sources (critical thinking) and exercise autonomy in the management of their learning and Continuing Professional Development. Assessment is by coursework and  case presentation.
  
    Negotiated Learning With Clinical Competence In Ultrasound - Optional

    
  
      
     Module code:  
7MWOUL16    
  
    Credit level:  
7  
    
  
  
      
   
    
  
       
    
     
  This module involves the negotiation of specific learning outcomes in ultrasound that are competency based and will be embedded in a personal development plan negotiated between the student, the university tutor and the student&rsquo;s workplace mentor.   Depending on the student's topic they may be required to attend lectures with other student groups (e.g. EP   gynae students would attend relevant sessions within the O G module) Students may be:
clinicians who wish to use a focused area of ultrasound in their practice (e.g. a stroke physician wishing to study carotid ultrasound).  With successful completion of Fundamentals of Ultrasound they would achieve the PG Cert.
obstetricians and midwives who wish to study ultrasound beyond the PG Cert by extending their scanning skills within O G ultrasound
experienced, qualified sonographers extending their proficiency in a specialist area. This will give them the opportunity to study and gain academic credit for their area of extended clinical competence.

  
    Obstetrics   Gynaecology Ultrasound - Optional

    
  
      
     Module code:  
7MWOUL02

  This module aims:
To provide the  student with an understanding of the pathologies and abnormalities relating to obstetric and gynaecological practice
To produce, recognise, interpret and report on normal and abnormal ultrasound image patterns
To discuss and evaluate the choice of ultrasound techniques, equipment and methods of recording the image
To provide the student with the necessary information to produce high quality diagnostic images of a wide range of obstetric and gynaecological conditions;
To enable the student to work safely and responsibly with due regard to the patient's psychological and physiological needs.

  This module will enhance students&rsquo; understanding of research and  equip them with the skills to evaluate the research of others.  Students will be taught how to use and interpret descriptive statistics and how to use statistical tests in relation to a given hypothesis. Students will acquire skills to construct a research proposal, and to carry out independent research or audit confidently
  
    Research Project - Optional

      This is assessed by a written case study, a written examination, an OSCE and a clinical assessment.
     
  The aims of this module are:
To provide the student with an understanding of the use of ultrasound in vascular diagnosis.
To provide the student with an understanding of blood flow and pathology in vascular disorders.
To provide the student with an understanding of other non-invasive and invasive techniques for vascular diagnosis and an understanding of the relative merits and limitations of these techniques.
To produce, recognize, interpret and report on normal and abnormal ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound images for vascular diagnosis.
