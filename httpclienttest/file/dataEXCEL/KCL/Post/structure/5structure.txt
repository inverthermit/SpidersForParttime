STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   The MSc in Addiction Studies consists of seven modules, while the PG Certificate consists of  three modules (1, 2 and 3 below). The following provides a brief summary of the programme structure:

Module 1: Introduction to Addiction Science and Theory (30 Credits)
A compulsory fundamental module which explores the aetiology and nature of addiction problems, the historical development and theoretical perspectives of addiction as a health related problem. This module will also explore the theoretical and evidence-based underpinnings of current pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions for responding to addictive behaviour.
Module 2: Psychopharmacology of Drug Action and Addiction (15 credits)
A compulsory fundamental module which will explore the psychopharmacological and biological mechanisms underpinning drug action and dependence.
Module 3: Research Methods, Critical Appraisal and Statistics (15 credits)
A compulsory fundamental module which is designed to develop research skills relevant to scholarship and evidence-based practice including critical appraisal, basic biostatistics and methodology.
Module 4: Contemporary Advances in Addiction Research, Policy, Prevention   Practice (15 credits)
This module will introduce the concepts of policy development, prevention strategies and incorporate current andrecent research conducted within the Addictions Clinical Academic Group (CAG).
Module 5: Advanced Addiction Practice (15 credits)
This module provides further information on the theories and evidence base that guide clinical practice, and incorporates the clinical placement.
Research Project (60 Credits)
This module encompasses the conduct of a small research project to demonstrate the effective use of evidence within the fields of addiction science, policy and treatment.
     
   Indicative non-core content
   Optional Modules (30 credits) (one from the following):
Advanced Addiction Biology
This optional module is co-offered within the MSc in Neuroscience. It explores advanced biological constructs, such as neurobiology at the molecular and systems level, and genetic and environmental risk factors of addiction.
Advanced Clinical Management of Addiction
This optional module provides advanced knowledge and skills of the primary psychosocial and pharmacotherapeutic techniques that support effective addiction treatment.
     
   
   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  A variety of learning methods are used including lectures, seminars, tutorials, journal clubs, practice supervision groups, clinical placements, field experience and self-directed study. This is augmented with the opportunity to share ideas and views with fellow learners either face-to-face or using a discussion board through the KEATS e-learning platform. Learning is supported by online self-directed learning packages and access to additional lecture material. Assessment is by essays, written examinations, OSCEs, and reflective learning techniques.

  This module 

Explores advanced biological approaches to addiction including neuroimaging and pharmacogenetics
By focusing on current research in the addictions, the module will enhance the student&rsquo;s understanding of research methods and so improve their ability to undertake a successful MSc research project.
Places a strong emphasis on enabling students to critically appraise the relevant scientific literature, to evaluate design of experiments and analysis of data.
The module will be compulsory for those students wishing to specialise in this subject area.The module will introduce students to the wide range of model systems that are used in basic research into drug- and behavioural addictions and the associated experimental protocols.
The aim is to develop students' ability to understand and to interpret scientific literature specific to research in addiction biology.

Students completing this module in combination with Module C2 Research Project in Addiction Biology will be equipped to make an informed career choice, either in further postgraduate education (e.g. PhD) or employment related to the addictions. Alternatively, students may wish to choose a research project in a different subject area leading to an understanding of research activities in two neuroscience fields.
