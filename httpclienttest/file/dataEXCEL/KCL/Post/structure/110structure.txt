The latest research findings will be incorporated in the module including the development of new experimental treatments.

At the end of the present module the students will be able to:
Describe the most up-to-date, evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of early psychosis, and how these differ for the prodromal and first episode phase and for the affective and schizophrenic form of the disorder.
Critically discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the available pharmacological treatments in early psychosis as well as the potential of new experimental interventions.
Describe the most common side effects of psychopharmacological interventions in early psychosis and ways of minimizing their impact on the success of the treatment.
Critically discuss the rationale and principles for developing a customized psychopharmacological treatment plan in early psychosis on the basis of the individual needs of the patients.

  Educational aims 
This module will focus on psychosocial interventions during the early phases of psychosis. Experienced clinical academics will provide international-level conceptual and practical guidelines for the psychosocial management of both the prodromal and first episode phase of the illness. The lectures will cover different types of psychosocial intervention including psychological treatment (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, cognitive remediation, mindfulness therapy, psychosocial education), occupational therapy and family intervention. Students will also learn about the rationale and principles for developing a personalized psychosocial intervention plan on the basis of the individual needs of the patient. The latest research findings will be incorporated in the module including the development of new psychosocial treatments.

  Educational aims
This module will provide students with a solid grounding in research methods relevant to the study of early psychosis, with a strong focus on the rich and varied clinical population studied locally. Specific topics will include literature searches, ethics, data protection, study design, international research and a variety of evaluation tools and methodological approaches, from epidemiology to neuroimaging. The general principles of clinical research will be introduced, focusing on the evaluation of both biological and social factors relevant to the development, course and outcome of early psychosis. Therefore, the module will provide a multidisciplinary perspective spanning through psychology, psychiatry, sociology and neuroscience. There will be particular emphasis on the clinical translation of the different methodological approaches for patient benefit. The lectures will be given by expert scientists and clinicians, most of them working at or in close collaboration with the Institute of Psychiatry.

  Educational aims
 The aim of this module is to train students to undertake research in the area of early intervention in psychosis. It provides them with the opportunity to work, uninterrupted, on a closely-supervised research project for approximately 20 weeks full-time or the equivalent in part-time study. This module should be taken last as part of the MSc in Early Intervention in Psychosis in order to enable students to use the specialist conceptual knowledge acquired from the other modules.
The research project will comprise of different stages including the generation of testable hypotheses; the development of an appropriate experimental design; the acquisition of empirical data, the analysis of the data using appropriate statistical methods; the critical evaluation of the results; the writing up of the project.
In addition to becoming proficient in the specific methods used for the purpose of their project, students will also acquire generic research skills. These include the requirements for ethical approval and research governance; the use of a chronological log which details everything the student has done as part of the project; writing a research report comprising of the introduction, methods, results, discussion and bibliography.

Learning outcomes
 On completion of this module, students will have acquired the theoretical and practical knowledge required to undertake supervised research work, especially within the specific area of early intervention in psychosis which was the focus of their project. In particular students will be able to:
Perform a critical review of the existing literature and use the outcome of this review to generate a timely and testable hypothesis
Acquire and store experimental data in a scientific style and analyze them using the most appropriate analytical methods
Interpret their experimental findings and critically appraise how these have advanced knowledge of the subject
Critically discuss the strengths and limitations of their study and propose directions for future work
