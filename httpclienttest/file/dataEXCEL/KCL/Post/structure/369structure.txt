  This module introduces you to advanced scholarly research and writing practices in the fields of Theatre and Performance Studies, with an emphasis on language, historiography, ethnography, and performance-as-research, as well as performative writing. Questions that shape this module include: how and what do we see when we consider performance events in theatres or city spaces? How do we record, analyse, and disseminate these events? What frames (institutional or discursive) shape our objects of our analysis? What ethics, aesthetics, and politics of space, archives and print cultures determine our access to and understanding of the contours of theatre and performance?

  This module investigates major strands of critical inquiry in theatre and performance studies, introducing students to a range of critical writings, from foundational texts in the discipline to some of the most recent work being done in theatre and performance studies today. At the same time, it considers the interactions of performance theory with other theoretical and disciplinary approaches including speech act theory, feminist and queer theory, anthropology, postcolonial theory, visual art theory, ethics, and others. By the end of the module, students will have a strong foundation in theatre and performance theory and will be acquainted with a range of critical debates concerning the nature of performance as an aesthetic and cultural form, and as a facet of everyday life.

  This module provides a critical introduction to theatre in London for post-graduate students. The course examines the production of current theatre and performance in the city with an emphasis on staged performance backed up by selected critical and creative texts. Alongside these artistic acts students will be introduced to ways in which the city of London itself is a landscape of continuous performances, ceremonies and events with institutions such as the Royal Courts of Justice, the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show and the Freud Museum all worthy of close attention for the way they operate through means of performance.

  This module addresses intersecting histories of performance and live art practices of the past fifty years, including Happenings, Body Art, Performance Art, and Experimental Theatre. In this module, students will consider how various media and art forms - including theatre, painting, sculpture, film, and photography - come together in live art practices. We will engage closely with the formal, political, and theoretical challenges posed by live art, including issues of spectatorship, duration, embodiment, liveness, ephemerality, and documentation, and consider the ways in which different discourses emerging out of the visual arts, theatre, and performance studies variously frame and understand live art practices. By the end of this module, students will have an awareness of the history of live art as it has emerged over the past half century in relation to movements in theatre and the visual arts, including familiarity with a range of key artists and live art works. They will have the skills to interpret and analyse performance and live art works, including being able to place them within a broader historical and theoretical context.

  This module provides students with the opportunity to develop individual and small-group performance projects as investigations into critical concepts in performance studies. Students are exposed to the idea of &lsquo;practice-based research&rsquo; in which theoretical questions are explored through practical exercises, leading to critical reflection and analysis in written form. This will take place through a series of led workshops and unsupervised project time, taking advantage of the Anatomy Theatre   Museum studio space that is allocated to performance studies. The workshops move through a series of key questions, and may be led by a combination of King&rsquo;s staff and guest artists.

  The Special Topics module gives students the opportunity to learn from a member of staff about a specific area of their research. For 2015-16, the topic will be:
Contemporary Dramaturgies
Dramaturgy is a booming artistic and conceptual practice that has taken the contemporary dance, theatre and art worlds by storm in the last decades, after centuries of dramaturgical work by dramatists and drama theorists including Aristotle, Lessing, Schiller and others. But whereas so-called traditional dramaturgy emphasises the meaning, structure and articulation of a dramatic text and action for performance on a (frequently national) theatre stage, contemporary dramaturgies operate in an extended field, to match the proliferation of sites of performance and performative modes of address that have unfurled in the last century. So too, contemporary dramaturgies articulate ways of thinking about the labour of thought, imagined somewhere between the (play) text and the theatrical (or choreographic) event, at times awkwardly producing neither. This module then pays homage to the historical legacy of dramaturgy as a philosophical and practical process of creative articulation in an extended performative field, but extends the notion of dramaturgy further still to include philosophical writing that experiments with dramaturgical thought structures: thought-images (denkbilden), drifts, fragments, aphorisms, difference and repetition. Philosophical dramaturgies in this sense take shape, even while they may elude the mimetic work of dramatic representation.
