STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   The programme is modeled on our advanced practice MSc programme undertaken by our local students. It utilizes the same modules with the same content. The programme has a defined structure and does not include any options. Tailoring of the module content to your clinical specialty is achieved by choosing assessment topics based upon your own clinical specialty. This programme requires that the practitioner is in clinical practice, as one of the module included has a clinical competency assessment.
Currently, students study the following modules shown below. King's reviews its modules on a regular basis, in order to continue to offer innovative and exciting programmes and this list is therefore subject to change. Please check here for updates, or contact the faculty/department for further advice. Students take courses worth 60 credits in each of the three years.
