  Sport has been a critical cultural force in U.S. history, and is arguably as definitive for U.S. identities as film or music. However, its significance has often been overlooked. This course will discuss the development of modern sports in the United States from the mid-19th century on. It will focus on the emergence of sports clubs, the role of national sports heroes, the business of sports, and health reform movements. Sport will be discussed as a force of cultural production and social change. Through the prism of sports this course provides a new understanding of Progressivism, consumerism, and race and gender politics in 20th century U.S. history. It will also provide knowledge of a number of methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding the role of sports, the body, and spectacles in the shaping of modern societies and nations.

  This course will examine the ways in which the Cold War affected the UK&rsquo;s foreign, military and domestic policymaking in the broader European context. It will be the aim of this course to demonstrate that the Cold War was not simply a conflict between the two superpowers, with lesser powers like the UK simply acting as their agents, but that in UK&rsquo;s case the response was based upon the long history of Anglo-Russian and subsequently Anglo-Soviet relations; on the challenges that Britain faced as European power with a declining global Imperial presence; on her position in Europe after the World War II; on her military strength (or weakness); and her determination to remain on the &lsquo;top table&rsquo; of world affairs.
Topics covered will include: Anglo-Russian and Anglo-Soviet Relations in the European context until 1945; Britain and the origins of the Cold War in Europe; the development of the UK&rsquo;s nuclear deterrent; Britain and Western European Security (including the Helsinki Accords); the UK&rsquo;s response to the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI or Star Wars); the Falklands War; and the Fall of the Berlin Wall.

  The colonies of settlement have been neglected in studies of British imperialism in recent decades. This module will focus attention on the shared histories of Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa since the early-nineteenth century as part of a larger &lsquo;British World&rsquo;. These societies&rsquo; evolution from colonies to self-governing dominions and independent nations, as well as their common dispossession and marginalisation of Indigenous peoples, will be examined not only comparatively but also by exploring the sense of belonging that developed among them, based on shared origins, culture, experience and identity. The module will examine factors such as those which brought these various communities together &ndash; cultural, political, economic, constitutional and military &ndash; as well as the forces that eventually drove them apart from one another, and from Great Britain itself.

  Over the last two hundred years, Europe has become a much smaller place. Railways, newspapers, telegraphs, radios and many other forms of communication have swallowed up territory. Even the most determinedly backward inhabitants of Europe have often found it difficult to remain ignorant of events and issues of national or international significance. There are two broad ways of interpreting these developments. One is to see them as evidence of progress and modernization; as a way of spreading education and enlightenment, of involving more people in the business of democracy, of offering citizens new, and generally benign, social and cultural allegiances; as a means of turning peasants into Frenchmen, and Frenchmen and Germans into Europeans. Another is to see the increased scope of communications as a potential danger: as a force that can atomize citizens, enforce conformity, or (more subtly) hold out the illusion of membership in a political community while at the same time effectively disabling democracy. This more pessimistic view tends to be associated with theories of mass society, and especially with accounts of totalitarian regimes. As these examples might begin to suggest, the production, dissemination and reception of information and knowledge is sometimes granted quite a lot of explanatory power in the historiography of modern Europe. But questions of communication are usually mentioned in passing, as one of several factors in the rise of the nation-state, the establishment of bourgeois hegemony, the maintenance of fascist dictatorship, or whatever else suits the historian&rsquo;s design. 
 This module offers the opportunity to reflect at greater length on the effects of the key media of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe: books, journals, newspapers, pamphlets, photography, cinema, radio, television, and so on. Topics for consideration will include: the emergence of &lsquo;public opinion&rsquo; and the creation of a &lsquo;public sphere&rsquo;; the social and political effects of literacy; the making of revolutions and nations; state propaganda; censorship; media, modernity and post-modernity.

  he three keywords in the module title together evoke a particular historical conjuncture. We will look at two empires &ndash; the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian &ndash; as they contended with the rise of national sentiment at a time of rapid social, economic and cultural change (otherwise known as modernity). There will be a strong emphasis on comparative analysis, both as a way of capturing the historical specificity of these empires and as a means of reflecting more broadly on the nature of empire &ndash; a normal, not aberrant form of political organization for nineteenth-century Europe &ndash; at a historical moment when it was under interrogation as never before.

  In this module (which is designed to follow on from &lsquo;Empire, Nation and Modernity in Eastern Europe, 1848-1914', but can also be free-standing) we will examine two empires &ndash; the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian &ndash; as they faced the crisis of World War I and fell apart. We then go on to consider their successor states &ndash; above all the USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary &ndash; with particular reference to the ways in which they contended with national sentiment and ethnic difference at a time of rapid social, economic and cultural change. There will be a strong emphasis on comparative analysis, both as a way of capturing the historical specificity of these regions and as a means of reflecting more broadly on the interwar and postwar conjunctures.

  This module aims to answer the question: what has been the role of what are called &lsquo;science&rsquo; and &lsquo;technology&rsquo; in twentieth-century British history? How does consideration of the history of science and technology affect our understanding of the British elite, the empire, industrial development, ideology and politics. The module reflects the historiography of the last twenty years which has radically changed our understating of the nature of modern Britain not least by demonstrating the significance of science and technology to the power of its state, its business and its empire. The module introduces students to some of key concepts for the study of twentieth-century Britain, such as decline and the welfare state from a fresh perspective, and students will get an insight into the development of the historiography of twentieth century Britain.

  This module will offer an overview of French imperial ventures in the modern era, from France&rsquo;s American empire in the early modern period to the Napoleonic empires of the nineteenth century and its African and Indochinese empire after 1870. Recent years have seen a reappraisal of both the French contribution to the development of European imperialism and the impact of imperial expansion on France and continental Europe. Comparisons between the French and other European empires, especially Britain&rsquo;s, have played a significant part in the surge of interest in world and imperial history. The large time span covered by the module will encourage students to analyse the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of empire throughout the modern era. A simultaneously comparative and connective approach will familiarize students with several core concepts of world history, including the striking of the balance between change and continuity in long historical narratives and the complex relations between centres and their peripheries. Special attention will be paid to colonial revolutions in a French imperial context such as in Haiti in the eighteenth century, Germany under Napoleon, and Algeria in the twentieth century. Knowledge of French is not required.

  In the light of today&rsquo;s wide-ranging concerns with the health and provenance of food, it is timely to look back at the history of food production and consumption. Whereas most historical accounts treat these matters separately, this course aims to demonstrate the intimate connections between them. Spanning from the 18th century &lsquo;agricultural revolution&rsquo;, to the late 20th century search for a &lsquo;new politics of food and farming&rsquo;, we will interrogate the linked changes in agricultural practices, the food trade, nutrition science, government policy, food consumption, food safety, and the health of humans, animals and the environment. We will also examine how these relationships were perceived at the time, and try to explain historians&rsquo; neglect of a &lsquo;farm to fork&rsquo; perspective.

  Increasingly within Whitehall and other public institutions, policy-makers are paying attention to the potential benefits of the historical discipline. It is a trend that creates both opportunities and challenges for historians. This module considers from a theoretical and practical perspective the part that history can play in public policy formation. It begins with a consideration of the concept of applied history and its methodology. It then discusses how decision-making processes function, and how history might fit into them without compromising its core values. The module then assesses the different specific openings that exist, such as public consultations, parliamentary inquiries and more informal routes, and the drafting of History   Policy papers. It then presents a series of case-studies in particular policy areas. A number of guest speakers will take part.

It will also consider the impact of the two World Wars on party politics.
 Key topics will include: political communication, the decline of the Liberal Party, the rise of the Labour Party, the impact of mass suffrage, the General Strike, the formation of the National Government, the recovery of the Conservative Party after 1922 and its hidden dominance from the mid-1930s, and party political structures during the Second World War.

  The importance and dynamic of religion is one of the most striking features of American society. But it is also surprising in that it contradicts the assumption that modern societies are secularized. The course analyzes the role of religious rhetoric in political discourse, the role of different religious pressure groups and the important Supreme Court decisions that are related to the field of religion such as Roe v. Wade. The course will discuss the concept of civil religion, the meaning of the First Amendment in U.S. constitutional history, and contemporary secularization theories. It will provide knowledge of a number of methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding how religion has influenced images of the nation, civic values, and political campaigns in the 20th century. Examining how religion has been contested provides indispensable insights into twentieth-century U.S. culture and U.S. politics.

  The French Revolution and triumph of the concept of popular sovereignty can be viewed as representing the political equivalent of splitting the atom. Positively, the immense energies released could be harnessed for a variety of purposes, from waging war to providing welfare. Negatively, they could do immense damage unless contained within political structures. Europeans, from French revolutionaries to the nation builders of the 1860s and 1870s, struggled to find constitutions that would achieve these ends.
This module looks at constitutions of the period. Teaching is organised in ten two-hour seminars. Eight of these are grouped into four pairs, arranged chronologically and illustrating developments over time and in different nations. The first seminar in each pair provides an introduction to the political context in which a particular constitution &ndash; whose text is then examined in detail the following week &ndash; came into being. The remaining two seminars include an opening seminar that sets out the main themes, and a concluding seminar that returns to these themes and makes comparisons between national traditions and also assesses developments over time.
The overall aim of this module is to analyse, within a comparative international context, the interplay between political ideas, everyday politics, political structures, and political culture. Chronologically, it spans the period from when no European state possessed a constitution to when the vast majority did. The module is centred on a close-reading of European constitutional texts, which are readily available, both in printed form and electronically, and in English translation as well as in their original languages.

  What is India? How can we understand contemporary history and politics of India in the global context? And finally, how and to what extent has science been a part of the process of making India? In this course, we will work with these three questions in Indian history for the period roughly between 1930 and the present. We begin with the impossibility of the idea of India divided under imperial rule in the interwar period, and quickly move on to trace the transformation of this landscape in the post]war period - shaped by Cold War politics and the converging interests of various international processes. Cautiously drawing a distinction between science and technology, which were relevant to the historical actors in question, the course will begin with projects promoted by the Indian National Congress and the Imperial government, followed by projects under Nehru's administration in independent India and finally work through the effects and aftermath of India's more recent history of market liberalism. An important goal for this course is to understand the landscape of state-led transformation of India through scientific education and research, while simultaneously paying close attention to responses &ndash; both critical and favourable - from the citizens of India, as well as the perception of India in the world at large.

  This course will introduce and explore the history of film and examine the ways it has reflected and refracted the shifting political and cultural significance of science and medicine in the 20th century. Drawing primarily on American sources, the module will examine a range of films, from the earliest nonfiction studies of scientist-producers who saw the motion picture camera as the perfect instrument to study science&rsquo;s hidden worlds, to government and institutional public health and propaganda films at mid-century, to Hollywood blockbusters which played out the shifting promise of (and anxieties over) science and technology in the post-World War II period, and many more. We will think through theoretical concerns, about how to read and think about films of science and medicine, which sit uncomfortably between the disciplinary concerns of the history of science, of culture and of film. But more fundamentally, we will think about what kind of narrative film offers of science and medicine in the twentieth century. What kind of instrument was the motion picture camera to its early scientific adopters, what to its late-century Hollywood producers? What do these films have to tell us about the trajectory of science and medicine in the 20th century?

  This module offers a historical and critical perspective on the making of the contemporary Muslim Question in Europe. In essence it does three things:
It places the making of the Muslim Question in the history of both the relations between European states and their Muslim populations from colonial subjecthood, through immigration regimes to postcolonial citizenship, and of the geopolitics of inter-national and transnational articulations and politics of imperial, nation state and European formations;
It takes a critical and comparative approach to the making of the Muslim Question in relation to the other (Jewish, Woman, Nationalities, Colour, Religious) &lsquo;Questions&rsquo;, their contexts, framings, and politics;
It proposes a genealogical and critical historiographical reflection on the emergence of the Muslim subject, Muslim subjectivities and political identities, and the writing of the history of Muslims in Europe and its spatial contexts.

  The historian, it has been said, is a prophet looking backwards. The dramatic and singular horrors of National Socialism have frequently led historians to search for singular and dramatic pathologies in German history before 1933. Militarism, antisemitism, a cult of technology, an introspective middle class, a lack of civic courage, overmighty industrialists: all these and more have been stressed in historiography. And certainly in the period between 1871 and 1945 many Germans, too, believed that their nation was charting a felicitous &ldquo;special path&rdquo; (Sonderweg) to modernity, a more authentic and communal journey than Britain&rsquo;s soulless Manchester capitalism or France&rsquo;s revolutionary theatrics.

  This module will offer a comprehensive overview of the Provisional IRA&rsquo;s campaign between the eruption of communal violence in Northern Ireland in August 1969 and the final decommissioning of weapons in 2005.  It covers the origins of the Provisional IRA; the evolving strategy of the organisation, including the bombing of the British &lsquo;mainland&rsquo;; the impact of British counter-insurgency operations; the prison conflict that culminated in the Hunger Strikes of 1981; the rise of Sinn F&eacute;in and the peace process of the 1990s.  At the centre of the subject is the relationship between the Provisionals and the communities in which they lived.  The module seeks to encourage students to consider IRA violence using comparative and interdisciplinary literature, drawing upon the work of anthropologists and sociologists as well as historians and scholars working on terrorism.  The approach will involve the use of primary sources where possible.

Though firmly based on the political and diplomatic documentary record, the course also addresses a wider range range of texts, including autobiographies, film and other appropriate visual material. Particular attention is paid to historiographical and methodological matters.

  This course examines American political culture in the 20th Century. It will provide an inter-disciplinary knowledge of different methods and theories to decode American political culture and a sound understanding of the concept of political culture. In thematic sections it will explore the cultural layers of the presidency, of populist and political protest movements. It examines these in the context of the ongoing processes of nation building and identity construction in the United States, especially in their connections to race, gender, popular culture, and the media. In reading U.S. political history through cultural phenomena like scandals, moral panics, and conspiracies, the course provides original insight into the unique nature of American democracy, society, and nation.
