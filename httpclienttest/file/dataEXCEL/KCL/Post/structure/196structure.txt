STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   The MA programme is designed as a one year full-time, or two year part-time taught programme which offers students the opportunity to engage critically with the field of war studies. The programme consists of a broad based multi-disciplinary curriculum.
The MA programme contains the following elements:
A compulsory module, Law and Conflict in International Society,  divided into three parts: Introduction to International Law and International Politics; Contemporary Security Issues; The Contemporary Research Agenda
Optional modules chosen from a range of possibilities (worth 80 credits in total). These may be taught exclusively by either the Department of War Studies or the School of Law, while others may be taught jointly.
To maintain a beneficial student/staff ratio in the classroom and promote effective learning, there are a limited number of student places available on each module. Please note: not every option in Law will be available to IPS students.
Each year the optional modules will vary, and we CANNOT GUARANTEE TO OFFER ALL OPTIONAL MODULES in any given year. Please see a list of typical options below. You are advised not to base your decision to join the degree programme soley on this list.
A dissertation of 15,000 words. The dissertation is to be written over the summer term. Students may choose their own topic but it must fall within the remit of the study of war and must be approved by a member of staff. Part-time students are advised to take the compulsory module in the first year of study and write the dissertation in the second year.

     
   Indicative non-core content
   Compulsory three-part module:
Introduction to International Law   International Politics
The first compulsory module aims to provide the foundation for an integrated study of international relations and international law. It seeks to do so by providing a basic introduction to the disciplines of international relations and international law. The module will embrace the most important concepts and issues in each field, treating similar areas in each discipline in parallel. The unifying element is the set of issues surrounding sovereignty and the state in both disciplines and in international life.
Contemporary Security Issues
The second compulsory module aims to link the disciplines of international politics and international law through investigation, analysis and discussion of contemporary security issues. This module complements the disciplinary study of international politics and international law by providing an opportunity to apply theory in practical exercises. The module linking the two disciplines that underpin the International Peace and Security Programme, offers a framework in which the topics discussed in discrete disciplinary terms in the first compulsory module are integrated through investigation of prominent issues of contemporary international peace and security.
The Contemporary Research Agenda
The intention in this part of the module is to be flexible, offering the opportunity to respond to emerging events and issues within the scope-of the course. This part of the module includes dissertation training sessions, role-play and practical experience workshops, presentations on current research topics and integrative workshops. This part of the compulsory module will also include a Dissertation Presentation Workshop as part of the dissertation training element over two days in Term 3. Each class member is expected to make a presentation of their work to date, it is not expected that this will be a presentation of final research findings. The presentation should last around 10-15 minutes and will be part of a panel, with questions and discussion following each panel's presentations.
     
   
   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Compulsory module; two optional modules; compulsory dissertation. Written examinations and essays. Part-time students are taught at the same time as full-time students.

  The role of open source intelligence (OSINT) has assumed increasing prominence in intelligence communities since the end of the Cold War, largely as a result of the prolific growth of OSINT sources as a result of the rapid spread of worldwide use of the Internet. This module will cover thoroughly both theoretical and practical aspects of OSINT, including OSINT collection, analysis and management methodologies. The latter will be addressed by the application of OSINT by students to study varied case studies in two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises.
This module will appeal most strongly to students taking the MA in Intelligence and International Security. However, it is anticipated that in line with the commitment of the Department of War Studies to the inter-disciplinary study of war, the module will appeal also to students on the whole range of existing MA programmes and contribute to their respective learning outcomes.
Aims:
This module aims to provide students with:
an understanding of the history, theory and use of OSINT;
a critical understanding of the difference between collection and analysis of OSINT;
specialised knowledge of the methods of collection and analysis of OSINT;
a framework for applying these methods to two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises;
practical experience of the application of these methods in both individual and group contexts;
and an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of these methods.

Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to carry out the following:
plan and organise substantial OSINT projects;
conduct highly advanced internet research, including the identification of rich sources of information, and the evaluation of the reliability and utility of sources;
synthesise information from a range of sources, using the full variety of source formats (including hard copy and verbal communications in addition to online sources);
perform a number of methods and modes of analysis;
select these methods for use according to their suitability for collected sources;
and to assess critically the theoretical rigour of their OSINT work.

      Assessment:  
      coursework;     practical/s;     
      Just as the best test of a student&rsquo;s grasp of academic scholarship is to ask the student to make his or her own small contribution in the form of an essay or dissertation, so the best test of your understanding of the salient features of conflict simulation is to ask you to design a small simulation of your own. Hence, your mark for this course depends entirely on your individual simulation project, the final version of which must be handed in by noon on Monday May 2nd (the start of the 3rd term). The project must meet the specification in all respects if it is to be accepted for assessment.
     
  All prospective students should be sure to consult this site and the associated websites for Professor Sabin&rsquo;s two latest books, to ensure that you understand what this unusual and innovative course involves.
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/people/professors/sabin/consim.aspx
 or just Google &lsquo;Sabin consim&rsquo;.
You should also consult http://www.professionalwargaming.co.uk/
 for more on Professor Sabin&acute;s role in promoting and assisting with the use of conflict simulation by military forces and defence analysts in the UK and overseas. You must be aware up front that the course is a lot of work and can take significantly more time than other courses, though past students have found it commensurately engaging and rewarding.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVESThis option course builds on a corpus of material hitherto almost entirely neglected within War Studies curricula, namely the several thousand conflict simulation board games published in recent decades which attempt to model the dynamics of past or potential campaigns. The aims of the course are as follows:
to familiarise students with the various possible mechanisms of conflict simulation, and the strengths and weaknesses of each;
to allow students to create their own original simulation of a particular historical campaign or battle of their choice;
to use simulation and modelling to encourage students to analyse the key dynamics of conflict situations, thereby gaining greater insight into the physical and human determinants of conflict;
to help develop a wide range of skills, including critical appraisal of existing simulations, detailed historical research into a specific campaign, intellectual creativity in devising and testing simulation models, legalistic clarity and precision in drafting simulation rules, and design skills in producing simulation graphics;
to allow students to practise broader transferable skills, in particular team work in a variety of contexts, familiarity with handling computer graphics, and the use of the internet to find information, disseminate ideas and receive feedback from the wider simulation community.

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security and is also available as an options module to students on other MA programmes in the Department. The purpose of the module is to examine a variety of issues in international politics where scientific and technological issues intersect with security concerns. We focus on three broad topics: missile defense and the prospect of an arms race in space; the environment as a security threat, and the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements. For each of these topics, we gain an understanding of the science involved, examine relevant social science theories and concepts, and then use these tools to anlayse the policy issues involved, with a focus on the interaction of science and politics.
Aims:
The aims of the module are to:
- familiarise students with the basic science underlying important contemporary issues in international politics
- develop a systematic understanding of the relevant concepts and theories from Security Studies, and encourage a critical awareness of the theoretical and empirical debates surrounding them
- promote the capacity for critical evaluation, independent judgment and communication at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
- foster the skills required for critical analysis of the implications of scientific and technological developments on security
- provide a framework for original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific developments in shaping security problems

Learning outcomes:

By the end of the module, students will have:
- a basic understanding of the science underlying contemporary issues in international politics
- the ability to analyse critically technical claims made in the field of international security
- an ability to provide politically-informed technical analysis in the field of science and security
- critically engaged with key concepts and theories used in security studies, and applied those concepts and theories to an analysis of current and historical security issues
- carried out original, critical analysis of the impact of scientific and technological developments on security, using knowledge of the science involved and tools drawn from IR theory and security studies
- practised a range of intellectual, practical and transferable skills, through participation in classes and through the preparation and submission of course work

  The module provides an introduction to the study of East Asian security in the contemporary world. East Asia stands out as one of the world's most dynamic regions and the module analyses how competing schools of thought identify in different political, strategic, socio-cultural and economic factors the keys to decipher the evolving nature of regional architecture and power structure.
The module focuses primarily on the area of the Eurasian continent including countries historically influenced by the Chinese civilisation, China, Japan, the two Koreas, and Taiwan. It reviews cultural assumptions and historical circumstances that shaped the security of the region in the Cold War and beyond. It investigates liberal, realist and constructivist theories of regional security and test them against issues of critical significance for regional stability such as the role of the American alliance system in the post 9/11 era, the power competition between the United States and China, and the questions of legacy and memories of World War II. Further, the module explores the influence of actors such as India, ASEAN and the European Union on regional order and power balance.
Aims:
This module aims to:
Provide students with an historical and geopolitical understanding of the different notions of East Asia;
Introduce students to the existing literature and perspectives on East Asian security;
Enhance students' ability to assess the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to regional security;
Foster the understanding and application of a range of intellectual and study skills, including critical analysis, independent judgment, as well as oral and written presentational skills and time management.

Learning outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:
Have a comprehensive understanding of the different approaches to the study of East Asian security;
Evaluate and debate theories and interpretations of East Asian security through critical and analytical analysis;
Place issues and problems concerning security in East Asia within the context of wider debates on international security affairs;
Have a substantial knowledge of the methodological issues concerning research on East Asian security;
Undertake original and independent research on questions related to international relation theories and security in East Asia.

  
    Ethics In International Relations - Optional

      Assessment:  
      coursework     
      Assessment will be by means of two written submissions. The first will consist of a 1500 word book review (or similar exercise) which will contribute 20% to the final mark for the module as a whole. The second will be an essay of 4000 words which will contribute the remaining 80% of the mark for the module as a whole. The pass mark for both pieces of work is set at 50%.
     
  This is a research based option which flows from the work conducted by Professor Frost in the field of Ethics in International Relations. The impetus for this research came from the neglect which the discipline of IR has traditionally shown towards issues to do with ethics in world politics. The central claim developed and defended in this option is that no coherent understanding of contemporary international affairs is possible without a serious and sustained engagement with a core set of ethical issues. Such engagement with ethical thought and argument is required for us to make sense of any of the following actions: actions in defence of state sovereignty, wars of national liberation, new wars, secession, humanitarian interventions, the global war against terror, international crime, international aid, development aid, and national self-determination. In recent years IR scholars have gradually paid more attention to the link between ethics and explanation in world politics. This module will introduce students to some of the key debates which have emerged in the burgeoning field of contemporary normative international relations theory.
Course Aims and ObjectivesThis module will engage students in a research based programme built around the core text written by the convenor entitled Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom and International Relations (Routledge, 2008), but will also refer to his other books, Constituting Human Rights (Routledge, 2002), Ethics in International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1996) and Towards a Normative Theory of International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1986). It also aims to engage students with the articles reprinted in Mervyn Frost (ed), International Ethics (Volumes 1- 4) (London, Sage Library of International Relations, 2011)
It will immerse students in an in-depth, historically informed study of the place of ethics in the discipline of International Relations paying particular attention to the reasons for its neglect in main stream International Relations theory as it developed in the 20th century
This option will acquaint students with the traditional literature that did take ethical issues in international affairs seriously prior to the advent of modern social scientific method in the discipline. They will consider why this body of literature was submerged by the rise of positivist social scientific approaches to IR.
It will explore the ways in which ethical matters impinge on the study of world affairs in spite of the sustained attempts by scholars to make a sharp distinction between facts and values in order to sustain the claim the IR is a scientific discipline.
It will discuss the social scientific difficulties we encounter when studying human actions (which is the material studied by IR theorists) and how these difficulties inevitably lead social scientist to engage with profound ethical issues.
Students will be lead to discover the salience of the above for our understanding and explanation of all key policy areas in international affairs from trade policy to war making.
A key aim is to teach students how to move beyond merely pointing out the salience of ethical considerations to what they do as IR scholars, to actually engaging in argument to move towards a solution of some of the pressing ethical issues of our time in the international sphere. They will be required usefully to engage with questions to do with sovereignty, just war theory, normative theories about new wars, the ethical issues produced by the global &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;, global governance, democratization, the advancement of freedom by global civil society, human rights in a world of states, and others.
Students will be invited to discuss a range of core texts by contemporary political philosophers working in this area including the work of John Rawls, Michael Walzer, Terry Nardin, Charles Beitz, Mervyn Frost, Chris Brown and others.

  The  module aims to introduce a range of analytical approaches to the study of security in Europe today and develop a detailed knowledge and understanding of the main issues and developments since the end of the Cold War. It focuses on the response of states and international organisations to the new security challenges and considers the nature of the emerging security order. It analyses the ways in which NATO, the EU and the OSCE have adapted to the post Cold War and post 9/11 security environment, the relationship between them and their respective roles in providing security. The role of the US in Europe and the debate over the future of the transatlantic security partnership will be critically explored. National perspectives on European security issues are also considered through the comparative study of the defence policies of France, Germany, the UK, Russia and a selection of other European states. The  module concludes with a number of case-studies on specific issues and regions in order to bring together both the conceptual and empirical themes of the course.

Taught by: Professor Aileen McColgan, Dr Lorenzo Zucca   Nicholas Gibson

This module considers the jurisprudential foundations of the new Act, its roots in English law and its relationship with the law and practice of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. It also subjects the Act to in-depth analysis, against the background of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. The module analyses the UK-based case law on human rights which has occurred both before and after implementation of the Human Rights Act in October 2000. It ends with a discussion of the implications of the Human Rights Act for British Law, English legal culture and the role of the judiciary.

  Aims: To foster the capacity for critical analysis of insecurity, risk, and unease, developing students' capacity for independent judgement and communication at a level commensurate with postgraduate study.
To develop an interdisciplinary approach towards questions of security, war, policing, and risk, adding to the traditional knowledge of International Relations concerning these domains, central highlights coming from political theory, history, cultural anthropology, criminology, political sociology, surveillance studies. 
To address the relationship between policing (criminal justice, intelligence, and risk assessment) and defence (war making, antiterrorist operations abroad and peace support operation) as a set of entangled practices whose boundaries are shifting with forms of policing abroad and military intelligence surveillance inside.
To  discuss the boundaries of the networks constituted by different professionals and experts of (in)security at the transnational scale and is based on a deep empirical research concerning the European Union and its transatlantic relations
To connect to International Relations theories (mainly anglo-american) a line of thought coming from French and continental theorists and sociologists, often misread as post-modern, like Bruno Latour, Ulrich Beck, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu, and tries to show how they can be operationalised methodologically for empirical research concerning (in)security
Helps students understand the relationship between agents and institutions relating to (in)security within the European Union and beyond.
Addresses the impact of these networks of (in)security professionals at the transnational scale on the capacity of the professionals of politics at the national level and within the EU context to govern effectively. 
Discusses the emergence of transnational professional guilds which destabilises the very notion of national government and national state.
Opens a discussion about contemporary dynamics of social changes seen often as globalisation, and to their relations with order, equality and freedom.
Enables also students' capacity to analyse the dynamics at works concerning (in)security, risk and unease in other different social and professional universes, including beyond coercive agents, the domains of health, environment, banking, through a reconceptualisation of what (in)security practices means and what they do.
Learning outcomes:
By the end of the  module students will be able to
Relate the theoretical and conceptual debates on security and insecurity to wider theoretical and conceptual frameworks. 
Understand of the qualities and limits of contemporary International Relations theories on this subject. 
Understand better the significance of issues raised in the module in relation to wider methodological concerns, and learn from the module how to engage in empirical research while having a background of constructivist epistemology. 
Appreciate the normative dimension of the study of (in)security regarding freedom, equality and justice, and have the capacity to understand the ethical dilemmas surrounding the (in)security dynamics.

  We will start from the prohibition to use force in international relations contained in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and will then proceed to analyse the exceptions to this prohibition: those codified in the UN Charter (self-defence, collective security) and those which are not (e.g., humanitarian intervention).
We will review and assess the basic jus ad bellum doctrines, while also examining various armed conflicts in relation to which these doctrines have been applied and shaped. For example, we will consider the doctrinal legacy left by the intervention in Kosovo and by the invasion of Iraq. Key questions to be addressed include: how should the use of force be defined for the purpose of legal regulation? What is the scope of the right of self-defence? Does self-defence cover the right to use force to protect nationals abroad, to pre-empt an attack that is not imminent, or to act against a state that is harbouring terrorists? Are interventions to further democracy or to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction legitimate exceptions to the prohibition of recourse to force? Throughout the module, you will be invited to think about jus ad bellum as a contested field in which different actors &ndash; legal advisers to foreign offices, military lawyers, international lawyers working for NGOs, legal scholars, activists and others &ndash; all play a part.

  The module explores the emergence and evolution of the Middle East system of states and its international politics since 1945, through a framework of analysis that is partly historical and partly thematic. The module is heavily based on reading seminars through which the themes discussed in lectures are explored, often in relation to current case studies. You will be expected to read an average of 140-150 pages a week. The lectures start with a survey of the emergence of the modern Middle East since the late Ottoman period, through the era of British and French imperialism, to the post-1945 independence period and the Cold War and post-Cold War eras. This is intended to demonstrate the importance of the international system in shaping the modern states and political patterns of the region, and also to reveal the importance of social structures and political economy in additionally determining inter-state behaviour. This perspective is applied to the rise of nationalism, impact of oil, and pressures to liberalize economically and politically, especially since the end of the Cold War. Sweeping social and economic transformation has moreover led to the rise of new forms of 'identity politics' that are explored in the cases of religious-nationalist Zioism and of political Islam, and to the increasing role of armed non-state actors. These themes are developed through extensive discussion of select case-studies including Iraq, Iran, and Israel and the Palestinians. The primary aim is to provide a basic ability to analyze and understand major political issues and historical processes in the Middle East. The secondary aim is to provide training in the critical reading of assigned texts and their use in analytical writing.
Aims
The aims of the module are to:
enhance student knowledge of the determinants of modern Middle East politics and state formation;
provide an analytical framework for understanding the Arab-Israeli and Gulf conflicts, intra-regional relations, the politics of oil, and the Middle East policies of the super/global powers;
allow students to develop their understanding of the role of identity politics (nationalism and religion) in inter-state politics in the region;
allow students to develop their understanding of the politics of economic and political liberalization in the Middle East in the context of globalization;
encourage critical engagement with debates about the applicability and utility of different International Relations theoretical approaches in explaining the international politics of the Middle East.
  
Learning outcomes
At the end of the module, students will be able to:
interpret and explain events in the Middle East through application of universal analytical concepts and methods;
assess critically the impact of global processes on Middle East politics, and equally to draw on the example of the Middle East to re-evaluate the international politics of other regions of the world;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the levels-of-analysis approach, questions of causality, and critical comparative perspective in International Relations thinking, including the interplay of external and internal factors in the national, regional, and international politics of states;
explain the relevance of social origins, historical context, and political economy of states to their foreign policy behaviour, affecting the nature, extent, and pace of regionalism, economic and political liberalization, and globalization;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the role of ideology and culture in international politics;
communicate effectively about these issues verbally and in writing;display research skills pertinent to the study of international politics of the Middle East.

  This course sets out to undertake a critical review of the evolving strategies for protection of the refugees under international, regional and domestic law, with particular reference to transnational legal decisions from across the world. It will examine the origins and evolution of refugee law, who is protected by international, regional and domestic refugee law, why the protection does not extend to wider groups of people (e.g. environmental refugees), and will assess the scope and limits of refugee rights. As wars rage in the Middle East and beyond, it will consider the various legal and policy impediments to asylum-seeking, who is admitted and who is not, and how transnational developments and initiatives can assist in the protection of forced migrants. Refugees are the leading trans-border issue in the world today. Yet, there is no world refugee court that can hand down authoritative decisions on refugees. All major human rights violations, such as human trafficking, religious affiliation and conscientious objection, sexual orientation and gay rights, sexual violence and female genital mutilation, and indiscriminate attacks against civilians in &lsquo;war zones&rsquo; &ndash; affect refugees and determine their numbers world-wide. Each of these issues requires transnational solutions and will be considered in this module.

  Aims
The aim of the module is to discuss all the ramifications of natural resource conflicts in developing societies and to situate these within the nexus of security and development. The  module is conceived against the increasing importance of natural resources in developing societies and the implications of the attendant conflicts to global peace. The module defines natural resources as all non-artificial products situated on or beneath the soil or rivers, which can be extracted, harvested or used and whose extraction, harvest or usage generate income or serve other functional purposes in benefiting mankind. The conflicts covered under the course include those between and within nations. Among others, the module focuses on the causes and nature of resource conflicts, their connection with local and global governance, the clash between local claims and national interest in resource politics, the link between international demand and pressures on local communities, the activities of warlords, the involvement of the international community in addressing these conflicts and the impact of globalisation on resource conflicts. The module also discusses all the contending debates on natural-resource conflicts and takes examples from across the world to illuminate the different manifestations and complexities of these conflicts. 
  
Learning outcomes:
At the end of the module, it is expected that students will be in a position to understand:
the academic issues surrounding natural resource conflicts, especially the local and international issues that determine their causes and manifestations;
the policy issues raised by these conflicts, especially the efforts by the international community like the Kimberley Process;
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and a host of others; andhow natural resource conflicts have stunted development and affected security in developing societies
  
  
Outline:
(a) Contextualising "Natural resources" and "Conflict"
(b) The conflicts over land
(c) Mineral Resources and Conflict
(d) Water, Water resources and Conflict
(e) Governance and Conflicts over natural resources
(f) Globalization and Natural Resource Conflicts

  Over the course of the past decade or so, a number of developments seemed to point to an increasing trend toward using judicial mechanisms to deal with post-conflict and transitional justice. The establishment of ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994, the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 1998, the inauguration of alternative forms of 'internationalized' justice in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Bosnia an Herzegovina, Kosovo and Cambodia and the apparent tendency toward the increased exercise of universal jurisdiction by national courts - all represented different approaches to prosecuting war crimes. Meanwhile, other processes have been tried with varying degrees of success, such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa and other combinations of truth commission and amnesty in parts of Latin America and Africa. It has also become evident that justice in a post-conflict society cannot be achieved if not pursued through rule of law and independent judiciary. 
This module examines all of these developments within a framework combining aspects of international law with aspects of international relations, and focusing on the merits and disadvantages of a range of approaches and the relationship between peace and justice.
Aims
To promote interdisciplinary understanding of issues of international law and international justice;
To encourage understanding of the interaction between politics and law in the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity;
To understand the interaction between peace, and sustainable reconciliation in divided societies;
To foster conscious critical reading and discussion of issues of peace and justice.

  Propaganda has been regarded as one of the key instruments of political practice since the beginning of the 20th century. Propaganda research played a crucial role in establishing the academic field of communication studies in the social sciences. After its heyday in the interwar and early post-cold war years, propaganda research has recently regained the attention of scholar investigating the nexus between information and warfare. This course traces the development of propaganda research over the last century up to the present day. The aim is to discover continuities and ruptures in order to conceptualise information strategies against the background of current conflicts and security issues.

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security. It is also available as an option for students on other MA programmes. The module investigates the impact of nuclear and biological weapons on international security. In order to do so, we first gain a knowledge of key concepts and theories in International Relations and Security Studies.
We then turn to the science and technology involved in these weapons. Given that acquiring fissile material is the biggest technical challenge faced by proliferators, managing the fuel cycle is key to preventing proliferation&mdash;and so it is there that we will begin. Following that, we will then look at the science of nuclear warheads, focusing on the main developments in warhead technology since the 1940s. The effects of these weapons will also be discussed and contrasted with those from radiological devices which a more likely target for non-state actors. With the potential to cause mass deaths at low cost, biological weapons have been called the 'poor man's nuclear weapon'. Emphasis will be placed on what recent developments in the biosciences, the advent and proliferation of genetic engineering techniques in particular, mean for preventing the proliferation of biological weapons. We then examine the means of delivering nuclear and biological warheads by focusing on the technology underpinning ballistic and cruise missiles and contrasting these methods with other systems.
Drawing on these two bodies of knowledge, we then use deterrence theory to analyses the impact of nuclear and biological weapons on state security. This is followed by an analysis of the political and technological challenges of attributing an attack with nuclear or biological weapons. We also investigate the threat posed by these weapons in the hands of non-state actors. Finally we conclude with an examination of two important current issues the scientific and political feasibility of 'new' nuclear weapons and the possibility of developing robust systems for verifying nuclear disarmament.
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
Familiarize students with the basic science underlying key nuclear and biological weapons and their delivery systems
Develop a systematic understand of the key concepts and theories from the fields of international relations and security studies, especially as they relate to the analysis of nuclear and biological weapons
Provide a framework for the original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific and technical issues and developments in international security
Foster the capacity of critical analysis, independent judgement and communication at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study

Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will have:
A basic understanding of the science underlying nuclear and biological weapons
An understanding of the relevance of the science to key policy problems
Critically engaged with the key concepts and theories used in security studies and applied those concepts and theories to an analysis of biological and nuclear weapons
Exercised informed and independent judgment on the primary intellectual and policy debates regarding nuclear and biological weapons
Practiced a range of intellectual, practical and transferable skills, through participation in classes and through the preparation and submission of module work

  This  module   explains the military history of the Civil War and places it in the evolution of modern warfare, as many of its central features prefigure the Two World Wars of this century. We will assess the impact of industrialisation on war, the rise in the strength of the tactical defensive, and the impact of the railways and the telegraph on strategy. A very important theme is the way that military operations were shaped by the American political system and constitutional arrangements. Students cannot understand the war adequately unless they gain an understanding of how the American Constitution works. Elections continued regardless throughout the war and thus 'the war' itself became a major political 'issue', especially in 1864. Consequently, the respective contributions to the war effort of the executive branch and Congress will be a major concern, especially the dramatic increase in the power of the executive. Contrasts with the Confederacy will be examined.

Aims: The aim of this  module is to evaluate the military conduct of the American Civil War within its general context, by relating war on the battlefield to the political and social forces that directed it. This approach is an important one because far too much Civil War history has been antiquarian in tone and context, and far too concerned with piling up detail for its own sake. A narrowly focused approach to campaign history detailing every tactical move on the battlefield irrespective of its significance while simultaneously ignoring the political and social factors that determine the conduct of war is termed 'drum and trumpet' history. Much Civil War history has taken this form, especially during the Centennial years of 1961-65. This  module   will not consist of 'drum and trumpet' history. Moreover, students will not be required to master masses of minor tactical detail that explains the course of particular battles. General issues about the war's conduct will be our main concern. Given the focus on broad themes that rest on an understanding of military operations, students should be able to demonstrate both breadth and depth of knowledge.
Objectives:
Upon successful completing the course, students will have gained an understanding of:
Why the war broke out and how political issues influenced the Civil War's conduct;
The nature of strategy and its relationship with tactics and operations;
The degree to which the Civil War was a 'modern war';
The role and character of Civil War generalship and the pressures exerted on individual commanders in a democracy.
Upon successfully completing the course, students should be in a position to:
To navigate their way around a subject which has generated a vast (although enjoyable) literature that needs to be approached with discernment
To grasp and analyse the significance of bias or special pleading in the presentation of an historical case.

  Aims:
The aim of this module will be to provide students with an understanding of contemporary military operations, in the light of economic, social, technological and political changes affecting the environment in which these operations take place. Conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa will be covered. The module will build on issues raised in the MA core and provide an opportunity for those students who wish to develop further their interest in contemporary strategic issues. Recent events - including the 'war on terror' - provide the backdrop to this module, and there is flexibility to adjust to any further developments. It is important, however, to provide perspective and to consider other types of military operation. The weekly sessions will provide the historical and analytical context for the current debates.
  
Learning outcomes:
Upon successfully completing this module, students will be reasonably familiar with:
Contemporary debates on the changing character of armed conflict, and in particular the importance of resources and identity;
The shift from interstate wars to "wars among the people";
A number of recent conflicts and their inter-connectedness;
The history and uses of terrorism;
The nature of the international jihadi groups and the world from which they spring;
The changing technology of warfare and the impact of the 'information age';
Questions of legitimacy and the role of the media and international law;
The relevance of weapons of mass destruction;
Issues of casualty intolerance and asymmetry;
The problems of research into contemporary conflicts.

  This module considers the conceptual difficulties involved with the term &lsquo;imperialism&rsquo; in understanding current and past global conflict. Taking an historical perspective on the evolution of western European empires, it challenges many current definitions. Though the British Empire necessarily looms large, the module takes a comparative approach to western empires since the fifteenth century, examining the changing motivation, method, and perceived purpose of expansion. In this way, it will assess, in particular, the role of coercion and of military asymmetry in global history to the present day.
  
    The Result In War Is Never Final - Optional

  In a little studied, though important, passage in On War, Carl von Clausewitz declared that 'in war the result is never final'. What did he mean by this? Clausewitz, it seems, was suggesting that although our common conception of war is one characterised by the clash of organised armed force, the origin of war itself is more complex. Although war may resolve major clashes of interest, does it denote the cessation of all resistance? What, when it boils down, actually is resistance as a concept? It is these ambiguous and interesting questions that this course will explore. In particular, this module focuses on how people come into conflict with ruling systems and why they choose to live in opposition to political conditions where dissent is punished and the personal costs of disputing the status quo are high? Why do they take stands against systems of rule or orthodoxy that can result in exclusion, lack of preferment, persecution or even extreme personal danger? Through academic literature, memoirs, novels and film, this module will examine the nature of dissidence and resistance with the aim of asking the fundamental question: where does the concept of war truly begin, on the battlefield, or in the mind?
Aims:
The module aims to cover the following issues and questions:
1) What does it mean to resist? Where can we situate mental resistance in the spectrum of war?
2) The nature of dissidence: who becomes a dissident and why?
3) In what political and social contexts does dissidence occur?
4) What are the personal, moral costs and dilemmas associated with dissidence?
5) What is the consequence of a study of dissidence for the understandings of war?

Learning outcomes:
On completion of this module students will have attained a knowledge and understanding of the following:
1) The complexity of the origins and the nature of war and the extent to which it can be said to originate in acts of mental resistance.
2) The nature of systems that cause resistance and dissidence.
3) The moral, ethical and political problems that dissidence and resistance can cause.
4) Why, and at what costs, does one become a dissident?
5) The role of moral conscience in politics

  From the end of the Second World and throughout the era that came to be known as the Cold War, the Middle East was a battleground for Great Power rivalries and constant wars and insurgencies. These were fought between Israelis and Arabs, Arabs and Iranians, Arabs and Arabs, local actors and foreign invaders. This module will analyse these wars and insurgencies by focusing, in particular, on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Gulf Wars and Insurgencies in the Occupied Territories, Lebanon and Iraq. The role of the superpowers &ndash; the US and the USSR &ndash; will also be examined.
Aims:

The aims of the module are to:
- provide students with the necessary concepts and tools to analyse the causes and lessons of conflicts in the Middle East, particularly between Israelis and Arabs and in the Gulf region.
- provide students with tools to analyse insurgency in the Middle East, particularly in the occupied territories, Lebanon and Iraq.
- introduce students to specific topics such as oil, water, demography, arms proliferation and more and assess its impact on conflict in the Middle East.
- introduce students to the main sources of information on war and insurgency in the Middle East.
- provide students with tools and background to enable them to critically engage with debates on war and insurgency in the Middle East.

Learning Outcomes:

A successful student will be able to:
- apply his / her understanding of the causes, conduct and lessons of war to the Middle Eastern region and analyse such case studies as the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iran-Iraq war and more.
- analyse the motives and methods of insurgency groups operating in the Middle East.
- explain how water, demography, arms proliferation and more affect conflict in the region.
- engage critically with the literature on the subject, to undertake independent research and to communicate effectively about war and insurgency issues in the Middle East to a level commensurate with MA-level study.

  This half-module offers students the chance to study the important conceptual, historical and contemporary themes within the ambit of intelligence and its relationship to the practice of warfare in the twentieth century. A particular emphasis of this module will be to illustrate the way that issues in intelligence permeate, or shade-off into, particular types of warfare and military operations characterised by covert activities, which sometimes form a specifically identifiable component within individual conflicts that can be classified as wars within wars. This module will explore how certain wars remain in the shadows and how they might be characterised as dirty wars and secret wars. The module will approach these themes utilising a strategic approach to comprehend the uses and objectives of these shadow wars and emphasise an ethical appreciation of the peculiar moral dilemmas that this particular type of war phenomenon induces.
Aims:
  
Learning Outcomes:
On completion of the module students will demonstrate:
A comprehension of the conceptual issues associated with how to define and understand intelligence related phenomena and their impact on warfare.
An appreciation of how to identify the characteristics and dynamics of conflicts that may be termed dirty war and secret war.
Through select case studies attain the ability to dissect and analyse forms of conflict that may be termed wars within wars.
An understanding of the kinds of problems and moral dilemmas generated by these forms of warfare.
