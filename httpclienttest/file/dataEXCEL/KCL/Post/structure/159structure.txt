  Global Health is a field of study, research and practice that addresses the widespread variations in health disease and medical care in different countries and regions. The global health movement argues that reducing disease, safeguarding well being and providing adequate health care requires initiatives are often beyond the capacity of individual nation states to address individually or through their domestic institutions. This module introduces students to the evidence on the social determinants of global inequalities in health, disease and medical care, and to the key concepts debates and case studies that illuminate these inequalities and the political economic social and structural forces that perpetuate them. The module provides skills in critically assessing the ways in which global health inequalities are measured and mapped and the role that governmental, institutional and corporate actors play in financing, governing and delivering health care worldwide.

  &bull; This module examines the social organisation of psychiatry as an apparatus for defining and regulating &lsquo;madness&rsquo; - and sanity.
&bull; We consider contemporary western psychiatric conceptions of mental illness and their critics, and use historical investigations to explore the complex links between psychiatric theories and practices and the emergence of &lsquo;modern&rsquo; societies.
&bull; We consider the birth of the asylum system in the nineteenth century and its relation to the development of modern, urban and industrial forms of life and cultural norms of conduct.
&bull; We explore &lsquo;colonial&rsquo; psychiatry, and its role in the management of conduct in the colonies. We examine the transformation of the psychiatric system in the first half of the twentieth century, with the discovery of &lsquo;the neuroses&rsquo; and a &lsquo;psychiatrisation of everyday life&rsquo;.
&bull; We analyse further major changes in psychiatry over the last twenty five years: the moves towards &lsquo;community psychiatry&rsquo; and the management of risk; the rise of biological explanations and treatments of mental disorder; the transnational spread of psychiatric medications such as tranquillisers and antidepressants.
&bull; We explore the globalization of psychiatry, considering both the rise of &lsquo;transcultural&rsquo; psychiatry, and the recent scholarship on the spread of &lsquo;western&rsquo; categories and practices to other societies and cultures.
&bull; Throughout the module, our focus will be on the relations of knowledge, power and expertise in psychiatry in different cultures, upon the ways in which psychiatry has operated as a means of social regulation, and upon the role of psychiatry in the cultural construction of normality and abnormality.

  This module enables students to understand social science perspectives on the contemporary bioeconomy. Spanning both industrialised nations and the emerging economies of Asia Pacific, it will explore how the biomedical research enterprise is being reshaped by governments and corporations as they search for competitive advantage in an increasingly global bioeconomy.
The module is interdisciplinary drawing inter alia on science and technology studies, socio-legal studies and political economy. Topics covered will include: the emergence of the idea of a knowledge-based economy, and its function as part of the neoliberal state project (the shift from government to governance); the concept of promissory science and the promotion of biotechnology as a &lsquo;frontier technology&rsquo;; the formation of public policy through processes of multi-level governance at the local, national and transnational levels; the intersection between public policy and commercial strategy, and the changing relationships between governments, corporations and academic scientists; the globalisation of academic research and corporate R D; the role of regulation as a both a response to and a shaper of biotechnologies; the importance of intellectual property rights in the bioeconomy, the legalisation of patents on novel life-based technologies and the globalisation of the IP regime favoured by Western pharmaceutical companies through the TRIPS agreement; and the public health consequences of focusing biomedical R D on emergent biotechnologies

  We seem to live in a world of disasters and emergencies, with one crisis piling on another. In this module we explore the contemporary politics of disasters and emergencies and we examine how critical events garner attention and galvanize social and political action. Rather than take disasters and emergencies as presumably self-evident events for granted, we explore disasters and emergencies as a social imaginary, and that is to say, as a particular way of perceiving the world. This perception is now at the heart of an expanding industry of emergency management and disaster relief. In this module we analyze this global industry, using anthropological, sociological, and historical approaches. How have disasters and emergencies contributed to the rethinking and reshaping of what political action means today? How has the temporality of emergency affected the perception of social and political problems?
Aims
&#61607; To describe the key actors and institutions as well as discourses and practices that seek to address contemporary health crises.
&#61607; To introduce students to the key concepts and debates in anthropological, sociological, and historical studies of disasters and emergencies.
&#61607; To give students the abilities to analyze emergency relief and disaster prevention from a critical point of view.
&#61607; To provide students with an understanding of the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic factors that shape the perception of disasters and emergencies.
&#61607; To provide students with the skills to critically evaluate humanitarian interventions and to identify the role of key stakeholders in shaping them.

  This module examines the phenomenon of war related violence, destruction, distress, and trauma-related health problems, health-seeking and healing practices. We will follow and discuss the debates of researchers who have tried to determine and verify the effects of violent conflict on the mental health of those affected by focusing on concepts like war trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social suffering, and idioms of distress. We will problematize conventional and universal understandings of trauma, and disease-centered approaches to traumatic experience and health interventions.
Class sessions will involve lectures, guest lectures, student presentations, discussions, film screenings, and review activities. To involve students in their own learning, make seminar topics come alive, to deepen students&rsquo; knowledge of a topic, and to develop particular skills, questions which stimulate critical thinking, annotated suggestions for further readings, and lists of related websites will be provided.
Aims
&bull; To introduce students to key concepts and debates around war trauma and relevant interventions.
&bull; To approach mental health and wars from an interdisciplinary angle by reviewing the publications of work in the fields of medicine, public health, psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, history and philosophy.
&bull; To develop an understanding of theories of and approaches related to the key concepts related to war, mental health and healing.
&bull; To synthesise, compare, and critically discuss key concepts, academic debates, research approaches and relevant ethnographic studies.
