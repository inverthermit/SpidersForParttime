  The compulsory module, 'Security and Development' provides an analytical and empirically informed treatment of the linkages between issues of security and development in contemporary international relations. Throughout the module particular emphasis is placed on the need to examine issues of security and development in their mutual interaction rather than as separate areas of academic enquiry and policy-making. The module is divided into four sections:
  
The Process of Development, War and Social Violence. This part of the course introduces students to the major debates within the fields of Sociology, Development Studies and International Relations concerning the process of development and its relationship to violent conflict and change. In particular, it explores competing claims regarding the causal connections between processes of socio-economic change and the incidence and patterns of violent conflict in the developing world. 
Security and Development Issues During Conflict. The course is also centrally concerned with the impact of violent conflict on development and, conversely, how different levels or states of development influence the nature and character of contemporary armed conflict. Issues covered in this part of the course include, inter alia, state failure and war; the political economy of civil wars; food security, famines and war; and natural resources, scarcity and armed conflict.
Security and Development Issues in Transitions from War to Peace. This part of the course explores the linkages between issues of security and development in the aftermath of violent conflict. Detailed attention will be given to areas of outside involvement - e.g. the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of combatants - where historical and contemporary experience suggests that security and development need to be thought of as mutually dependent, not distinct and separate, fields of policy intervention. Special attention is also given to contemporary forms of international administration of war torn societies.
Policy Making for Development and Security. This component focuses on the manner in which questions of security and development have been addressed by policy-makers within and among donor countries, by global and regional organisations, and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Particular emphasis is placed on the UN &ldquo;system&rdquo; and the role of the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund).

Aims:
The aims of the compulsory module, 'Security and Development' are to provide:
  
A conceptual framework in which to understand the linkages between security and development in contemporary international relations.
An understanding, informed by historical and contemporary cases studies of armed conflict in the developing world, of how different levels, trajectories and processes of development may serve either to generate and exacerbate violent conflict or, alternatively, to prevent and mitigate it.
An understanding of the manner in which specific development challenges before, during and after armed conflict also raise wider questions of international security.
An appreciation of the particular policy challenges and dilemmas generated by the interdependence of security and development issues in international affairs.
  
  
Learning outcomes:
On completion of the module students will demonstrate:
  
A thorough comprehension of the methodological issues associated with the study of security and development. 
A clear comprehension of the developmental sources of armed conflict, the political economy of civil wars, and the wider relationship of development to issues of international peace and security.
An awareness of the ways in which both the development and the security policies of external actors (individual states and/or international organisations) may influence, for better or worse, the nature and character of a given conflict. 
A detailed understanding of the ways in which security and development issues are related in a range of historical and contemporary cases.
An overall appreciation of the demanding challenges and debates confronting issues of security and development in both historical and contemporary settings to be shown through the ability to critically engage with the literature on the subject.

  War is a key aspect of human experience, and people have long sought to understand it from a diverse range of perspectives. Students of war are drawn from the ranks of historians, social scientists, philosophers, jurists and artists. Practitioners of war find instrumental value in its study. These, and others, have brought their particular insights and concerns to bear on the subject, with the result that many aspects of war are now understood from a variety of highly specialised standpoints. However, the study of war from any single standpoint, or through the lens of any one academic discipline, inevitably produces a narrow perspective which cannot accommodate war's complexities. Individual issues are elucidated, but we remain a long way from understanding war 'in the round'. Such a goal demands a different, more holistic, approach.
This   module is designed to meet such a demand by introducing a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of war. It will provide an intellectual 'toolbox', whose contents are drawn from a variety of disciplines associated with the humanities and social sciences. Students will not be trained as specialist historians, philosophers, sociologists, etc., but they will be introduced to those aspects of their disciplines which are most germane to war studies.
Another important function of this  module is to introduce students to the substantive concerns which comprise war studies. War studies is not simply strategic studies or military history by another name. Its concerns include the strategic and historical dimensions of war, but they encompass much else besides. Given the broad-ranging nature of war studies, and the correspondingly wide range of concerns that might conceivably merit attention, it is important that students gain a feel for those issues which have made it onto the war studies 'agenda' in practice. To this end, much of the course is organised around a selection of 'key' texts which are broadly representative of the larger literature encompassed by war studies. Familiarisation with the field of war studies will be greatly facilitated by a close engagement with these texts, a number of which enjoy classic status. Note, however, that none of them was selected because it contains the 'truth' about any particular aspect of war studies. Students are encouraged to engage with them critically: accepting whatever stands up to reasoned argument, and rejecting whatever does not.

The aims of this module are to:
familiarize students with a selection of the debates, issues and literatures that War Studies encompasses;
familiarize students with the multi-disciplinary approach associated with War Studies, and to encourage its practise in appropriate contexts;
provide students with a common point of departure from which to explore selected aspects of War Studies more fully, in option modules and (for MA students) in the dissertation element;
foster amongst students the capacity for analysis, judgement and communication at a level commensurate with postgraduate study.

Learning outcomes
Upon successfully completing this module, students will have:
gained an understanding of the phenomenon of war, along with its causes, conduct and consequences, as revealed through a variety of disciplinary lenses;
critically engaged with a range of literature encompassed by War Studies;
gained an understanding of the value associated with a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of war, through its practise in specific instances;
practised a range of intellectual, practical and transferable skills, through participation in classes and through the preparation and submission of course work.

      Assessment:  
      coursework     
      The module will be assessed in two distinct ways:
Sixty per cent (60%) of marks will be based on one 3,000 word essay. This essay will allow students to explore specific themes raised during the module and develop the capacity for specialisation and focused research.
Forty per cent (40%) of marks will be based on one 2,000 word practical case study. Students will develop a collection strategy and conduct preliminary analysis on a topic to be agreed in advance with the course convenors.

     
  The role of open source intelligence (OSINT) has assumed increasing prominence in intelligence communities since the end of the Cold War, largely as a result of the prolific growth of OSINT sources as a result of the rapid spread of worldwide use of the Internet. This module will cover thoroughly both theoretical and practical aspects of OSINT, including OSINT collection, analysis and management methodologies. The latter will be addressed by the application of OSINT by students to study varied case studies in two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises.
This module will appeal most strongly to students taking the MA in Intelligence and International Security. However, it is anticipated that in line with the commitment of the Department of War Studies to the inter-disciplinary study of war, the module will appeal also to students on the whole range of existing MA programmes and contribute to their respective learning outcomes.
Aims:
This module aims to provide students with:
an understanding of the history, theory and use of OSINT;
a critical understanding of the difference between collection and analysis of OSINT;
specialised knowledge of the methods of collection and analysis of OSINT;
a framework for applying these methods to two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises;
practical experience of the application of these methods in both individual and group contexts;
and an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of these methods.

Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to carry out the following:
plan and organise substantial OSINT projects;
conduct highly advanced internet research, including the identification of rich sources of information, and the evaluation of the reliability and utility of sources;
synthesise information from a range of sources, using the full variety of source formats (including hard copy and verbal communications in addition to online sources);
perform a number of methods and modes of analysis;
select these methods for use according to their suitability for collected sources;
and to assess critically the theoretical rigour of their OSINT work.

  Drawing upon a range of historical and contemporary case studies, the course provides a comparative and empirically informed examination of the origins, characteristics and dynamics of civil wars. It explores competing theories about the causes of civil wars and is concerned with the difficulties of bringing such wars to an end. Special attention is given to the role of international organisations, international law and outside military intervention in the mitigation, regulation and resolution of contemporary civil wars. The case studies examined include the Spanish Civil War (1936-39); the Angolan (1974-2001) and Mozambican (1977-1992) civil wars; Liberia and Sierra Leone (1991-2001); Iraq (2004-2007); Lebanon (1965-90); the Balkans (1991-95) and Syria (2011-).
The aims of the module are to provide:
a conceptual framework in which to understand the place of civil war and internal conflict in contemporary international relations;
an understanding, informed by historical and contemporary cases studies, of how civil wars start, spread, mutate and are brought to an end;
an understanding of how international organisations, international law, mediation and foreign intervention have influenced the course of civil wars;
an appreciation of the policy challenges and dilemmas generated by the persistence of civil war in the international system.

      Just as the best test of a student&rsquo;s grasp of academic scholarship is to ask the student to make his or her own small contribution in the form of an essay or dissertation, so the best test of your understanding of the salient features of conflict simulation is to ask you to design a small simulation of your own. Hence, your mark for this course depends entirely on your individual simulation project, the final version of which must be handed in by noon on Monday May 2nd (the start of the 3rd term). The project must meet the specification in all respects if it is to be accepted for assessment.
     
  All prospective students should be sure to consult this site and the associated websites for Professor Sabin&rsquo;s two latest books, to ensure that you understand what this unusual and innovative course involves.

 or just Google &lsquo;Sabin consim&rsquo;.
You should also consult http://www.professionalwargaming.co.uk/
 for more on Professor Sabin&acute;s role in promoting and assisting with the use of conflict simulation by military forces and defence analysts in the UK and overseas. You must be aware up front that the course is a lot of work and can take significantly more time than other courses, though past students have found it commensurately engaging and rewarding.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVESThis option course builds on a corpus of material hitherto almost entirely neglected within War Studies curricula, namely the several thousand conflict simulation board games published in recent decades which attempt to model the dynamics of past or potential campaigns. The aims of the course are as follows:
to familiarise students with the various possible mechanisms of conflict simulation, and the strengths and weaknesses of each;
to allow students to create their own original simulation of a particular historical campaign or battle of their choice;
to use simulation and modelling to encourage students to analyse the key dynamics of conflict situations, thereby gaining greater insight into the physical and human determinants of conflict;
to help develop a wide range of skills, including critical appraisal of existing simulations, detailed historical research into a specific campaign, intellectual creativity in devising and testing simulation models, legalistic clarity and precision in drafting simulation rules, and design skills in producing simulation graphics;
to allow students to practise broader transferable skills, in particular team work in a variety of contexts, familiarity with handling computer graphics, and the use of the internet to find information, disseminate ideas and receive feedback from the wider simulation community.

  British Defence Policy has been going through an unprecedented period of operational challenge in the last few years and particularly in the last half dozen years. Until the launch of the previous Government's Defence Review in September 2009 there had been very little discussion of the direction and shape of British defence policy outside of the Ministry of Defence and the armed services. Decisions with enormous implications for future generations have been taken with little or no public engagement with the debates. As casualties have risen in Iraq and Afghanistan a campaign to draw attention to the pay and conditions of service personnel and their families has re-opened a debate on the concept of a military covenant between the state and the armed forces which continues. At the same time defence policy has begun to be seen as a component of a broader National Security Strategy with significant implications for future funding models and modes of delivery.
  
While the current preoccupation is on on-going operational commitments in the Middle East and Central Asia, significant problems in equipment procurement continue to dog the British defence establishment with claims of enormous gaps in the defence budget provision for existing equipment programmes and future requirements. The Government has embarked upon a 'strategic defence and security review' which is due to report in he autumn of 2010. This module will consider these and other issues in the historical context of British defence policy and in light of current debates.
  
Aims:
This aims of the  module are to:
- provide a framework for understanding and analysing the formulation and delivery of defence policy in the UK;
- foster the skills required for analysis of the various influences on defence policy formulation;
- develop a comprehensive appreciation of the relationship between government, the military and commercial organisations in the delivery of defence capability;
- highlight how commercial calculations affects political decisions and public discourse; and,
- promote an understanding of the impact of new technology on the future of British defence policy.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to demonstrate:
- an understanding of the key issues facing current British defence policy makers;
- a critical engagement in the methodological questions associated with the study of defence policy making;
- an understanding of the historical context of existing defence policy;
- the ability to evaluate the conflicting pressures on the armed services; and,
- an ability to engage critically with the literature on the subject, to undertake independent research and to exercise informed judgement on current security issues.

  Counterterrorism is one of the most prominent and contentious issues in security policy today. This module aims to provide a comparative understanding of contemporary counterterrorist organisations, operations and legislation in leading European countries and the United States. On this basis, we will analyse and debate the balance between liberty and security in counterterrorism; and the relative merits of hard power and soft power in responses to terrorism. The module also considers questions such as: why do states often respond to terrorism in different ways; what makes for an effective counterterrorist response?; and is terrorism an effective strategy for coercing governments?
  
The module aims to provide:

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security and is also available as an options module to students on other MA programmes in the Department. The purpose of the module is to examine a variety of issues in international politics where scientific and technological issues intersect with security concerns. We focus on three broad topics: missile defense and the prospect of an arms race in space; the environment as a security threat, and the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements. For each of these topics, we gain an understanding of the science involved, examine relevant social science theories and concepts, and then use these tools to anlayse the policy issues involved, with a focus on the interaction of science and politics.
Aims:
The aims of the module are to:
- familiarise students with the basic science underlying important contemporary issues in international politics
- develop a systematic understanding of the relevant concepts and theories from Security Studies, and encourage a critical awareness of the theoretical and empirical debates surrounding them
- promote the capacity for critical evaluation, independent judgment and communication at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
- foster the skills required for critical analysis of the implications of scientific and technological developments on security
- provide a framework for original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific developments in shaping security problems

Learning outcomes:

By the end of the module, students will have:
- a basic understanding of the science underlying contemporary issues in international politics
- the ability to analyse critically technical claims made in the field of international security
- an ability to provide politically-informed technical analysis in the field of science and security
- critically engaged with key concepts and theories used in security studies, and applied those concepts and theories to an analysis of current and historical security issues
- carried out original, critical analysis of the impact of scientific and technological developments on security, using knowledge of the science involved and tools drawn from IR theory and security studies

  The module provides an introduction to the study of East Asian security in the contemporary world. East Asia stands out as one of the world's most dynamic regions and the module analyses how competing schools of thought identify in different political, strategic, socio-cultural and economic factors the keys to decipher the evolving nature of regional architecture and power structure.
The module focuses primarily on the area of the Eurasian continent including countries historically influenced by the Chinese civilisation, China, Japan, the two Koreas, and Taiwan. It reviews cultural assumptions and historical circumstances that shaped the security of the region in the Cold War and beyond. It investigates liberal, realist and constructivist theories of regional security and test them against issues of critical significance for regional stability such as the role of the American alliance system in the post 9/11 era, the power competition between the United States and China, and the questions of legacy and memories of World War II. Further, the module explores the influence of actors such as India, ASEAN and the European Union on regional order and power balance.

      Assessment:  
      coursework     
      Assessment will be by means of two written submissions. The first will consist of a 1500 word book review (or similar exercise) which will contribute 20% to the final mark for the module as a whole. The second will be an essay of 4000 words which will contribute the remaining 80% of the mark for the module as a whole. The pass mark for both pieces of work is set at 50%.
     
  This is a research based option which flows from the work conducted by Professor Frost in the field of Ethics in International Relations. The impetus for this research came from the neglect which the discipline of IR has traditionally shown towards issues to do with ethics in world politics. The central claim developed and defended in this option is that no coherent understanding of contemporary international affairs is possible without a serious and sustained engagement with a core set of ethical issues. Such engagement with ethical thought and argument is required for us to make sense of any of the following actions: actions in defence of state sovereignty, wars of national liberation, new wars, secession, humanitarian interventions, the global war against terror, international crime, international aid, development aid, and national self-determination. In recent years IR scholars have gradually paid more attention to the link between ethics and explanation in world politics. This module will introduce students to some of the key debates which have emerged in the burgeoning field of contemporary normative international relations theory.
Course Aims and ObjectivesThis module will engage students in a research based programme built around the core text written by the convenor entitled Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom and International Relations (Routledge, 2008), but will also refer to his other books, Constituting Human Rights (Routledge, 2002), Ethics in International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1996) and Towards a Normative Theory of International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1986). It also aims to engage students with the articles reprinted in Mervyn Frost (ed), International Ethics (Volumes 1- 4) (London, Sage Library of International Relations, 2011)
It will immerse students in an in-depth, historically informed study of the place of ethics in the discipline of International Relations paying particular attention to the reasons for its neglect in main stream International Relations theory as it developed in the 20th century
This option will acquaint students with the traditional literature that did take ethical issues in international affairs seriously prior to the advent of modern social scientific method in the discipline. They will consider why this body of literature was submerged by the rise of positivist social scientific approaches to IR.
It will explore the ways in which ethical matters impinge on the study of world affairs in spite of the sustained attempts by scholars to make a sharp distinction between facts and values in order to sustain the claim the IR is a scientific discipline.
It will discuss the social scientific difficulties we encounter when studying human actions (which is the material studied by IR theorists) and how these difficulties inevitably lead social scientist to engage with profound ethical issues.
Students will be lead to discover the salience of the above for our understanding and explanation of all key policy areas in international affairs from trade policy to war making.
A key aim is to teach students how to move beyond merely pointing out the salience of ethical considerations to what they do as IR scholars, to actually engaging in argument to move towards a solution of some of the pressing ethical issues of our time in the international sphere. They will be required usefully to engage with questions to do with sovereignty, just war theory, normative theories about new wars, the ethical issues produced by the global &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;, global governance, democratization, the advancement of freedom by global civil society, human rights in a world of states, and others.
Students will be invited to discuss a range of core texts by contemporary political philosophers working in this area including the work of John Rawls, Michael Walzer, Terry Nardin, Charles Beitz, Mervyn Frost, Chris Brown and others.

  Human Rights and Migration adopts a socio-legal approach to questions relating migration and human rights. In doing do, it stresses the significance of political context in the construction of legal frameworks dealing with the politically charged question of the movement of peoples across national boundaries and examines these in relation to the agencies and institutions of the European Union. Each session considers the theoretical issue relating to human rights and migration, how the question is dealt with in international treaties, and what the implications are for migrants.
  
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
To promote in students an advanced understanding of the relationship between human rights law and the movement of people across national boundaries.  The focus throughout will be on the interrelationships both supportive and conflictual between the domestic law within states dealing with migration, EU law and International Law.
Unpack the international legal framework in relation to contemporary ethical ideas about individual identity, belonging and citizenship.  This will involve students moving beyond "black letter" law to a study of the ethical values which underpin it.
Set out the legal framework governing the refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union as they were originally set up and the transformations which have been taking place in the post Cold War and in the globalizing environment. 
Expose students to cutting edge analyses which examine the political forces influencing the legal changes mentioned in point 3 above
Explore the ways in which forced migration is being dealt with in national and international law.Make explicit the opportunities which exist in domestic, EU and International law for migrants to seek remedies which will protect their fundamental human rights in the face of hostile political forces.  In doing this detailed consideration will be given to recent developments in the case law pertaining to these matters.
Study the links between human rights law, family law and migration.
Explore the economic outcomes of migration and how it has affected human rights law.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:
Relate concepts of human rights to the   movement of peoples across national boundaries as these have been defined   in and controlled by law.
Specify the   complex legal framework within which our modern ideas of identity, belonging,   and citizenship are located.
Understand the legal framework relating to   refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union and the   transformations taking place therein.    In doing this students will be able to demonstrate an ability to   find their way around a complicated knowledge base which includes law   reports, constitutions, legal text books, works in the field of   international relations and also reports in the quality press.
Appreciate the political context surrounding   the complex relationship between human rights and migration policies   within the European context.
Engage with some of the thorny ethical issues   which are raised by the legal and political disputes surrounding the   problems of migration.
Understand and analyse the issue of forced   migration and the protection of refugees under international human rights   law.
Understand the question of rights and how this   relates to family life across national boundaries.Assess the impact of economic migration on   human rights law
Demonstrate skill in articulating the complex   interrelationships between law, politics and ethics as they pertain to   issues to do with migration across national borders.  These skills are likely to prove useful   to students in their subsequent careers and as citizens.

  This is a research based option which flows from the work conducted by Professor Frost in the field of Human Rights in a World of States. The impetus for this research came from the neglect which the discipline of IR has traditionally shown towards issues to do with human rights in world politics. The central claim developed and defended in this option is that no coherent understanding of contemporary international affairs is possible without a serious and sustained engagement with a core set of human rights related issues. In particular it is no longer possible to comprehend contemporary international relations without understanding the place of human rights considerations in present day international practices. Purely state-centric analyses are no longer coherent. Such engagement with a rights based discourse is required of us in order to make sense of any of the following actions: actions in defence of state sovereignty, wars of national liberation, new wars, secession, intervention, the war against terror, international crime, international aid, development aid, national self-determination. In recent years IR scholars have gradually started including sections on human rights in their publications. This course aims to bring a rights based focus into the centre of IR scholarship.

  Aims: To foster the capacity for critical analysis of insecurity, risk, and unease, developing students' capacity for independent judgement and communication at a level commensurate with postgraduate study.
To develop an interdisciplinary approach towards questions of security, war, policing, and risk, adding to the traditional knowledge of International Relations concerning these domains, central highlights coming from political theory, history, cultural anthropology, criminology, political sociology, surveillance studies. 
To address the relationship between policing (criminal justice, intelligence, and risk assessment) and defence (war making, antiterrorist operations abroad and peace support operation) as a set of entangled practices whose boundaries are shifting with forms of policing abroad and military intelligence surveillance inside.
To  discuss the boundaries of the networks constituted by different professionals and experts of (in)security at the transnational scale and is based on a deep empirical research concerning the European Union and its transatlantic relations
To connect to International Relations theories (mainly anglo-american) a line of thought coming from French and continental theorists and sociologists, often misread as post-modern, like Bruno Latour, Ulrich Beck, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu, and tries to show how they can be operationalised methodologically for empirical research concerning (in)security
Helps students understand the relationship between agents and institutions relating to (in)security within the European Union and beyond.
Addresses the impact of these networks of (in)security professionals at the transnational scale on the capacity of the professionals of politics at the national level and within the EU context to govern effectively. 
Discusses the emergence of transnational professional guilds which destabilises the very notion of national government and national state.
Opens a discussion about contemporary dynamics of social changes seen often as globalisation, and to their relations with order, equality and freedom.
Enables also students' capacity to analyse the dynamics at works concerning (in)security, risk and unease in other different social and professional universes, including beyond coercive agents, the domains of health, environment, banking, through a reconceptualisation of what (in)security practices means and what they do.
Learning outcomes:
By the end of the  module students will be able to
Relate the theoretical and conceptual debates on security and insecurity to wider theoretical and conceptual frameworks. 
Understand of the qualities and limits of contemporary International Relations theories on this subject. 
Understand better the significance of issues raised in the module in relation to wider methodological concerns, and learn from the module how to engage in empirical research while having a background of constructivist epistemology. 
Appreciate the normative dimension of the study of (in)security regarding freedom, equality and justice, and have the capacity to understand the ethical dilemmas surrounding the (in)security dynamics.

  
    International Politics Of The Middle East - Optional

  The module explores the emergence and evolution of the Middle East system of states and its international politics since 1945, through a framework of analysis that is partly historical and partly thematic. The module is heavily based on reading seminars through which the themes discussed in lectures are explored, often in relation to current case studies. You will be expected to read an average of 140-150 pages a week. The lectures start with a survey of the emergence of the modern Middle East since the late Ottoman period, through the era of British and French imperialism, to the post-1945 independence period and the Cold War and post-Cold War eras. This is intended to demonstrate the importance of the international system in shaping the modern states and political patterns of the region, and also to reveal the importance of social structures and political economy in additionally determining inter-state behaviour. This perspective is applied to the rise of nationalism, impact of oil, and pressures to liberalize economically and politically, especially since the end of the Cold War. Sweeping social and economic transformation has moreover led to the rise of new forms of 'identity politics' that are explored in the cases of religious-nationalist Zioism and of political Islam, and to the increasing role of armed non-state actors. These themes are developed through extensive discussion of select case-studies including Iraq, Iran, and Israel and the Palestinians. The primary aim is to provide a basic ability to analyze and understand major political issues and historical processes in the Middle East. The secondary aim is to provide training in the critical reading of assigned texts and their use in analytical writing.
Aims
The aims of the module are to:
enhance student knowledge of the determinants of modern Middle East politics and state formation;
provide an analytical framework for understanding the Arab-Israeli and Gulf conflicts, intra-regional relations, the politics of oil, and the Middle East policies of the super/global powers;
allow students to develop their understanding of the role of identity politics (nationalism and religion) in inter-state politics in the region;
allow students to develop their understanding of the politics of economic and political liberalization in the Middle East in the context of globalization;
encourage critical engagement with debates about the applicability and utility of different International Relations theoretical approaches in explaining the international politics of the Middle East.
  
Learning outcomes
At the end of the module, students will be able to:
interpret and explain events in the Middle East through application of universal analytical concepts and methods;
assess critically the impact of global processes on Middle East politics, and equally to draw on the example of the Middle East to re-evaluate the international politics of other regions of the world;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the levels-of-analysis approach, questions of causality, and critical comparative perspective in International Relations thinking, including the interplay of external and internal factors in the national, regional, and international politics of states;
explain the relevance of social origins, historical context, and political economy of states to their foreign policy behaviour, affecting the nature, extent, and pace of regionalism, economic and political liberalization, and globalization;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the role of ideology and culture in international politics;
communicate effectively about these issues verbally and in writing;display research skills pertinent to the study of international politics of the Middle East.

  The public's 'right to know' and the government's need for secrecy in its military and counter-terrorism operations characterise the core problem in the relationship between governments and media in liberal democracies. This module explores an even more tenuous relationship by focusing on the tensions as well as interdependencies between the intelligence and the journalistic communities. It explores the role media products play as an 'open source' in the intelligence cycle, how intelligence services 'use' the media to influence public perceptions and, finally, how journalists report &ndash; or fail to report &ndash; the activities of intelligence services. It will also critically reflect on the impact of New Media on the intelligence community and how it is represented in mainstream media and popular culture.
Aims:

- a critical engagement with the political and ethical dimensions of the media on the one hand and intelligence services on the other
- an appreciation of the institutional developments of open source intelligence gathering and its role in the intelligence cycle
- a framework for understanding and analysing the impact of information operations on the media in times of war
- a critical appreciation of the relationship between government, the intelligence community and the media
- an awareness of how open source intelligence provided by the media affects intelligence reports and political decisions
- a systematic investigation of the challenges media and intelligence professionals face because of the emergence of New Media
- critical analysis, independent judgement, oral and written presentation at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
Learning Outcomes:

- an in-depth knowledge of the role of media as a source of intelligence on two historical cases: World War II and the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan
- a critical engagement in the methodological questions associated with the study of intelligence and the media
- a reflexive understanding of the dynamics of the relationship between journalists and the intelligence services in liberal democracies
- an ability to analyse critically issues arising from intelligence services' attempt to use the media in information campaigns
- a critical awareness of the new challenges for journalists and intelligence analysts with the rise of internet and new social media networks
- an ability to engage critically with the literature on the subject and to undertake independent research

  Trench warfare is one of the most distinct, prolonged and damaging combat experiences in the history of warfare. As such the western front in the first world war will forever be remembered as the epitome of futile military slaughter, with its killing on an industrial scale, its stalemated tactics and strategy, and its deep psychological effect on the surviving combatants. All too often however, the 'trench experience' is dismissed without being understood: this course explores the reality of trench life and combat; the reasons why men continued to fight in such circumstances, and the psychological and medical responses to the strain of prolonged trench warfare, so called 'shell shock'. It takes as its source material contemporary letters, diaries and memoirs of combat, post-war literature and history, and scholarly academic assessments of the nature of combat in the first world war.
  
  
Aims:
To introduce students to the nature, impact and understanding of combat in the first world war, particularly on the western front
To explain the relationship between combat experience, military morale and psychological trauma in the first world war
To investigate medical responses to the new phenomenon of 'shell shock' 
To promote reflexive engagement with the variety of contemporary and secondary sources for studying combat experience in the first world war
To promote critical analysis of scholarly writings on the experience and impact of combat in the first world warto develop students' ability to engage in critical analysis, independent judgement and oral and written presentation at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
  
  
Objectives:
A student who successfully completes this module will:
Understand the nature and impact of combat on the western front in the first world warBe able to critically evaluate the factors which affected military morale, discipline and soldier's psychological health in trench warfare
Be able to reflect critically on scholarly analysis of the nature, impact and memory of first world war combat, using contemporary and post-war accounts of the experience of combat

  Aims
The aim of the module is to discuss all the ramifications of natural resource conflicts in developing societies and to situate these within the nexus of security and development. The  module is conceived against the increasing importance of natural resources in developing societies and the implications of the attendant conflicts to global peace. The module defines natural resources as all non-artificial products situated on or beneath the soil or rivers, which can be extracted, harvested or used and whose extraction, harvest or usage generate income or serve other functional purposes in benefiting mankind. The conflicts covered under the course include those between and within nations. Among others, the module focuses on the causes and nature of resource conflicts, their connection with local and global governance, the clash between local claims and national interest in resource politics, the link between international demand and pressures on local communities, the activities of warlords, the involvement of the international community in addressing these conflicts and the impact of globalisation on resource conflicts. The module also discusses all the contending debates on natural-resource conflicts and takes examples from across the world to illuminate the different manifestations and complexities of these conflicts. 
  
Learning outcomes:
At the end of the module, it is expected that students will be in a position to understand:
the academic issues surrounding natural resource conflicts, especially the local and international issues that determine their causes and manifestations;
the policy issues raised by these conflicts, especially the efforts by the international community like the Kimberley Process;
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and a host of others; andhow natural resource conflicts have stunted development and affected security in developing societies
  
  
Outline:
(a) Contextualising "Natural resources" and "Conflict"
(b) The conflicts over land
(c) Mineral Resources and Conflict
(d) Water, Water resources and Conflict

  Over the course of the past decade or so, a number of developments seemed to point to an increasing trend toward using judicial mechanisms to deal with post-conflict and transitional justice. The establishment of ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994, the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 1998, the inauguration of alternative forms of 'internationalized' justice in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Bosnia an Herzegovina, Kosovo and Cambodia and the apparent tendency toward the increased exercise of universal jurisdiction by national courts - all represented different approaches to prosecuting war crimes. Meanwhile, other processes have been tried with varying degrees of success, such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa and other combinations of truth commission and amnesty in parts of Latin America and Africa. It has also become evident that justice in a post-conflict society cannot be achieved if not pursued through rule of law and independent judiciary. 
This module examines all of these developments within a framework combining aspects of international law with aspects of international relations, and focusing on the merits and disadvantages of a range of approaches and the relationship between peace and justice.
Aims
To promote interdisciplinary understanding of issues of international law and international justice;
To encourage understanding of the interaction between politics and law in the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity;
To understand the interaction between peace, and sustainable reconciliation in divided societies;
To foster conscious critical reading and discussion of issues of peace and justice.

  Propaganda has been regarded as one of the key instruments of political practice since the beginning of the 20th century. Propaganda research played a crucial role in establishing the academic field of communication studies in the social sciences. After its heyday in the interwar and early post-cold war years, propaganda research has recently regained the attention of scholar investigating the nexus between information and warfare. This course traces the development of propaganda research over the last century up to the present day. The aim is to discover continuities and ruptures in order to conceptualise information strategies against the background of current conflicts and security issues.

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security. It is also available as an option for students on other MA programmes. The module investigates the impact of nuclear and biological weapons on international security. In order to do so, we first gain a knowledge of key concepts and theories in International Relations and Security Studies.
We then turn to the science and technology involved in these weapons. Given that acquiring fissile material is the biggest technical challenge faced by proliferators, managing the fuel cycle is key to preventing proliferation&mdash;and so it is there that we will begin. Following that, we will then look at the science of nuclear warheads, focusing on the main developments in warhead technology since the 1940s. The effects of these weapons will also be discussed and contrasted with those from radiological devices which a more likely target for non-state actors. With the potential to cause mass deaths at low cost, biological weapons have been called the 'poor man's nuclear weapon'. Emphasis will be placed on what recent developments in the biosciences, the advent and proliferation of genetic engineering techniques in particular, mean for preventing the proliferation of biological weapons. We then examine the means of delivering nuclear and biological warheads by focusing on the technology underpinning ballistic and cruise missiles and contrasting these methods with other systems.
Drawing on these two bodies of knowledge, we then use deterrence theory to analyses the impact of nuclear and biological weapons on state security. This is followed by an analysis of the political and technological challenges of attributing an attack with nuclear or biological weapons. We also investigate the threat posed by these weapons in the hands of non-state actors. Finally we conclude with an examination of two important current issues the scientific and political feasibility of 'new' nuclear weapons and the possibility of developing robust systems for verifying nuclear disarmament.
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
Familiarize students with the basic science underlying key nuclear and biological weapons and their delivery systems
Develop a systematic understand of the key concepts and theories from the fields of international relations and security studies, especially as they relate to the analysis of nuclear and biological weapons
Provide a framework for the original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific and technical issues and developments in international security
Foster the capacity of critical analysis, independent judgement and communication at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study

Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will have:
A basic understanding of the science underlying nuclear and biological weapons
An understanding of the relevance of the science to key policy problems

  Aims:
This module seeks to develop a broad understanding of security issues that have emerged in the former Soviet Union (FSU) since 1992. It will consider the ways that the security environment changed for these states during the 1990s, and how it has continued to develop in the twenty-first century. In so doing, the module will examine traditional security concerns as well as new threats that have arisen in the regions of the FSU. The module will approach the concept of security from a perspective wider than that of military policy, to include crime, ecological issues as well as traditional doctrinal thinking and military developments.
  
Learning outcomes:
By the end of this module, students should:
have a critical understanding of the main trends in the security politics of the FSU, the development of these trends from the early 1990s into the twenty-first century, and the impact of the Soviet legacy and Russian regional power on them;
be aware of the main security challenges to and from the different regions of the FSU;
be able to demonstrate critical engagement with the academic literature on post-Soviet security.
  
To achieve this, the module is divided into four sections:
The Soviet approach to security and security structures. This provides the historical and political background for thinking about security issues in the FSU.
Post-Soviet Russian security policy, structures, assumptions and challenges, including security relations with other states, and the wars in Chechnya.
Security in the other post-Soviet states. This section will consider each region of the former Soviet Union in particular, highlighting security issues common to these regions and the security policy responses of the new states.
Security issues common to the post-Soviet space, including non-traditional security threats and the main security challenges for the future.

    The Civil War In The US 1861-1865 - Optional

    
  
      
     Module code:  
7SSWM014    
  
    Credit level:  
7  
    
  
  
      
   
    
  
       
    
     
  This  module   explains the military history of the Civil War and places it in the evolution of modern warfare, as many of its central features prefigure the Two World Wars of this century. We will assess the impact of industrialisation on war, the rise in the strength of the tactical defensive, and the impact of the railways and the telegraph on strategy. A very important theme is the way that military operations were shaped by the American political system and constitutional arrangements. Students cannot understand the war adequately unless they gain an understanding of how the American Constitution works. Elections continued regardless throughout the war and thus 'the war' itself became a major political 'issue', especially in 1864. Consequently, the respective contributions to the war effort of the executive branch and Congress will be a major concern, especially the dramatic increase in the power of the executive. Contrasts with the Confederacy will be examined.

Aims: The aim of this  module is to evaluate the military conduct of the American Civil War within its general context, by relating war on the battlefield to the political and social forces that directed it. This approach is an important one because far too much Civil War history has been antiquarian in tone and context, and far too concerned with piling up detail for its own sake. A narrowly focused approach to campaign history detailing every tactical move on the battlefield irrespective of its significance while simultaneously ignoring the political and social factors that determine the conduct of war is termed 'drum and trumpet' history. Much Civil War history has taken this form, especially during the Centennial years of 1961-65. This  module   will not consist of 'drum and trumpet' history. Moreover, students will not be required to master masses of minor tactical detail that explains the course of particular battles. General issues about the war's conduct will be our main concern. Given the focus on broad themes that rest on an understanding of military operations, students should be able to demonstrate both breadth and depth of knowledge.
Objectives:
Upon successful completing the course, students will have gained an understanding of:
Why the war broke out and how political issues influenced the Civil War's conduct;
The nature of strategy and its relationship with tactics and operations;
The degree to which the Civil War was a 'modern war';
The role and character of Civil War generalship and the pressures exerted on individual commanders in a democracy.
Upon successfully completing the course, students should be in a position to:
To navigate their way around a subject which has generated a vast (although enjoyable) literature that needs to be approached with discernment
To grasp and analyse the significance of bias or special pleading in the presentation of an historical case.

  Aims:
The aim of this module will be to provide students with an understanding of contemporary military operations, in the light of economic, social, technological and political changes affecting the environment in which these operations take place. Conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa will be covered. The module will build on issues raised in the MA core and provide an opportunity for those students who wish to develop further their interest in contemporary strategic issues. Recent events - including the 'war on terror' - provide the backdrop to this module, and there is flexibility to adjust to any further developments. It is important, however, to provide perspective and to consider other types of military operation. The weekly sessions will provide the historical and analytical context for the current debates.
  
Learning outcomes:
Upon successfully completing this module, students will be reasonably familiar with:
Contemporary debates on the changing character of armed conflict, and in particular the importance of resources and identity;
The shift from interstate wars to "wars among the people";
A number of recent conflicts and their inter-connectedness;
The history and uses of terrorism;
The nature of the international jihadi groups and the world from which they spring;
The changing technology of warfare and the impact of the 'information age';
Questions of legitimacy and the role of the media and international law;

  This module considers the conceptual difficulties involved with the term &lsquo;imperialism&rsquo; in understanding current and past global conflict. Taking an historical perspective on the evolution of western European empires, it challenges many current definitions. Though the British Empire necessarily looms large, the module takes a comparative approach to western empires since the fifteenth century, examining the changing motivation, method, and perceived purpose of expansion. In this way, it will assess, in particular, the role of coercion and of military asymmetry in global history to the present day.

  Israel's presence in the "occupied territories" has now persisted for over forty years, during which time the number of Jewish settlers in these lands has grown dramatically and Israeli control over the territories has been strengthened by the use of checkpoints, bypass roads, military operations and, most recently, the construction of a "security fence". Palestinians perceive themselves to be a society under occupation. There are different views about the causes of this occupation, and even about whether "occupation" is an appropriate word to describe the situation in these areas. This module looks at the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from 1967 to present as a case of Military Occupation.
It analyses the methods used by Israelis and Palestinians in their struggle to control these disputed lands.
Learning outcomes:
Having successfully completed the module, students will have gained an ability to demonstrate:
An understanding of the term "military occupation".A familiarity with a variety of sources on military occupation.
A comprehensive understanding of the main turning points, themes and issues related to the Israeli occupation from 1967 to present.
An understanding of the ways the Military Government and the Civil Administration function.
An understanding of how the building of Jewish settlements affects the Palestinians and the resources, particularly, water and land.
