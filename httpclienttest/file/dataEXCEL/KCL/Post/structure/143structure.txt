   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  The course is delivered through lectures, small group seminars, skills development groups, case presentations and personal and professional development groups. This course includes a significant amount of live supervised clinical practice which enables students to develop their psychotherapy skills to a high level and with a range of clients. Students on the PT MSc will need to be working in a context that allows them to complete 100 clinical hours of family and couple therapy in each year of the course. 
Study groups are small and there is a high level of personal attention. Lectures and discussions form the core teaching for each module. They cover the main topics and key themes in the curriculum of each module, and ideas are developed further in small group work, case analyses and student presentations. You are expected to supplement class work and lecture notes with further reading. Students find it helpful to do some preparatory reading each week. 
As well as recommended references, which are linked to each weeks sessions, independent literature searches will extend your knowledge and understanding and increase your chances of success. During the first term there will be a library induction and a workshop on literature searching. Because much of the learning and teaching takes place in groups of no more than twenty students, sessions are typically interactive and student contributions are encouraged. 
All students have a personal and academic tutor who will arrange appointments at least once a term. They are available at other times if you require more support. Assessment is through written assignments, examination, clinical presentation and ongoing formative assessment of practice. A key component of the programme assessment is designing, executing and writing-up a small scale research project which is submitted by the end of the first year (FT) or second year (PT). You will be assigned a dissertation supervisor. The exact amount of supervision time will vary between students but we would recommend a total contact time of between  six and  ten hours.
