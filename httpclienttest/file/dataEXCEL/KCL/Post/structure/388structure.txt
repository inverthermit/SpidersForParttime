   Indicative non-core content
   Optional modules (20&minus;40 credits):Students must take 20 credits of optional modules from any Level 7 (Masters) modules offered in the Geography Department. Students who wish to take greater than 180 credits overall (for a maximum total of 200 credits) will require approval from the Programme Director using the Module Amendment Form available from https://internal.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/stu/geog/student-forms.aspx
. However, it is not necessary to take these additional credits and it is strongly advised that students generally restrict themselves to the minimum number of credits required.
Other Optional Modules Available to Students on this Programme:
Any Level 7 (Masters) modules offered in the Geography Department, including from the list of prescribed optional modules given above.
Up to 20 credits of Level 7 modules from any KCL Departments or Institutes outside of Geography.&dagger;
&dagger; Students may take up to 20 credits of their programme&rsquo;s optional modules, in departments or institutes outside of the Geography Department (i.e., non-7SSG modules). Approval will be subject to justification to and written approval of their Programme Director using the Permission to take modules in other KCL Departments/Institutes form (see https://internal.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/stu/geog/student-forms.aspx)
 and subject to availability and signed permission from the appropriate department/institute administrator (in the exterior department/institute) to allow them on the module.

     
   
   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Specialist taught modules assessed by essay, presentation, lab work and occasionally by examination. The three-month dissertation is compulsory and can be taken overseas or in the UK.

  On completion of the module, students will be able to demonstrate substantive knowledge and critical appreciation of:
The functioning of freshwater, estuarine and coastal systems, and of the management and sustainable exploitation of their resources
The current and emerging issues and priorities in freshwater and estuarine management. Such issues include, inter alia, the implications of climate change; the development of approaches to water resource exploitation that balance human and environmental needs; the scientific underpinning of methods for management, enhancement and restoration; the development and monitoring of targets for ecosystem integrity; the interface between scientific tools for environmental management / assessment and their application in decision and policy making.
Contemporary and controversial issues in water management is informed and enhanced by external experts and practitioners, who either contribute directly as external lecturers or with whom regular liaison is maintained, and by student visits to agencies and enterprises involved in water management or exploitation.

  This module aims to provide a background in issues and methods involved in doing environmental research, including research methods and design. To achieve this, the module consists of a series of lectures, seminars, and practicals giving an overview of methods in designing, analyzing, presenting and evaluating environmental research. A subcomponent of this module will be an additional unassessed but required set of practicals and seminars giving a overview of laboratory and field equipment available in the KCL Department of Geography. On completion of this module, the student will be able to define the features of environmental problems and will be able to assess environmental investigations in terms of their design strategies for collection of data, data analysis, and results presentation. When taken with SG/5111 the students will be fully equipped to carry out their own independent research into environmental problems using these methodologies.

  This module enables students to derive a greater understanding of the relationship between methodology and method and the related notions of epistemology and ontology. The module is a mix of lectures and tutorials and enables students to develop skills in the appropriate use and application of quantitative and qualitative methods, which will have been worked through in tutorial sessions. The module lays the conceptual groundwork for the design of the dissertation and enables students to appreciate the connections between epistemology and the students particular programme of study.

  This module aims to provide the key knowledge and understanding necessary to support the development of management strategies for rivers. It therefore embraces three complementary topics: the dimensions of catchment and river system processes, particularly the connectivity between catchment, river and their floodplain processes and the interdependency of hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes; the ways in which human activities at a range of spatial and temporal scales impact on the fluvial system and how these impacts propagate through the catchment, river system and floodplain; the options available for environmentally-sensitive management of rivers, their catchments and floodplains.

  This module provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the recent history of water resource allocation and management especially in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Priority will be given to outlining a conceptual framework identifying the relevant underlying ecological, economic and sociological principles relevant in the evaluation and management of water resources. The conceptual framework will also show the link between these underlying principles and environmental and economic policies. The roles of the institutions and technologies through which such policies can be implemented will also be analysed and exemplified.
