  This module covers three major areas:
The pharmacology part of the module will include basic principles, plus the use of animal models, including transgenic models. You will see how the pharmacology studies inform the choice of drug candidates.
You will learn of the importance of preclinical safety testing, including what tests are needed to start and progress a clinical development programme. You will learn how to look for critical information within a toxicology report and will visit a major toxicology laboratory. 
The module will also introduce aspects of pharmaceutical sciences, including the choice of formulation, stability testing, scale-up and how these issues can impact on a clinical trial programme.

In addition to reviewing the general principles of medical ethics and how they apply to clinical research as defined within the various guidelines and statutes we will have presentations from patient groups and a member of an ethics committee. The issues around business ethics and marketing will also be explored.
We will look at the mechanisms of cellular toxicology, the value of spontaneous reporting and the use of large electronic data bases as means of evaluating the safety of medicines. We will look at safety issues from the point of view of the sponsor, the investigator and the regulator and learn how to develop and implement a risk management plan.
