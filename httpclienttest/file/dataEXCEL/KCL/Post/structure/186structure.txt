  The module provides a thorough grounding in the conceptual, historical and contextual themes in the study of intelligence including its development and role within the domains of international security. A particular emphasis will be placed on the way that issues of intelligence permeate general themes of warfare and international relations. While attention will be given to intelligence methods, structures, institutions and processes, the course will not analyse intelligence merely as a discrete information gathering exercise but seeks to place the phenomenon in its widest setting by providing a framework to understand key ideas and dilemmas in international security.
  

Aims:
The aims of this module are to provide:
A conceptual framework in which to understand the nature and role of intelligence in its relationship to wider issues in war and international security.
An understanding of the processes, practices and institutions that have characterised intelligence in the modern era.
An understanding of intelligence collection, assessment and reporting processes and their ability or not to predict events in world affairs.
An appreciation of the particular dilemmas generated by intelligence related phenomena

Learning outcomes:
  
On completion of the module students will demonstrate:
A thorough comprehension of the methodological issues associated with the definition and study of intelligence.
A clear comprehension of the definitional, practical and moral issues affecting intelligence activities in both their information gathering guise and their wider relationship to issues of international security.
An awareness of the ways in which intelligence issues manifest themselves in security issues in peace and war.
An understanding of the kinds of problems and ethical dilemmas associated with intelligence activity.
An overall appreciation of the demanding challenges and debates confronting issues of intelligence in both historical and contemporary settings to be shown through the ability to critically engage with the literature on the subject.

  The role of open source intelligence (OSINT) has assumed increasing prominence in intelligence communities since the end of the Cold War, largely as a result of the prolific growth of OSINT sources as a result of the rapid spread of worldwide use of the Internet. This module will cover thoroughly both theoretical and practical aspects of OSINT, including OSINT collection, analysis and management methodologies. The latter will be addressed by the application of OSINT by students to study varied case studies in two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises.
This module will appeal most strongly to students taking the MA in Intelligence and International Security. However, it is anticipated that in line with the commitment of the Department of War Studies to the inter-disciplinary study of war, the module will appeal also to students on the whole range of existing MA programmes and contribute to their respective learning outcomes.
Aims:
This module aims to provide students with:
an understanding of the history, theory and use of OSINT;
a critical understanding of the difference between collection and analysis of OSINT;
specialised knowledge of the methods of collection and analysis of OSINT;
a framework for applying these methods to two key security issues: nuclear non-proliferation and humanitarian crises;
practical experience of the application of these methods in both individual and group contexts;
and an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of these methods.

Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to carry out the following:
plan and organise substantial OSINT projects;
conduct highly advanced internet research, including the identification of rich sources of information, and the evaluation of the reliability and utility of sources;
synthesise information from a range of sources, using the full variety of source formats (including hard copy and verbal communications in addition to online sources);
perform a number of methods and modes of analysis;
select these methods for use according to their suitability for collected sources;
and to assess critically the theoretical rigour of their OSINT work.

      Just as the best test of a student&rsquo;s grasp of academic scholarship is to ask the student to make his or her own small contribution in the form of an essay or dissertation, so the best test of your understanding of the salient features of conflict simulation is to ask you to design a small simulation of your own. Hence, your mark for this course depends entirely on your individual simulation project, the final version of which must be handed in by noon on Monday May 2nd (the start of the 3rd term). The project must meet the specification in all respects if it is to be accepted for assessment.
     
  All prospective students should be sure to consult this site and the associated websites for Professor Sabin&rsquo;s two latest books, to ensure that you understand what this unusual and innovative course involves.

 or just Google &lsquo;Sabin consim&rsquo;.
You should also consult http://www.professionalwargaming.co.uk/
 for more on Professor Sabin&acute;s role in promoting and assisting with the use of conflict simulation by military forces and defence analysts in the UK and overseas. You must be aware up front that the course is a lot of work and can take significantly more time than other courses, though past students have found it commensurately engaging and rewarding.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVESThis option course builds on a corpus of material hitherto almost entirely neglected within War Studies curricula, namely the several thousand conflict simulation board games published in recent decades which attempt to model the dynamics of past or potential campaigns. The aims of the course are as follows:
to familiarise students with the various possible mechanisms of conflict simulation, and the strengths and weaknesses of each;
to allow students to create their own original simulation of a particular historical campaign or battle of their choice;
to use simulation and modelling to encourage students to analyse the key dynamics of conflict situations, thereby gaining greater insight into the physical and human determinants of conflict;
to help develop a wide range of skills, including critical appraisal of existing simulations, detailed historical research into a specific campaign, intellectual creativity in devising and testing simulation models, legalistic clarity and precision in drafting simulation rules, and design skills in producing simulation graphics;
to allow students to practise broader transferable skills, in particular team work in a variety of contexts, familiarity with handling computer graphics, and the use of the internet to find information, disseminate ideas and receive feedback from the wider simulation community.

  British Defence Policy has been going through an unprecedented period of operational challenge in the last few years and particularly in the last half dozen years. Until the launch of the previous Government's Defence Review in September 2009 there had been very little discussion of the direction and shape of British defence policy outside of the Ministry of Defence and the armed services. Decisions with enormous implications for future generations have been taken with little or no public engagement with the debates. As casualties have risen in Iraq and Afghanistan a campaign to draw attention to the pay and conditions of service personnel and their families has re-opened a debate on the concept of a military covenant between the state and the armed forces which continues. At the same time defence policy has begun to be seen as a component of a broader National Security Strategy with significant implications for future funding models and modes of delivery.
  
While the current preoccupation is on on-going operational commitments in the Middle East and Central Asia, significant problems in equipment procurement continue to dog the British defence establishment with claims of enormous gaps in the defence budget provision for existing equipment programmes and future requirements. The Government has embarked upon a 'strategic defence and security review' which is due to report in he autumn of 2010. This module will consider these and other issues in the historical context of British defence policy and in light of current debates.
  
Aims:
This aims of the  module are to:
- provide a framework for understanding and analysing the formulation and delivery of defence policy in the UK;
- foster the skills required for analysis of the various influences on defence policy formulation;
- develop a comprehensive appreciation of the relationship between government, the military and commercial organisations in the delivery of defence capability;
- highlight how commercial calculations affects political decisions and public discourse; and,
- promote an understanding of the impact of new technology on the future of British defence policy.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:
On successfully completing the module students will be able to demonstrate:
- an understanding of the key issues facing current British defence policy makers;
- a critical engagement in the methodological questions associated with the study of defence policy making;
- an understanding of the historical context of existing defence policy;
- the ability to evaluate the conflicting pressures on the armed services; and,
- an ability to engage critically with the literature on the subject, to undertake independent research and to exercise informed judgement on current security issues.

  
    Current Issues In Science   Security - Optional

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security and is also available as an options module to students on other MA programmes in the Department. The purpose of the module is to examine a variety of issues in international politics where scientific and technological issues intersect with security concerns. We focus on three broad topics: missile defense and the prospect of an arms race in space; the environment as a security threat, and the verification of arms control and disarmament agreements. For each of these topics, we gain an understanding of the science involved, examine relevant social science theories and concepts, and then use these tools to anlayse the policy issues involved, with a focus on the interaction of science and politics.
Aims:
The aims of the module are to:
- familiarise students with the basic science underlying important contemporary issues in international politics
- develop a systematic understanding of the relevant concepts and theories from Security Studies, and encourage a critical awareness of the theoretical and empirical debates surrounding them
- promote the capacity for critical evaluation, independent judgment and communication at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study
- foster the skills required for critical analysis of the implications of scientific and technological developments on security
- provide a framework for original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific developments in shaping security problems

Learning outcomes:

By the end of the module, students will have:
- a basic understanding of the science underlying contemporary issues in international politics
- the ability to analyse critically technical claims made in the field of international security
- an ability to provide politically-informed technical analysis in the field of science and security
- critically engaged with key concepts and theories used in security studies, and applied those concepts and theories to an analysis of current and historical security issues
- carried out original, critical analysis of the impact of scientific and technological developments on security, using knowledge of the science involved and tools drawn from IR theory and security studies
- practised a range of intellectual, practical and transferable skills, through participation in classes and through the preparation and submission of course work

  The detailed substance of the course will focus inter alia on topics such as the following: diplomacy and intelligence; military diplomacy; summitry; mediation; the role of diplomacy in multilateral forums. Students will be encouraged to make use of case studies to illustrate general propositions about diplomatic theory and practice.

Aims:
This module will examine the theory, art and practice of diplomacy, both as an instrument of foreign policy and an institution in the international system.
It will analyse the way in which diplomacy, unlike most other aspects of international life, emphasises that which states have in common as well as those things which divide them.
It will study diplomacy from the perspectives of politics, international law and history.
In addition to this, it will look at the roles and functions of diplomacy regarding states and their policies, as well as the conduct of diplomacy in different forums and in different collective activities.

Learning Outcomes:
At the end of the module, students should have:
An understanding of topics such as the following: diplomacy and intelligence; coercive diplomacy; summitry; mediation; the role of diplomacy in multilateral forums; diplomacy in the post Cold War and Post 9/11 worlds;
Made use of case studies to illustrate general propositions about diplomatic theory and practice;
A clearer understanding of the role of diplomacy as an institution in international society, its civilising influence and the extent to which its norms and conventions can be regarded as appropriate and effective in an age of globalisation, and new security threats.


  
    East Asian Security - Optional

  The module provides an introduction to the study of East Asian security in the contemporary world. East Asia stands out as one of the world's most dynamic regions and the module analyses how competing schools of thought identify in different political, strategic, socio-cultural and economic factors the keys to decipher the evolving nature of regional architecture and power structure.
The module focuses primarily on the area of the Eurasian continent including countries historically influenced by the Chinese civilisation, China, Japan, the two Koreas, and Taiwan. It reviews cultural assumptions and historical circumstances that shaped the security of the region in the Cold War and beyond. It investigates liberal, realist and constructivist theories of regional security and test them against issues of critical significance for regional stability such as the role of the American alliance system in the post 9/11 era, the power competition between the United States and China, and the questions of legacy and memories of World War II. Further, the module explores the influence of actors such as India, ASEAN and the European Union on regional order and power balance.
Aims:
This module aims to:
Provide students with an historical and geopolitical understanding of the different notions of East Asia;
Introduce students to the existing literature and perspectives on East Asian security;
Enhance students' ability to assess the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to regional security;
Foster the understanding and application of a range of intellectual and study skills, including critical analysis, independent judgment, as well as oral and written presentational skills and time management.

Learning outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:
Have a comprehensive understanding of the different approaches to the study of East Asian security;
Evaluate and debate theories and interpretations of East Asian security through critical and analytical analysis;
Place issues and problems concerning security in East Asia within the context of wider debates on international security affairs;
Have a substantial knowledge of the methodological issues concerning research on East Asian security;
Undertake original and independent research on questions related to international relation theories and security in East Asia.

  
    Ethics In International Relations - Optional

    Semester 1 (autumn)     
   
    
  
      Assessment:  
      coursework     
      Assessment will be by means of two written submissions. The first will consist of a 1500 word book review (or similar exercise) which will contribute 20% to the final mark for the module as a whole. The second will be an essay of 4000 words which will contribute the remaining 80% of the mark for the module as a whole. The pass mark for both pieces of work is set at 50%.
     
  This is a research based option which flows from the work conducted by Professor Frost in the field of Ethics in International Relations. The impetus for this research came from the neglect which the discipline of IR has traditionally shown towards issues to do with ethics in world politics. The central claim developed and defended in this option is that no coherent understanding of contemporary international affairs is possible without a serious and sustained engagement with a core set of ethical issues. Such engagement with ethical thought and argument is required for us to make sense of any of the following actions: actions in defence of state sovereignty, wars of national liberation, new wars, secession, humanitarian interventions, the global war against terror, international crime, international aid, development aid, and national self-determination. In recent years IR scholars have gradually paid more attention to the link between ethics and explanation in world politics. This module will introduce students to some of the key debates which have emerged in the burgeoning field of contemporary normative international relations theory.
Course Aims and ObjectivesThis module will engage students in a research based programme built around the core text written by the convenor entitled Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom and International Relations (Routledge, 2008), but will also refer to his other books, Constituting Human Rights (Routledge, 2002), Ethics in International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1996) and Towards a Normative Theory of International Relations (Cambridge University Press, 1986). It also aims to engage students with the articles reprinted in Mervyn Frost (ed), International Ethics (Volumes 1- 4) (London, Sage Library of International Relations, 2011)
It will immerse students in an in-depth, historically informed study of the place of ethics in the discipline of International Relations paying particular attention to the reasons for its neglect in main stream International Relations theory as it developed in the 20th century
This option will acquaint students with the traditional literature that did take ethical issues in international affairs seriously prior to the advent of modern social scientific method in the discipline. They will consider why this body of literature was submerged by the rise of positivist social scientific approaches to IR.
It will explore the ways in which ethical matters impinge on the study of world affairs in spite of the sustained attempts by scholars to make a sharp distinction between facts and values in order to sustain the claim the IR is a scientific discipline.
It will discuss the social scientific difficulties we encounter when studying human actions (which is the material studied by IR theorists) and how these difficulties inevitably lead social scientist to engage with profound ethical issues.
Students will be lead to discover the salience of the above for our understanding and explanation of all key policy areas in international affairs from trade policy to war making.
A key aim is to teach students how to move beyond merely pointing out the salience of ethical considerations to what they do as IR scholars, to actually engaging in argument to move towards a solution of some of the pressing ethical issues of our time in the international sphere. They will be required usefully to engage with questions to do with sovereignty, just war theory, normative theories about new wars, the ethical issues produced by the global &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;, global governance, democratization, the advancement of freedom by global civil society, human rights in a world of states, and others.
Students will be invited to discuss a range of core texts by contemporary political philosophers working in this area including the work of John Rawls, Michael Walzer, Terry Nardin, Charles Beitz, Mervyn Frost, Chris Brown and others.

  The  module aims to introduce a range of analytical approaches to the study of security in Europe today and develop a detailed knowledge and understanding of the main issues and developments since the end of the Cold War. It focuses on the response of states and international organisations to the new security challenges and considers the nature of the emerging security order. It analyses the ways in which NATO, the EU and the OSCE have adapted to the post Cold War and post 9/11 security environment, the relationship between them and their respective roles in providing security. The role of the US in Europe and the debate over the future of the transatlantic security partnership will be critically explored. National perspectives on European security issues are also considered through the comparative study of the defence policies of France, Germany, the UK, Russia and a selection of other European states. The  module concludes with a number of case-studies on specific issues and regions in order to bring together both the conceptual and empirical themes of the course.

  Human Rights and Migration adopts a socio-legal approach to questions relating migration and human rights. In doing do, it stresses the significance of political context in the construction of legal frameworks dealing with the politically charged question of the movement of peoples across national boundaries and examines these in relation to the agencies and institutions of the European Union. Each session considers the theoretical issue relating to human rights and migration, how the question is dealt with in international treaties, and what the implications are for migrants.
  
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
To promote in students an advanced understanding of the relationship between human rights law and the movement of people across national boundaries.  The focus throughout will be on the interrelationships both supportive and conflictual between the domestic law within states dealing with migration, EU law and International Law.

  The module explores the emergence and evolution of the Middle East system of states and its international politics since 1945, through a framework of analysis that is partly historical and partly thematic. The module is heavily based on reading seminars through which the themes discussed in lectures are explored, often in relation to current case studies. You will be expected to read an average of 140-150 pages a week. The lectures start with a survey of the emergence of the modern Middle East since the late Ottoman period, through the era of British and French imperialism, to the post-1945 independence period and the Cold War and post-Cold War eras. This is intended to demonstrate the importance of the international system in shaping the modern states and political patterns of the region, and also to reveal the importance of social structures and political economy in additionally determining inter-state behaviour. This perspective is applied to the rise of nationalism, impact of oil, and pressures to liberalize economically and politically, especially since the end of the Cold War. Sweeping social and economic transformation has moreover led to the rise of new forms of 'identity politics' that are explored in the cases of religious-nationalist Zioism and of political Islam, and to the increasing role of armed non-state actors. These themes are developed through extensive discussion of select case-studies including Iraq, Iran, and Israel and the Palestinians. The primary aim is to provide a basic ability to analyze and understand major political issues and historical processes in the Middle East. The secondary aim is to provide training in the critical reading of assigned texts and their use in analytical writing.
Aims
The aims of the module are to:
enhance student knowledge of the determinants of modern Middle East politics and state formation;
provide an analytical framework for understanding the Arab-Israeli and Gulf conflicts, intra-regional relations, the politics of oil, and the Middle East policies of the super/global powers;
allow students to develop their understanding of the role of identity politics (nationalism and religion) in inter-state politics in the region;
allow students to develop their understanding of the politics of economic and political liberalization in the Middle East in the context of globalization;
encourage critical engagement with debates about the applicability and utility of different International Relations theoretical approaches in explaining the international politics of the Middle East.
  
Learning outcomes
At the end of the module, students will be able to:
interpret and explain events in the Middle East through application of universal analytical concepts and methods;
assess critically the impact of global processes on Middle East politics, and equally to draw on the example of the Middle East to re-evaluate the international politics of other regions of the world;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the levels-of-analysis approach, questions of causality, and critical comparative perspective in International Relations thinking, including the interplay of external and internal factors in the national, regional, and international politics of states;
explain the relevance of social origins, historical context, and political economy of states to their foreign policy behaviour, affecting the nature, extent, and pace of regionalism, economic and political liberalization, and globalization;
demonstrate a critical understanding of the role of ideology and culture in international politics;
communicate effectively about these issues verbally and in writing;display research skills pertinent to the study of international politics of the Middle East.

  The public's 'right to know' and the government's need for secrecy in its military and counter-terrorism operations characterise the core problem in the relationship between governments and media in liberal democracies. This module explores an even more tenuous relationship by focusing on the tensions as well as interdependencies between the intelligence and the journalistic communities. It explores the role media products play as an 'open source' in the intelligence cycle, how intelligence services 'use' the media to influence public perceptions and, finally, how journalists report &ndash; or fail to report &ndash; the activities of intelligence services. It will also critically reflect on the impact of New Media on the intelligence community and how it is represented in mainstream media and popular culture.
Aims:

- a critical engagement with the political and ethical dimensions of the media on the one hand and intelligence services on the other
- an appreciation of the institutional developments of open source intelligence gathering and its role in the intelligence cycle
- a framework for understanding and analysing the impact of information operations on the media in times of war
- a critical appreciation of the relationship between government, the intelligence community and the media

  Aims
The aim of the module is to discuss all the ramifications of natural resource conflicts in developing societies and to situate these within the nexus of security and development. The  module is conceived against the increasing importance of natural resources in developing societies and the implications of the attendant conflicts to global peace. The module defines natural resources as all non-artificial products situated on or beneath the soil or rivers, which can be extracted, harvested or used and whose extraction, harvest or usage generate income or serve other functional purposes in benefiting mankind. The conflicts covered under the course include those between and within nations. Among others, the module focuses on the causes and nature of resource conflicts, their connection with local and global governance, the clash between local claims and national interest in resource politics, the link between international demand and pressures on local communities, the activities of warlords, the involvement of the international community in addressing these conflicts and the impact of globalisation on resource conflicts. The module also discusses all the contending debates on natural-resource conflicts and takes examples from across the world to illuminate the different manifestations and complexities of these conflicts. 
  
Learning outcomes:
At the end of the module, it is expected that students will be in a position to understand:
the academic issues surrounding natural resource conflicts, especially the local and international issues that determine their causes and manifestations;
the policy issues raised by these conflicts, especially the efforts by the international community like the Kimberley Process;
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and a host of others; andhow natural resource conflicts have stunted development and affected security in developing societies
  
  
Outline:
(a) Contextualising "Natural resources" and "Conflict"
(b) The conflicts over land

  Over the course of the past decade or so, a number of developments seemed to point to an increasing trend toward using judicial mechanisms to deal with post-conflict and transitional justice. The establishment of ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994, the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 1998, the inauguration of alternative forms of 'internationalized' justice in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Bosnia an Herzegovina, Kosovo and Cambodia and the apparent tendency toward the increased exercise of universal jurisdiction by national courts - all represented different approaches to prosecuting war crimes. Meanwhile, other processes have been tried with varying degrees of success, such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa and other combinations of truth commission and amnesty in parts of Latin America and Africa. It has also become evident that justice in a post-conflict society cannot be achieved if not pursued through rule of law and independent judiciary. 
This module examines all of these developments within a framework combining aspects of international law with aspects of international relations, and focusing on the merits and disadvantages of a range of approaches and the relationship between peace and justice.
Aims
To promote interdisciplinary understanding of issues of international law and international justice;
To encourage understanding of the interaction between politics and law in the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity;
To understand the interaction between peace, and sustainable reconciliation in divided societies;
To foster conscious critical reading and discussion of issues of peace and justice.

  This module is one of the compulsory elements in the MA in Science and Security. It is also available as an option for students on other MA programmes. The module investigates the impact of nuclear and biological weapons on international security. In order to do so, we first gain a knowledge of key concepts and theories in International Relations and Security Studies.
We then turn to the science and technology involved in these weapons. Given that acquiring fissile material is the biggest technical challenge faced by proliferators, managing the fuel cycle is key to preventing proliferation&mdash;and so it is there that we will begin. Following that, we will then look at the science of nuclear warheads, focusing on the main developments in warhead technology since the 1940s. The effects of these weapons will also be discussed and contrasted with those from radiological devices which a more likely target for non-state actors. With the potential to cause mass deaths at low cost, biological weapons have been called the 'poor man's nuclear weapon'. Emphasis will be placed on what recent developments in the biosciences, the advent and proliferation of genetic engineering techniques in particular, mean for preventing the proliferation of biological weapons. We then examine the means of delivering nuclear and biological warheads by focusing on the technology underpinning ballistic and cruise missiles and contrasting these methods with other systems.
Drawing on these two bodies of knowledge, we then use deterrence theory to analyses the impact of nuclear and biological weapons on state security. This is followed by an analysis of the political and technological challenges of attributing an attack with nuclear or biological weapons. We also investigate the threat posed by these weapons in the hands of non-state actors. Finally we conclude with an examination of two important current issues the scientific and political feasibility of 'new' nuclear weapons and the possibility of developing robust systems for verifying nuclear disarmament.
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
Familiarize students with the basic science underlying key nuclear and biological weapons and their delivery systems
Develop a systematic understand of the key concepts and theories from the fields of international relations and security studies, especially as they relate to the analysis of nuclear and biological weapons
Provide a framework for the original analysis of the historical and contemporary role of scientific and technical issues and developments in international security

  Aims:
This module seeks to develop a broad understanding of security issues that have emerged in the former Soviet Union (FSU) since 1992. It will consider the ways that the security environment changed for these states during the 1990s, and how it has continued to develop in the twenty-first century. In so doing, the module will examine traditional security concerns as well as new threats that have arisen in the regions of the FSU. The module will approach the concept of security from a perspective wider than that of military policy, to include crime, ecological issues as well as traditional doctrinal thinking and military developments.
  
Learning outcomes:
By the end of this module, students should:
have a critical understanding of the main trends in the security politics of the FSU, the development of these trends from the early 1990s into the twenty-first century, and the impact of the Soviet legacy and Russian regional power on them;
be aware of the main security challenges to and from the different regions of the FSU;
be able to demonstrate critical engagement with the academic literature on post-Soviet security.
  
To achieve this, the module is divided into four sections:
The Soviet approach to security and security structures. This provides the historical and political background for thinking about security issues in the FSU.
Post-Soviet Russian security policy, structures, assumptions and challenges, including security relations with other states, and the wars in Chechnya.
Security in the other post-Soviet states. This section will consider each region of the former Soviet Union in particular, highlighting security issues common to these regions and the security policy responses of the new states.
Security issues common to the post-Soviet space, including non-traditional security threats and the main security challenges for the future.


  
    The Civil War In The US 1861-1865 - Optional

  This  module   explains the military history of the Civil War and places it in the evolution of modern warfare, as many of its central features prefigure the Two World Wars of this century. We will assess the impact of industrialisation on war, the rise in the strength of the tactical defensive, and the impact of the railways and the telegraph on strategy. A very important theme is the way that military operations were shaped by the American political system and constitutional arrangements. Students cannot understand the war adequately unless they gain an understanding of how the American Constitution works. Elections continued regardless throughout the war and thus 'the war' itself became a major political 'issue', especially in 1864. Consequently, the respective contributions to the war effort of the executive branch and Congress will be a major concern, especially the dramatic increase in the power of the executive. Contrasts with the Confederacy will be examined.

Aims: The aim of this  module is to evaluate the military conduct of the American Civil War within its general context, by relating war on the battlefield to the political and social forces that directed it. This approach is an important one because far too much Civil War history has been antiquarian in tone and context, and far too concerned with piling up detail for its own sake. A narrowly focused approach to campaign history detailing every tactical move on the battlefield irrespective of its significance while simultaneously ignoring the political and social factors that determine the conduct of war is termed 'drum and trumpet' history. Much Civil War history has taken this form, especially during the Centennial years of 1961-65. This  module   will not consist of 'drum and trumpet' history. Moreover, students will not be required to master masses of minor tactical detail that explains the course of particular battles. General issues about the war's conduct will be our main concern. Given the focus on broad themes that rest on an understanding of military operations, students should be able to demonstrate both breadth and depth of knowledge.
Objectives:
Upon successful completing the course, students will have gained an understanding of:
Why the war broke out and how political issues influenced the Civil War's conduct;
The nature of strategy and its relationship with tactics and operations;
The degree to which the Civil War was a 'modern war';
The role and character of Civil War generalship and the pressures exerted on individual commanders in a democracy.
Upon successfully completing the course, students should be in a position to:
To navigate their way around a subject which has generated a vast (although enjoyable) literature that needs to be approached with discernment
To grasp and analyse the significance of bias or special pleading in the presentation of an historical case.

  
    The Conduct Of Contemporary Warfare - Optional

  Aims:
The aim of this module will be to provide students with an understanding of contemporary military operations, in the light of economic, social, technological and political changes affecting the environment in which these operations take place. Conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa will be covered. The module will build on issues raised in the MA core and provide an opportunity for those students who wish to develop further their interest in contemporary strategic issues. Recent events - including the 'war on terror' - provide the backdrop to this module, and there is flexibility to adjust to any further developments. It is important, however, to provide perspective and to consider other types of military operation. The weekly sessions will provide the historical and analytical context for the current debates.
  
Learning outcomes:
Upon successfully completing this module, students will be reasonably familiar with:
Contemporary debates on the changing character of armed conflict, and in particular the importance of resources and identity;
The shift from interstate wars to "wars among the people";
A number of recent conflicts and their inter-connectedness;
The history and uses of terrorism;
The nature of the international jihadi groups and the world from which they spring;
The changing technology of warfare and the impact of the 'information age';
Questions of legitimacy and the role of the media and international law;
The relevance of weapons of mass destruction;
Issues of casualty intolerance and asymmetry;
The problems of research into contemporary conflicts.

  Drawing upon a range of historical and contemporary case studies, this course is designed to give students an understanding of the origins and evolution of the modern British intelligence machinery. In tracing the developments of the various agencies that constitute British intelligence, the course will seek to explore the nature of British intelligence, which at the heart revolves around the workings of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC). In doing so it will focus on the disciplines of intelligence (signals intelligence, human intelligence, espionage etc), as well as its products. It will focus on the effects of intelligence gathering on decision making, particularly in the realm of national security and military policy. It will use a variety of case studies to explore and illustrate persistent issues related to the study of intelligence.

Aims:
This   module aims to provide:
A framework for understanding intelligence, what it is and how it works.
A critical appreciation of the intelligence cycle, and of the role of the JIC in particular.
A systematic investigation into how intelligence producers interact with intelligence consumers.
An examination, through the use of historical and contemporary case studies, into intelligence successes and failures.
An introduction to the origins and composition of a JIC assessment, through the use of practical investigation.
The environment for developing critical analysis, independent judgment, and oral and written presentation at a level commensurate with taught postgraduate study.

Learning Outcomes:
Upon completion of the  module students will be able to demonstrate:
An appreciation of the way in which intelligence plays a role in governmental affairs.
A critical engagement with the methodological issues associated with the study of intelligence, within the wider context of governmental decision-making.
A clear understanding of the sources used to study intelligence.
An in-depth knowledge of the role played by British intelligence in policy making.
An ability to engage critically with the literature on the subject, and to undertake primary, independent research.
A range of transferable skills, including the use of oral presentations, multimedia presentations, written work, and group work.

  This module will introduce students to the conditions and practices of U.S. foreign and security policy and is divided into three parts. After an introductory discussion of what constitutes foreign and security policy studies, we will first look at theories of international relations and how far they frame our analyses of US foreign and security policies. To obtain a short overview of the historical evolution of US foreign policy in the 'long' 20th century excerpts from some select 'classics' (George F. Kennan, William Appleman Williams, Paul Kennedy, Francis Fukuyama and Samuel Huntington) will be read and crucial phases in the history of US foreign policy analysed. In the second part of the module, the various determinants of foreign policy as well as its instruments will be address. Focusing on structure, function, and agency in the foreign policy process the following areas will be cover: 1) ideas, ideologies and traditions, 2) institutions, 3) actors, 4) instruments and 5) international system. The last part of the module will be devoted to analysing various case studies both showcasing recent foreign policy issues and security dilemmas as well as the nexus between domestic and foreign policies. They express current fundamental transitions in the international world such as the changing security environment, the globalising economy and the growing number of transnational issues. Topics include 'rogue states' and non-proliferation, military intervention and nation-building, terrorism, globalisation and trade, energy and climate change, human rights and foreign assistance. Case studies have been selected so as to cover diverse issue areas while at the same time examining US foreign policy towards different regions in the world, among them Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
