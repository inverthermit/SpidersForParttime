  The compulsory core course is interdisciplinary in approach and takes advantage of the English department&rsquo;s central London location by considering various ways in which theorists, writers, and critics have thought about modernity through significant events in the modern history of the Capital. This enables seminar visits to various cultural institutions (such as the Museum of London and the Women&rsquo;s Library) and provides students with a unique perspective on the relationship between material culture, literature and urban history through this period.

  This course explores how conflict has been represented and remembered in 20th century war literature. It focuses on the First World War and Second World War (the Holocaust and Hiroshima included), but will also introduce literatures of the Cold War and Vietnam War; comparisons will be made to writing about the Iraq War; the course concludes with discussions of literary responses to 9/11. Alongside British writers, the course examines American writing and some European works in translation. It also comprises investigations of the relationship between literature, photography, film and digital media. The course encourages students to read both canonical and less well known literary works in conjunction with other discourses of conflict: psychoanalysis, gender and ideology. It investigates how these discourses both shape, and are in turn shaped by, discourses of war.

  This course will be concerned with urban literature from the mid-19th to the early 20th century. It will examine the ways in which writers have imagined the modern metropolis as a place of both disorder and opportunity: a labyrinthine city of Babylon, a moral and psychological challenge and the domain of new social and personal futures. It will move between European and American cities, asking how different cities have promoted distinctive ideas of urban modernity and noting the way writers, together with their associated cultural movements and conceptions of the city, have crossed national boundaries. The course is organised thematically &ndash; allowing us to highlight and explore some of the primary forms of urban modernity &ndash; and also chronologically, making it possible to think about the ways in which the culture of the metropolis has developed over time.

Marshall Berman, All That is Solid Melts into Air: the Experience of Modernity (London   New York: Verso, 1983)

  Modernity &ldquo;is cut off from the past and continually hurtling forward at such a dizzy pace that it cannot take root &hellip; it merely survives from one day to the next.&rdquo; (Octavio Paz)
This module reflects upon the ways in which technologies and theories of speed and acceleration have interacted with artistic form and style to create new aesthetic and political possibilities. It will use a diverse cross-period selection of texts, technologies, and media to explore the developments and transformations in our understanding of 'the new' since the 19th century.
Critical thinkers we will read include Henri Bergson, Walter Benjamin, Marshall Berman, Felipo Marinetti, Le Corbusier, Friedrich A Kittler, Paul Virilio, Bruno Latour and others. Rejecting the idea that speed or acceleration must necessarily be unidirectional, the module explores instead the unevenness of different &lsquo;modernities&rsquo; and asks challenging questions about subjectivity and situation.
This is not a period-based module and it moves between 19th, 20th and 21st centuries in a deliberate attempt to build up an archaeology of the challenges of technology to culture, style and ways of being in the world over a long period and in both Europe and America. Students interested in the contemporary will be equally as interested as students whose focus is the past.
This module aims to explore with students a theoretical debate which is still developing around the impacts of technology on our culture, our bodies and our ways of understanding ourselves and our relationship to our environment.

  This course investigates a number of the most significant topics in urban cultural production of the 20th century and into the 21st century. While broadly chronological, the course will not focus on the historical development of the city in the 20th century, rather on the complexities of modernity and its legacies, as seen in the cultural production of a range of global cities. To that end, the course will be led largely by a number of ideas which have been important for writers, artists and critics in conceptualising the urban world. Among the topics to be discussed are: global corporatism; urban identities; urban textualities; dystopias; the city as history; the shift from metropolis to &lsquo;postmetropolis&rsquo;, the &lsquo;mass&rsquo;, and forms of resistance. The emphasis throughout will be on the conceptual and aesthetic frameworks writers and artists use to provide distinct visions of the city, and we will focus on a range of media including fiction, journalism and critical essays, films and painting.
See indicative primary reading / viewing for a list of seminars. There will be a range of secondary material provided at the beginning of the semester. Some texts may change or be added according to current exhibitions, screenings, etc. which are available in London at the time.
