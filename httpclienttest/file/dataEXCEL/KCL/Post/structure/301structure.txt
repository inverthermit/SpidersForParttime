STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   Three core courses:
Great Transformations, Pseudo-Miracles and Arrested Development: Emerging Economies and Development Theory, Concepts and Strategies - this course introduces students to development theory, concepts and strategies emerging from: Classical political economy; Modernisation; Structuralism; Dependency theory; Neo-liberalism; the &lsquo;post-Washington Consensus&rsquo; and post-colonial/post-development theory
Markets, States and the Institutional Bases of Growth - the 2008 financial crisis has called into question the &ldquo;hegemonic&rdquo; belief in fully liberalized markets. This module examines state, markets and the bases of economic development and rapid growth.
The Political Economy of Market Reforms - this module invites students to think about how newly emerging economic powers have faced the challenge of passing difficult economic reforms? What affects the ability of policy makers to mobilize support? To overcome resistance? What explains the variations across cases of degrees of success as well as the differing patterns of success in some policy areas and failure or at best partial gains in others?
