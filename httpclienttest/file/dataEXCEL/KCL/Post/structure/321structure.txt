Aims:
The specific aims of the   module   are to:
Provide an internationally recognised qualification in war and psychiatry through an integrated, multi-disciplinary teaching approach.
Develop transferable skills and knowledge needed for a career in war studies and more specifically in military psychiatry, anti-terrorist activities and the emergency services.
Explore aspects of military psychiatry, such as screening for psychological vulnerability and the changing nature of post-combat syndromes, not necessarily addressed by clinical training.
Evaluate aspects of military psychiatry, such as morale and battlefield performance, which are relevant to the traditional study of the tactics and strategy of warfare.
Draw international comparisons between the UK experience, other European nations, the United States and Israel in a context of broadening NATO involvement and global military policing.
Discuss the social and cultural aspects of military psychiatry, which inform both an understanding of behaviour of service personnel and explanations of war-related psychiatric injury.
Foster amongst students a range of skills, including critical analysis, detailed research, intellectual creativity, clarity of expression and computer use.

an understanding, informed by historical and contemporary cases studies, of how civil wars start, spread, mutate and are brought to an end;
an understanding of how international organisations, international law, mediation and foreign intervention have influenced the course of civil wars;

  Human Rights and Migration adopts a socio-legal approach to questions relating migration and human rights. In doing do, it stresses the significance of political context in the construction of legal frameworks dealing with the politically charged question of the movement of peoples across national boundaries and examines these in relation to the agencies and institutions of the European Union. Each session considers the theoretical issue relating to human rights and migration, how the question is dealt with in international treaties, and what the implications are for migrants.
  
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
To promote in students an advanced understanding of the relationship between human rights law and the movement of people across national boundaries.  The focus throughout will be on the interrelationships both supportive and conflictual between the domestic law within states dealing with migration, EU law and International Law.
Unpack the international legal framework in relation to contemporary ethical ideas about individual identity, belonging and citizenship.  This will involve students moving beyond "black letter" law to a study of the ethical values which underpin it.
Set out the legal framework governing the refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union as they were originally set up and the transformations which have been taking place in the post Cold War and in the globalizing environment. 
Expose students to cutting edge analyses which examine the political forces influencing the legal changes mentioned in point 3 above
Explore the ways in which forced migration is being dealt with in national and international law.Make explicit the opportunities which exist in domestic, EU and International law for migrants to seek remedies which will protect their fundamental human rights in the face of hostile political forces.  In doing this detailed consideration will be given to recent developments in the case law pertaining to these matters.
Study the links between human rights law, family law and migration.
Explore the economic outcomes of migration and how it has affected human rights law.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:

Specify the   complex legal framework within which our modern ideas of identity, belonging,   and citizenship are located.
Understand the legal framework relating to   refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union and the   transformations taking place therein.    In doing this students will be able to demonstrate an ability to   find their way around a complicated knowledge base which includes law   reports, constitutions, legal text books, works in the field of   international relations and also reports in the quality press.
Appreciate the political context surrounding   the complex relationship between human rights and migration policies   within the European context.
Engage with some of the thorny ethical issues   which are raised by the legal and political disputes surrounding the   problems of migration.
Understand and analyse the issue of forced   migration and the protection of refugees under international human rights   law.
Understand the question of rights and how this   relates to family life across national boundaries.Assess the impact of economic migration on   human rights law
