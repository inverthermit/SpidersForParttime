  This module provides a core introductory module for the MA in World History which will equip postgraduates with a variety of approaches to thinking historically beyond the nation state. It offers a broad introduction into the outline of world history since c. 1500, particularly in terms of the teaching range of scholars across the humanities at King's, in order to stimulate students to choose directions of reading and research which they may not previously have considered. The module involves students in the critical examination of the competing approaches to transnational history: comparative vs. connective history, &lsquo;histoires crois&eacute;es&rsquo;, Atlantic history and its critics, imperial history and its limits, &lsquo;postcolonialism&rsquo; and its discontents.

  Sport has been a critical cultural force in U.S. history, and is arguably as definitive for U.S. identities as film or music. However, its significance has often been overlooked. This course will discuss the development of modern sports in the United States from the mid-19th century on. It will focus on the emergence of sports clubs, the role of national sports heroes, the business of sports, and health reform movements. Sport will be discussed as a force of cultural production and social change. Through the prism of sports this course provides a new understanding of Progressivism, consumerism, and race and gender politics in 20th century U.S. history. It will also provide knowledge of a number of methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding the role of sports, the body, and spectacles in the shaping of modern societies and nations.

  In recent years the historiography of the &lsquo;end of empire&rsquo; has been one of the most rapidly-developing and exciting aspects of the literature on the history of British imperialism, driven not only by the continued opening up of records relating to the post-war period, but also by new controversies concerning Britain&rsquo;s response to colonial politics and insurrection, and the impact of decolonisation on Britain itself. The first part of the course provides an introduction to &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;how&rsquo; after the second world war Britain came to experience such a dramatic transformation in its world role, examining debates surrounding the relative importance of international relations, domestic politics and economy, and anti-colonial resistance in bringing about Britain&rsquo;s post-war retreat from empire. The course then proceeds to focus on country case studies that together illustrate the diverse nature of British decolonisation and the very different processes --from negotiation to armed revolt&mdash;by which former colonies attained their independence from Britain. The final part of the course explores the newly-emerging literature on the cultural, social, economic and political consequences for Britain of the transition from empire to Commonwealth. Students will be encouraged throughout to make comparison between British decolonisation and the experience of other European empires.

  This course will examine the ways in which the Cold War affected the UK&rsquo;s foreign, military and domestic policymaking in the broader European context. It will be the aim of this course to demonstrate that the Cold War was not simply a conflict between the two superpowers, with lesser powers like the UK simply acting as their agents, but that in UK&rsquo;s case the response was based upon the long history of Anglo-Russian and subsequently Anglo-Soviet relations; on the challenges that Britain faced as European power with a declining global Imperial presence; on her position in Europe after the World War II; on her military strength (or weakness); and her determination to remain on the &lsquo;top table&rsquo; of world affairs.
Topics covered will include: Anglo-Russian and Anglo-Soviet Relations in the European context until 1945; Britain and the origins of the Cold War in Europe; the development of the UK&rsquo;s nuclear deterrent; Britain and Western European Security (including the Helsinki Accords); the UK&rsquo;s response to the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI or Star Wars); the Falklands War; and the Fall of the Berlin Wall.

  The colonies of settlement have been neglected in studies of British imperialism in recent decades. This module will focus attention on the shared histories of Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa since the early-nineteenth century as part of a larger &lsquo;British World&rsquo;. These societies&rsquo; evolution from colonies to self-governing dominions and independent nations, as well as their common dispossession and marginalisation of Indigenous peoples, will be examined not only comparatively but also by exploring the sense of belonging that developed among them, based on shared origins, culture, experience and identity. The module will examine factors such as those which brought these various communities together &ndash; cultural, political, economic, constitutional and military &ndash; as well as the forces that eventually drove them apart from one another, and from Great Britain itself.

  he three keywords in the module title together evoke a particular historical conjuncture. We will look at two empires &ndash; the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian &ndash; as they contended with the rise of national sentiment at a time of rapid social, economic and cultural change (otherwise known as modernity). There will be a strong emphasis on comparative analysis, both as a way of capturing the historical specificity of these empires and as a means of reflecting more broadly on the nature of empire &ndash; a normal, not aberrant form of political organization for nineteenth-century Europe &ndash; at a historical moment when it was under interrogation as never before.

  In this module (which is designed to follow on from &lsquo;Empire, Nation and Modernity in Eastern Europe, 1848-1914', but can also be free-standing) we will examine two empires &ndash; the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian &ndash; as they faced the crisis of World War I and fell apart. We then go on to consider their successor states &ndash; above all the USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary &ndash; with particular reference to the ways in which they contended with national sentiment and ethnic difference at a time of rapid social, economic and cultural change. There will be a strong emphasis on comparative analysis, both as a way of capturing the historical specificity of these regions and as a means of reflecting more broadly on the interwar and postwar conjunctures.

  The aim of this module is to look at England (the module includes some reference to Scotland, Ireland and Wales) in European context. It will examine the ways in which the English thought of themselves as being different from their European neighbours, and the ways in which those European neighbours thought of the English as being different. The module is largely historiographical (and indeed will aim to stress that historical writing is itself a product of national culture). It will try to show how some famous interpretations of English history are rooted in comparison. More generally, the module will look at the ways in which England remembers, or forgets, its national history: it will ask, for example, why is it that every French person knows that 18 June 1940 is the date on which de Gaulle issued his &lsquo;call to honour&rsquo; while almost no English person knows that this is the day on which Churchill delivered his &lsquo;finest hour speech&rsquo; &ndash; or, for that matter, that it is the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. It will ask why there is a &lsquo;rue Winston Churchill&rsquo; in Paris, but no &lsquo;Churchill Avenue&rsquo; in central London. 
 It will focus on the period since 1918, and especially on that between 1918 and 1945, although writers on England almost invariably referred back to earlier periods, and such writers can in turn only be understood by looking at the long-term reception of their work. Attention will be paid to the new context in which ideas of England were discussed (the foundation of the BBC, the growth of English and History as subjects of study at universities). It will look at the inter-relationship of thinking about England with thinking about Europe, the Empire and Britain. 
 The module is intended to be a means of raising questions as much as of providing answers and it is hoped that it will prove particularly useful to those who are going to go on to do graduate work in British history.

  The purpose of this course is to study the process of European expansion and its impact on the definition of ethnic prejudices, hierarchies of peoples and race relations. We will study the both the reflection in Europe on different peoples of the world resulting from the Oceanic exploration, as well as the practice of colonial societies established in Africa, Asia and America. The tension between ethnic prejudices and civil rights will be at the core of this module. We will include the debates on freedom of the American Indians, on African slavery, on the abolition of the slave trade and slavery, and on the recognition of citizenship for Native Americans and African freedmen.

  This module will offer an overview of French imperial ventures in the modern era, from France&rsquo;s American empire in the early modern period to the Napoleonic empires of the nineteenth century and its African and Indochinese empire after 1870. Recent years have seen a reappraisal of both the French contribution to the development of European imperialism and the impact of imperial expansion on France and continental Europe. Comparisons between the French and other European empires, especially Britain&rsquo;s, have played a significant part in the surge of interest in world and imperial history. The large time span covered by the module will encourage students to analyse the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of empire throughout the modern era. A simultaneously comparative and connective approach will familiarize students with several core concepts of world history, including the striking of the balance between change and continuity in long historical narratives and the complex relations between centres and their peripheries. Special attention will be paid to colonial revolutions in a French imperial context such as in Haiti in the eighteenth century, Germany under Napoleon, and Algeria in the twentieth century. Knowledge of French is not required.

  In 1900, Harlem was an affluent neighbourhood whose largest ethnic group was Jewish. By the 1920s, however, Harlem was home to the world&rsquo;s largest black urban community, its name widely employed as a synonym for black America. This module explores the processes of migration, segregation and congregation through which Harlem became and remained a black community, and also reconstructs the multiple meanings Harlem acquired over the course of a century for its residents and for media, literary authors, visual artists, social scientists and others in the United States and beyond. Beginning with the demographic transformations that remade the neighbourhood in the early twentieth century&mdash;including the influx of migrants from the Caribbean and the American South&mdash;the module then considers the political and artistic ferment of the 1920s and 1930s and interrogates the notion of a &lsquo;Harlem Renaissance.&rsquo; Subsequent topics examine the social and intellectual forces that recast the neighbourhood&rsquo;s symbolic significance, as Harlem&rsquo;s image as the frontier of black progress was displaced by the notion of Harlem as the archetypal American &lsquo;ghetto.&rsquo; Processes such as deindustrialisation and the impact of public housing policy will be read in conjunction with postwar representations of Harlem in journalism, the social sciences, fiction, poetry, documentary photography, film, and the visual arts. Finally, the module looks to the controversies surrounding &lsquo;gentrification&rsquo; in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Throughout, the module seeks to illuminate the significance of place in the production of racial discourse&mdash;by drawing on work by historians, cultural geographers and cultural theorists&mdash;in order to understand Harlem&rsquo;s enduring symbolic capital within discussions of black life in the United States and beyond.

  This module is aimed at surveying the history of science, technology and medicine in India from the late 18th to the 20th centuries. The module focuses on mapping the introduction of European science and its continuing practice in India. It will pose three questions through current scholarship: when and how was the cultural authority of European science established in India; how was local pursuit of knowledge of the physical world reconfigured in this process; what did the process of accepting the ontology of European science come to mean in the period under discussion?
The module will examine each of our readings to understand how these questions have been addressed in the current scholarship on history of science, technology and medicine in India, especially in relation to the state. In the process of studying these questions, students will develop: a comprehensive understanding of the structure and development of science in India since the mid C18th; the ability to analyse the relationship between western science and Indian social practice and culture; an understanding of the relationship between science and the state; an appreciation of the centrality of science to Indian politics and culture today.

  The rise of inequality during the past thirty years, after one century of increased equality, puzzles economists. The main conditions and factors of inequality need to be understood through long term historical research. This module analyses key practices, institutions and ideas which have produced inequality. Economic, political, educational and gendered realities will be addressed in their context. The impact of the European expansion will be at the centre of our concerns. The Portuguese-speaking world will be compared to other areas exposed to the historical influence of Spanish, British, Dutch and French imperialism. The long-term direct impact of the European expansion on the New World and, to a lesser degree, on Africa, will be compared to its indirect modern impact on Asia. Local dynamics of prejudice, discrimination and segregation concerning lineages, castes and races will be discussed alongside the emergence of class and status groups in different parts of the world. The debate on inequality is premised on diverse concepts of equality, and these form another thematic focus. Students will be able to connect current debates to solid historical knowledge about ideas and practices and will encounter a wealth of further less explored areas inviting future research.

  This module introduces students to the history of modern anti-colonial nationalism by examining the emergence of nationalism and nation-states in the region once ruled as Britain's Indian empire. Students will focus in particular on the way the inhabitants of South Asia responded to imperial rule by writing about the history of the communities they belonged to, emphasising the diverse ways in which the nation was imagined in the process. Students will examine the changing documentary form of South Asian nationalism by reading texts by political leaders from Rammohan Roy in the 1820s to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the 1970s, placing them in their social and political contexts and examining how the states of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh emerged in the process. Alongside these primary sources, students will consider a number of recent historical interpretations of South Asian politics and theories of both nationalism and narrativity. In the process, they will consider throughout how far the stories people tell about the history community can be realistic, or if modern nationalist story-telling involves forms of writing necessarily out of joint with the way historical actors lived their lives at the time.

  This module examines the interface between the writing of naval history and development of naval education and national strategy in the period between the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War and the twenty-first century. 
Aims:
The aims of the module are to examine the key issues in the development of naval history and strategy, both as case studies in history, and as historiographical and methodological exercises. It works alongside the MA War Studies and History of Warfare Core Programme, especially the History and Strategy components. The methods of historical enquiry that are set out in those elements will be the starting point for the work of this module. The case studies have been selected with reference to the current state of knowledge in the fields covered, and do not form a continuous narrative.
Learning Outcomes:
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to:
Understand the way in which the writing of history reflects the environment in which it is written, the objects of the historian and the importance of academic or service links in naval history.
Display a critical understanding of the use of evidence, argument and narrative in history
Assess the development of national naval strategies, both at a national, and a comparative level.
Demonstrate a critical approach to historiographical issues, enabling them to analyse both historical issues, and the work of the historians who have written about them.

  Iran's traumatic encounter with Russian and British imperialism in the modern age did not only bring the country into direct contact with two powerful and aggressive European nations. It also brought about a deep sense of insecurity towards a foreign form of military, economic, political and social modernity that the Iranian intellectual elites will attempt to comprehend, emulate, reject, or hybridise. From the early modernists and constitutionalists who aimed to reform the Iranian state to catch up with Europe, to nativisits and Islamists who emphatically rejected the Pahlavi state's westernisation programme, Iranian intellectuals of the modern period have all, in one way or the other, been 'obsessing with the West'. This module will cover modern Iran's intellectual history in order to shed light on this momentous, and often painful, process of transformation. In other terms, this is a history of Iran's entry into modernity, seen through the eyes of intellectuals.

  This module explores patriotism and national identities in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Britain. What did contemporaries mean by patriotism? Did patriotic considerations play a major part in policymaking? Or did the political significance of patriotism lie more in the realm of popular appeals? To what extent was the language of patriotism a contested one? A particular concern of this module is the relationship between patriotism, national identity and imperialism. Were British nationalisms typically synonymous or compatible with imperialism, or did patriotic loyalties alien to the imperial spirit often intrude? How powerful was &lsquo;Little Englander&rsquo; patriotism? 
 The module takes a thematic approach. Topics include: the politics and culture of rural &lsquo;Englishness&rsquo;; the constitution and the English past; Edwardian militarism; Labour, Conservative and Liberal patriotism; the Monarchy; gender and nationhood; Irish, Scottish and Welsh nationalisms; Race; God and nation; British national identities and world war. While the main focus of this module is political, it is more concerned with the intellectual content of political discourse than the details of partisan politicking. In addition, it pays considerable attention to the role of patriotic and nationalistic discourse in British culture. The politics of patriotism cannot be understood without consideration of the wider cultural context in which these politics were situated.

  &lsquo;Pommyland&rsquo; was first used by Australians as a descriptive term for Britain in 1916. Its double-edged meaning &ndash; intimating affection as well as censure &ndash; captures a sense of collective uncertainty regarding the place of Australians in a country so familiar yet strange. Until the 1950s, Australians commonly referred to Britain as &lsquo;Home&rsquo;, but their expectations did not always match their experiences. This module explores the long history (from 1793) of these encounters, asking questions including: Where does Britishness end and Australianness begin? How, over time, has the Australian presence in Britain been imagined, experienced and established? When a trip &lsquo;Home&rsquo; became a &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; visit, how did Australians here respond, on the ground? To what extent has there been &ndash; and is there &ndash; an Australian community here?

  The importance and dynamic of religion is one of the most striking features of American society. But it is also surprising in that it contradicts the assumption that modern societies are secularized. The course analyzes the role of religious rhetoric in political discourse, the role of different religious pressure groups and the important Supreme Court decisions that are related to the field of religion such as Roe v. Wade. The course will discuss the concept of civil religion, the meaning of the First Amendment in U.S. constitutional history, and contemporary secularization theories. It will provide knowledge of a number of methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding how religion has influenced images of the nation, civic values, and political campaigns in the 20th century. Examining how religion has been contested provides indispensable insights into twentieth-century U.S. culture and U.S. politics.

  What is India? How can we understand contemporary history and politics of India in the global context? And finally, how and to what extent has science been a part of the process of making India? In this course, we will work with these three questions in Indian history for the period roughly between 1930 and the present. We begin with the impossibility of the idea of India divided under imperial rule in the interwar period, and quickly move on to trace the transformation of this landscape in the post]war period - shaped by Cold War politics and the converging interests of various international processes. Cautiously drawing a distinction between science and technology, which were relevant to the historical actors in question, the course will begin with projects promoted by the Indian National Congress and the Imperial government, followed by projects under Nehru's administration in independent India and finally work through the effects and aftermath of India's more recent history of market liberalism. An important goal for this course is to understand the landscape of state-led transformation of India through scientific education and research, while simultaneously paying close attention to responses &ndash; both critical and favourable - from the citizens of India, as well as the perception of India in the world at large.

  This course is aimed at thinking broadly about the experiences and meanings of science and technology for the global population during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will focus on key themes in twentieth century global history: public health, race, global trade, decolonisation, modernisation, the nuclear age, green revolution and population control. We want to understand the normative and moral aspects of the debates and arguments around the "civilizing mission" under European colonialism through "modernization" during the Cold War under the global leadership of the United States and the Soviet Union, and how this transition of world politics was played out globally with respect to science and technology. We will see that interactions between cultures have often been negotiated through practices concerning the control and regulation of territories and populations. The ideas around civilisation and progress that helped legitimate these practices under colonial rule, continued through the period after World War II, providing the foundations for efforts to develop and modernise the emerging decolonised world. Through close attention to ideas and processes (more than on details of specific cases), we will examine the diversity of the historical actors and the context of their interactions.

  An introduction to the history and historiography of the British Empire from its Tudor origins to decolonization. It aims, first, to give students an introduction to the development of British imperial history as as a discipline, and, second, to prepare them to teach the subject. It moves between the history of the imperial center, and the stories of encounter, settlement, violence, resistance, and of the transformation of lifeways and identity, at the American, Asian, African, and Pacific peripheries of British influence.

  This module examines the nature of heroism. It seeks to answer questions to the following: What is a hero? What is a heroine? Why is heroism such an important historical phenomenon? Is there a distinctively 'modern' form of it? Many of the examples will be British, however students are encouraged to develop a comparative perspective on the subject. They will also be invited to reflect critically upon both the range of relevant sources (medals and monuments, for example, as well as biographies and autobiographies) and the ways in which historians have approached the subject. Those who were publicly celebrated come from a variety of fields, and indeed there is also a history of forms of achievement. Thus the module will also examine certain key zones -- the church, the military, science, medicine, literature, architecture and so on -- in order to assess their changing status. The professions, class and gender, and their representation, will be central issues in the module.

  This module offers a historical and critical perspective on the making of the contemporary Muslim Question in Europe. In essence it does three things:
It places the making of the Muslim Question in the history of both the relations between European states and their Muslim populations from colonial subjecthood, through immigration regimes to postcolonial citizenship, and of the geopolitics of inter-national and transnational articulations and politics of imperial, nation state and European formations;
It takes a critical and comparative approach to the making of the Muslim Question in relation to the other (Jewish, Woman, Nationalities, Colour, Religious) &lsquo;Questions&rsquo;, their contexts, framings, and politics;
It proposes a genealogical and critical historiographical reflection on the emergence of the Muslim subject, Muslim subjectivities and political identities, and the writing of the history of Muslims in Europe and its spatial contexts.

  The module will offer a comprehensive overview of economic systems of imperial governance since 1500 and economic theories about imperialism. Economic motivation has always been a crucial dimension of imperial projects, but it was expressed or interpreted in different ways throughout the modern era. The module will introduce students to the successive strands of economic thinking that shaped imperial expansion, from the mercantilist reliance on slave-manned plantations and tight commercial regulations to obtain a trade surplus to the liberal economic thought that underpinned &lsquo;free trade imperialism&rsquo; in the nineteenth century and the early formulations of development policies in the twentieth century. The module will also encourage students to engage with the main historical debates about the economics of European imperialism, including the concept of &lsquo;world-system&rsquo;, the links between industrialization and overseas expansion, and the neo-imperialist character of modern international economic institutions. No prior knowledge of economics is required, as the module will focus on general concepts and the connections between the economic and the political, social, and cultural dimensions of imperialism.

  This module examines the historical process by which Britain emerged as the dominant governing power in India from the 1750s to 1830s. The transition to colonialism remains one of the most fiercely contested issues in Indian and imperial history, a question which intersects with British and Indian historical identities in important ways. Aware of these present-day contexts throughout, the module introduces students to debates about the nature of both Indian and British society before during and after the colonial encounter, encouraging them to see the transition to colonialism as a process in which all participants &ndash; whether Indian or British - were transformed. Students will consider the ways in which the colonial regime produced records about its own activities, engaging with sources available in the India Office Records in the British Library. In particular, they will use both primary and secondary material to explore the changing ideas about politics and power that emerged from the process of colonial state-formation, considering how far historians need to consider the emergence of colonial governance as the creation of an unprecedented form of rule that transformed life in many different spheres.

  This course examines American political culture in the 20th Century. It will provide an inter-disciplinary knowledge of different methods and theories to decode American political culture and a sound understanding of the concept of political culture. In thematic sections it will explore the cultural layers of the presidency, of populist and political protest movements. It examines these in the context of the ongoing processes of nation building and identity construction in the United States, especially in their connections to race, gender, popular culture, and the media. In reading U.S. political history through cultural phenomena like scandals, moral panics, and conspiracies, the course provides original insight into the unique nature of American democracy, society, and nation.
