  The dissertation provides an opportunity for students to follow their own interests by investigating a particular issue in depth. The objective of the dissertation is for students to design and execute a research project on a subject of their own choice. The dissertation should identify a research problem and attempt to 'solve' it through the collection and analysis of primary or secondary data. The dissertation should be written as if it was to be submitted to an academic journal for publication, with a clear statement of objectives, an assessment of the merits of undertaking this piece of research (eg lack of knowledge about it, disagreements in the literature, failure of previous studies to consider certain potential causal circumstances), an explanation and justification of the methods and data that have been used, an evaluation of the results obtained and a consideration of how the research has met its original aims. Students are expected to present dissertations that are based on original research, involving empirical analysis or computer simulation. Special permission must be sought from the Master's Tutor for a dissertation to be entirely philosophical or conceptual in content. 
Opportunity will be made available in the Practising Social Research 1/Methods for Environmental Research modules (where applicable) in the first semester to discuss appropriate projects and a design for the research project must be produced and will be examined.

  This module aims to provide a background in issues and methods involved in doing environmental research, including research methods and design. To achieve this, the module consists of a series of lectures, seminars, and practicals giving an overview of methods in designing, analyzing, presenting and evaluating environmental research. A subcomponent of this module will be an additional unassessed but required set of practicals and seminars giving a overview of laboratory and field equipment available in the KCL Department of Geography. On completion of this module, the student will be able to define the features of environmental problems and will be able to assess environmental investigations in terms of their design strategies for collection of data, data analysis, and results presentation. When taken with SG/5111 the students will be fully equipped to carry out their own independent research into environmental problems using these methodologies.

  This module is organised around three main themes that have been central to the way that thinkers have conceptualised the city: shape, circulation and crowds. Shape refers to the physical form and layout of the city which together comprise its legibility; circulation refers to the importance of movement, networks and transactional spaces in the city; and the crowd refers to the significance of anonymity and numbers of people in cities. Each of these themes is explored in the context of different theoretical approaches that have been important in the history of urban thought.

Assessing urban growth patterns in this region and its periodization and the changing nature of rural-urban migration and linkages over time. The constraints on planning and servicing imposed by extreme resource constraints and the privatization encouraged by structural adjustment are evaluated. The module also explores the specificities of the urban experience in southern African countries with their legacies of institutionalised and racially-based influx control.
