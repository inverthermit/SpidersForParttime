  The module is intended for students who are converting into Philosophy at Master's level, and is designed to offer them a broad overview of the general state of play in four key branches of the discipline: Ethics, Political Philosophy, Metaphysics, Epistemology. In essence, it will teach people who might opt to specialise in one area of Philosophy the kinds of basic things that they are likely to be expected to know about the others; as well as providing an appreciation of the interconnected, systematic nature of Philosophy as a whole. There will be a five-week block devoted to each of these four areas. In addition, students will receive training in elementary Symbolic Logic through separate classes, following the main lectures across all twenty weeks.
