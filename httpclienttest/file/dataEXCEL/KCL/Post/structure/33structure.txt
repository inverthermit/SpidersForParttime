  The aim of the course is to bring you into critical engagement with biblical texts through a range of commentaries from a variety of periods reflecting a wide range of hermeneutical approaches. You will develop not only an awareness of your own hermeneutical assumptions when approaching the text, but also an 'intellectual empathy' for approaches that are not your own. Beyond this, you will learn how to analyse and evaluate the various exegetical methods employed, to negotiate between conflicting interpretations and to reflect on the hermeneutical issues that arise.

  This module will consider the history of the study of so-called &lsquo;Biblical archaeology&rsquo; and the main methodological issues involved. It will trace the history of this discipline, and then focus on the critical topics that have arisen over the past fifty years in terms of the relationship between the Bible and archaeological evidence. The module will be organised chronologically to consider initially how the archaeological discoveries throughout the Near East have impacted on understandings of the Genesis narratives, through to the dating of the Exodus, the discoveries of comparative law codes (for Mosaic Law), the &lsquo;conquest&rsquo; of Canaan and features of the beginning of the Iron Age, dating and defining David and the &lsquo;United Kingdom&rsquo; (maximalist and minimalist theories), Iron Age II and the Babylonian Conquest, the Persian and Hellenistic periods and later canonical and deutero-canonical/apocryphal literature; Jesus and the emerging church within Second Temple Judaism and the archaeology of first-century Judaea and Galilee; Jewish Diaspora (synagogues/community) and the earliest churches; the media and Biblical archaeology.
Students will be required to give a short seminar on a chosen topic during class time and be expected to prepare for each seminar by reading the Biblical texts relevant to the topics for each week.
[As an optional addition following on from this module, it is hoped that permission will be given by the Israel Antiquities Authority for a small Iron Age II site to be licensed to Dr. Taylor and Israeli archaeologist Professor Shimon Gibson, allowing the opportunity for interested students to participate in a small-scale excavation in Israel (two weeks) as a separate follow-up to this module in the summer term. If this is not available then another excavation opportunity can be easily organised. This will be purely for interest only, for experience, and no credits are awarded for this]

  Biblical texts are explored as responses to violence (human and divine, physical and verbal), and as mechanisms (ritual and legal) for ordering chaos. Models of crime and punishment, law and order, atonement and sacrifice, covenant and contract will be viewed as constructions through which injustice was rationalized and physical loss, including the trauma of exile, was reconfigured. The reshaping of violence in biblical memory, with its dramatic legacy in eschatological and apocalyptic texts, will be examined to include further striking elements which crystallize in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

  This module is devoted to the study of the passion narratives of the canonical Gospels (with some attention to the non-canonical Gospels) and their reception within creative media. Initially there will be a focus on the texts, as well as the social, political, historical and archaeological background relevant to the debates concerning the death of Jesus. Following this, the second part of the course will be an examination and analysis of the representation of the passion in art, literature and film. Students will explore how the passion of Jesus has been utilised and depicted in a variety of artistic, literary and cinematic productions. This will be done through individual student presentations. The presentation will consist of a summary of work in progress towards a final essay on a specific topic chosen from a selection of options. Classes will be seminar style with a strong emphasis on student participation. Class sessions will focus on:

set texts from the passion narratives of the four Gospels, which students will be expected to have studied in advance using appropriate commentaries and other relevant secondary literature;
teaching sessions, mainly concerning relevant history and archaeology; and
student presentations, which ideally should involve a visual component

There will be a strong emphasis on discussion and evaluation.

  How is the development of Christian theology conditioned by pagan philosophical, theological, and artistic creations? Are all creedal forms necessarily the product of a political theology legitimating a political order? We will study the emergence of Christian orthodoxy out of originally diverse groups, Jewish, Hellenistic, Roman and the historical events that shaped that development through the analysis of key texts.

  This modules involves detailed exegetical and theological study of one or more of Paul&rsquo;s writings. Selected passages will be studied in Greek. The course thus presupposes that students have learned the elements of New Testament Greek and are equipped to handle New Testament texts in Greek. In 2011/2, the text is Romans 5-8. Romans is one of the most influential texts in ecclesiastical and Western history. We will examine in detail the central portion the epistle, a stretch of text that raises important theological issues such as the origins of sin, the scope of human salvation, the meaning of baptism, the nature of life in the Spirit, the role of the law, and the place of the wider creation in the divine purpose.
Students with no academic background in Pauline studies should &ndash; in advance of the module &ndash; read David Horrell&rsquo;s An Introduction to the Study of Paul, second edition; T T Clark International: London, 2006, and a work on Paul&rsquo;s theology, such as James D.G.Dunn&rsquo;s&rsquo; The Theology of Paul the Apostle, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998. In particular cases, the tutor may advice auditing the undergraduate course, 5AAT2020 Paul in Context, alongside this module.

The module will cover a range of different approaches and understandings in the study of the Gospels. It will provide an educational environment that will stimulate discussion, thought and learning, provoking a critical awareness of ground-breaking work in the study of the Gospels over the past century, with particular emphasis on current issues.

  The module will teach students about the sustained and rich discussion of the theme of the beautiful in the Western Church, a discussion which runs through every century of its history and has often provoked fierce contention (as in the Reformation). It will introduce students to this tradition, tracing its debts to classical models of the relationsihp between beauty and goodness (especially in the works of Plotinus), through the medieval discussions of beauty as a transcendental (especially in the work of Aquinas), to the theological influence on philosophical aesthetics in the 18th and 19th centuries (including the observation of a distinctively British tradition in Coleridge, Ruskin, Hopkins and others). It will conclude with the major works in the area of theological aesthetics that have been produced since the 20th century (Jacques Maritain, David, Jones, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Davie Bentley Hart, Rowan Williams). The module will encourage students to judge the status of 'aesthetics' as a theological locus, and to relate the philosophical and theological discussions they encounter to actual works of art.

  This module aims to provide a grounding in the advanced study of theology as a doctrinal discipline. It therefore focuses firstly upon the history of doctrine (Trinity, Christology, Ecclesiology) before proceeding to examine some of the primary ways in which theology has developed contextual expressions and critiques of doctrine. The emphasis is upon learning the parameters within which the different theological schools are doctrinally shaped and formed. The module examines a number of contemporary theological projects which seek to recontextualise doctrinal traditions within current modes of understanding.

  Popular as it has become in recent decades to distinguish between cataphatic (affirmative) and apophatic (negative) theologies, they are distinguished in very different ways historically in the Western theological traditions. One such way of making that distinction associates the apophatic way of "unknowing" with reason, which, unlike the cataphatic way of faith and revelation, has no access to the inner nature of God; but within other traditions the distinction between the apophatic and the cataphatic falls within both reason and revelation, if in different ways in the two cases. This course examines the complex history of the inter-relation between the two sets of distinctions, the apophatic/cataphatic and reason/revelation, in some primary texts stretching from the sixth century Syrian monk known as the Pseudo-Denys to the late nineteenth century atheist, Friedrich Nietzsche.

  This module engages with a series of literary texts across historical periods from the perspective of both their theological content and contexts. It therefore offers an analytical, hermeneutical approach to both the history of theological literature (Augustine, Eckhart, Dante), and to theologically related literatures (H&ouml;lderlin, Paul Celan and Yves Bonnefoy), as well as to the hermeneutics of language use in specifically theological frameworks (Pauline texts). In this module we will further the study of both the implicit and explicit understandings of language, its possibilities and limitations, in different theological contexts and genres.
