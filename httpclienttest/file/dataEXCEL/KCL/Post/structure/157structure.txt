   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  There are two teaching days each week. All modules are run as seminars, with a mixture of formal presentation by the instructor and active discussion among members of the seminar. Instructors are also available outside of seminars, and during the dissertation phase students will have personal guidance from a specific instructor. Assessment for first term modules is by exam, and for second term modules by essay.

  Module description
When standards of moral business conduct conflict across international borders, whose standards should prevail?
Do corporations have a duty to promote just institutions?
Is it the role of government to regulate the activities of companies or do we as
consumers have a part to play?
Given their scale, influence and reach, multinational corporations find themselves confronted with issues of human rights violations, situations of extreme poverty and depravation and cases of serious environmental harm. What should their response be in such cases, where they are called upon to balance the competing demands of the market, public opinion, divergent moral standards and different regulatory requirements? Is it enough simply to comply with the relevant legislation or should corporations be understood within a wider context of social and ethical relationships?
Lectures:
1. Citizenship and Corporate Social Responsibility
Is &lsquo;the social responsibility of a firm to increase its profits&rsquo;? Or do
businesses have wider civic and moral duties? Examining the concept and
conditions of citizenship, we ask whether this ideal helps us to articulate or
justify the responsibilities and virtues of the firm.
2.  Global Corporations and Human Rights
Is it enough that corporations refrain from violating human rights, or should
they seek to promote higher standards of welfare and liberties in countries in
which they operate? Is it permissible for companies to use their considerable
influence to bring about political change with respect to the protection of
human rights? Is it their duty?
3.  Exploitation, the Market and International Labour
Is it ethically acceptable for multinational corporations to pay market wage
rates in developing countries even if these wages are less than a &lsquo;living wage&rsquo;
or subsistence level? Does it make a difference this wage is freely accepted by (reasonably) informed workers?
4.  Financial Services and the Vulnerable
Businesses can be held to have a duty of care to vulnerable clients. Does that
extend to financial services institutions (FSIs)? Are there special duties on FSIs when dealing with the poor and vulnerable? The case of microfinance. An industry set up to help 200m of the world&rsquo;s poorest work their way out of poverty: does it empower or exploit?
5.  Financial Scandals, Bank Failures and the Cost of Crashes
Because of their leverage and global interconnectedness, when multinational
financial services institutions get in to financial difficulty themselves, the
consequences for society can be much more serious than for a failing
nonfinancial business. What link, if any, is there between financial scandals,
bank failures and market crashes? Are bank failures and market crashes an
inevitable part of capitalism or can they be prevented? What were the ultimate
causes and costs of the 08 global financial crash and who bore them?

  Module description
This module looks first at wars of national conflict. Are such wars inevitable? Do they have origins in ineliminable parts of our psychology? Is it possible to devise a world order that would contain our tendencies towards conflict and replace the rule of force by the rule of law? Or is it inevitable that countries strongest in military terms will refuse to accept an international order not based on military domination? Is it possible to base an international order on anything other than national self-interest?
The second part of the module looks at the ethics of terrorism and of counterterrorism. Is the traditional theory of the just war the right guide to a world in which terrorism is common? Can terrorism itself ever be justified? Can torture be justified as part of a strategy to combat terrorism? What should be done about the danger of nuclear terrorism?

  Module description
We shall assume, in this module, that moral responsibilities of some sort exist. But the nature, scope and basis of these responsibilities are all up for debate and discussion. The module is structured to facilitate such discussion.
For example:
do we have responsibilities only to, or for, our fellow humans, or do these responsibilities extend also to all sentient beings, all living beings, or even to nonliving beings and communities of living and non-living beings?
if our responsibilities extend beyond our fellow humans, do they depend solely on the service that non-human beings provide to humans, or do non-human beings merit consideration in their own right?
if our responsibilities extend beyond our fellow humans, how do we weigh our obligations to humans against our obligations to other beings?
whatever the scope of our responsibilities, do they extend into the future (or past), and if so how far?
do we adequately discharge our responsibilities to humans and non-humans by making them fit the world e.g. through population control and genetic modification, rather than by making the world fit for them?
if justice and just dealing is a major element of our responsibilities to one another, how far can the requirements of justice be met when we attempt to meet our responsibilities to the world and its future?

In the first part of the module, we attempt to chart the &lsquo;landscape&rsquo; of responsibility. In the second part, we engage with some more practical policy issues. Bear in mind that, as we wrestle in the second part with the concrete challenges, we may well find reason to change the provisional views we had reached in the first part about the scope and basis of our responsibilities.

  Module description
The primary aim of this course is to foster critical thinking about human rights by developing skills in weighing powerful but opposed arguments and skills in evaluating complex moral situations. Through lectures and tutorials we will explore a variety of alleged human rights and ask: Which of these is really a human right? What could the justification of human rights be? If some right is a real human right, what exactly does it require of us and others? Are human rights absolute? Are there really any human rights at all, or are human rights just another means for Western societies to impose their way of life on the rest of the world?

  Module description
This module seeks to build on many of the theoretical issues about justice and the impact of globalisation covered in the political philosophy module. However, it will focus primarily on some of the most pressing practical problems of justice which are thrown up by the forces of globalisation. What, for instance, should the response of a nation to large numbers of immigrants? How should we understand &lsquo;poverty&rsquo; and what obligations do we have to alleviate it? What are the most effective means to achieving just solutions to global problems? Does it matter morally that there are huge differences in health, education and job prospects among individuals born in different countries?

  Module description
The magical or tribal or collectivist society will also be called the closed society, and the society in which individuals are confronted with personal decisions, the open society&hellip; The Greeks started for us that great revolution which, it seems, is still in its beginning &ndash;the transition from the closed to the open society&hellip; Perhaps the most powerful cause of the breakdown of the closed society was the development of seacommunications and commerce. Close contact with other tribes is liable to undermine the feeling of necessity with which tribal institutions are viewed.
KARL POPPER: The Open Society and its Enemies, Vol. 1, Ch 10.
The global age of new technology and increased flows of people and information has meant that the interaction between different cultures is increasing at an unprecedented pace. Our knowledge and experiences of other cultures are vastly greater and more accessible, while our own societies have become much more diverse in terms of its cultural make up.
The fact of increased cultural interaction raises a number of issues. Alongside the benefits of greater diversity come key challenges. Increased interaction could lead to the demise of certain cultures, which raises the question of whether steps should be taken to protect a particular way of life where it is under threat. But do all cultures have such a claim to protection? Further what is encompassed by such a right to culture? Is it a collective right that may trump other important individual rights? Do illiberal cultures have a right to protection? The question of illiberal cultures is key in relation to how we regard the situation of women in other societies whose cultures subject them to systematic injustice? Should something be done about unjust cultural arrangements?
Our societies are increasingly multicultural in nature, in ways that prompt reconsideration of what equality and justice mean. Just as gender blindness has been shown to advantage men, does the recognition of cultural difference require differential treatment? Or does cultural exceptionalism undermine a fundamental? On the other hand, the backlash against multiculturalism and immigration in Europe is borne of a view that multicultural tolerance has gone too far, and that integration requires the active rejection of certain cultural norms. The debate over whetherIslamic beliefs can ever be compatible with Western secular values is very much live in countries such as France, the Netherlands and Germany where measures such as the banning of the burqa have attracted controversy.
Lastly, the insistence by some liberals on not tolerating illiberal cultures raises a big question over the universality of liberal political values. Could it be, as some Asian commentators have argued, that democracy and human rights are Western constructs that cannot be imposed wholesale on non-Western societies. Are they right to suggest that cultural differences could justice non-democratic regimes? Or do these arguments simply serve to shore up the power of the non-democratic elites?
