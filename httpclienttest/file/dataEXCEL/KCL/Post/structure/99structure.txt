Determine differential diagnoses
Evaluate factors in patient histories for relationships to their skin disease
Develop strategies for the treatment and management of patients
Develop clinical examination techniques relevant to dermatology
Determine which skin manifestations can be indicators of other diseases
Determine appropriate techniques for sampling and the appropriate tests to request
Assessment is by clinical exam, oral exam and submission of a clinical portfolio
