   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  This Masters programme is assessed through a combination of assignments, written examinations, clinical case presentations and a dissertation. In the first three years, most modules within the programme are assessed by a combination of 60 per cent written examination and 40 per cent written assignments. Each year you will receive an assignment schedule to follow for the year and must complete a minimum of four assignments from each module between January and August to be entered into the end of year exams. 
Exams can be taken in London or, for overseas students, at centres in the student's country of residence. Further details of overseas exam arrangements and applicable fees can be viewed at

If you fail an examination at the first sitting, you will be permitted one further attempt. Throughout the four years clinical work is also undertaken, which is assessed by submission of clinical case presentations. In the final year, you will be allocated a supervisor and undertake a dissertation or project between January and September. The dissertation provides the mark for Year 4.
