  Practicing lawyers are often confronted with the limitations of having to rely on precedent or legislation when advising clients in areas of &lsquo;new&rsquo; law, or where court decisions and statutory regulations are not yet sufficiently available. While this might be due to the fact that the law &ndash; in a domestic setting &ndash; is only slowly awakening to a recently emerged regulatory problem, this governance lag is amplified in the context of transnational activities, where issues of sovereignty, jurisdiction and forum pose additional obstacles to the creation of effective legal regulation. Practically speaking, lawyers in such cases frequently resort to team work, experts, stakeholders and other relevant parties &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo;, eventually shifting their strategy from litigation to a combination of legal consultancy, advocacy, coalition building and even public awareness building. This type of lawyering requires considerable flexibility, competences and resources, which are not readily available to every lawyer. From a theoretical perspective, the lawyer might find herself overwhelmed by what can be the technical or cognitive as well as the moral complexity of the case setting she is working on.
At the centre of the module is the shift away from training lawyers in learning and interpreting the law primarily through the study of jurisprudence (case law as in the common law tradition) or through the interpretation of statutory law (legislation &ndash; civil law tradition). Instead, students are invited to take on the perspective of the lawyer/advocate/activist who is involved in &lsquo;building&rsquo; a case from a set of diverse, inchoate and constantly evolving facts and data. This reversal of perspective is a crucial element in confronting students as future practitioners with the real-world challenges of an effective access to justice.
Assuming the position of legal practice and rights advocacy, students immerse themselves into a case from the &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; by identifying and negotiating the affected and involved interests, finding and navigating the applicable law, including, possibly, &lsquo;soft&rsquo; law, codes of conduct, social norms etcetera, and developing a legal interest representation strategy (&ldquo;LIRS&rdquo;). In contrast to giving legal advice to a client in a more or less confined and concrete legal question regarding, for example; liability, entitlement, conviction or acquittal, the development of a LIRS might include a variety of avenues, including, but not limited to, designing a litigation or defence strategy, the enhancing of legal and political rights, engaging in coalition and public awareness building or contributing to a sustainable stakeholder interest representation process.

  Media regularly report on the involvement of companies in human rights violations, for example, disasters in Bangladeshi clothing factories such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in which over 1,000 employees died; suicides at the Chinese Foxconn company where mobile phone companies had their products manufactured, and FIFA being accused of corruption and the death of scores of workers building the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This module includes various case studies of companies involved in human rights violations either through subsidiaries, business partners or the supply chain.
The existing legal framework to deal with these problems is limited and fragmented. In the US, the Alien Tort Statute provides a basis for litigation but in the Kiobel case, the US Supreme Court has substantially limited the Statute's scope. In Europe, particularly the UK and the Netherlands, companies are sued on the basis of domestic tort law, for example; Trafigura for waste dumping in Ivory Coast and Shell for polluting the Niger Delta. One of the questions addressed in this module, is what the future of US and European litigation is.
This module will also look into how the large gaps in the existing legal framework can be filled. So far, 'hard' law chiefly concentrates on companies' obligations to report about their human rights impact, while 'soft' law issued by international institutions (including the United Nations non-binding Framework and Guidelines and the OECD Guidelines) helps businesses to respect human rights. Moreover, governments nudge companies in the right direction in the context of trade missions, public procurement and export credit conditions. Companies also increasingly regulate each other, such as investors, pension funds, banks and insurers, investing in or financing business projects (and then, for example, applying the Equator principles). Finally, companies increasingly design their own Corporate Social Responsibility policies to ensure they respect human rights. This is a fast moving area of the law that is becoming of pivotal importance for companies, governments and human rights NGOs.

  This module examines the construction of constitutions and the structure of government around the world. Focusing on some of the most disparate countries including Germany, Iraq, and South Africa, the course seeks to understand the wide variety of institutions among existing democracies, paying attention to both constitutional 'success' and constitutional 'failure'. We will examine the differences between parliamentary and presidential systems, federal and unitary states, constitutional courts and supreme courts, and proportional and majoritarian electoral systems. We will also examine and compare the various rights that get constitutional status in some democracies (such as human dignity in Germany) and then assess whether the country's constitutional structure adequately allows for the protection of those rights.

  The last twenty-five years have seen an increased involvement of Western states in military operations abroad, including peace-keeping missions, military action in the so-called &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo; and several instances of &lsquo;humanitarian&rsquo; or &lsquo;pro-democratic&rsquo; intervention in various parts of the globe. In parallel, as a response to abuses committed during such operations and as a result of the calls for greater accountability by NGOs and civil society, domestic courts and international monitoring bodies have progressively provided greater scrutiny of the conduct of States engaged in military action abroad, an area traditionally thought to be mostly beyond the scope of judicial control. Over the past decade, domestic and international case law has progressively extended the scope of application of international human rights standards in order to ensure protection of individuals not taking part in the hostilities, combatants and &lsquo;enemy fighters&rsquo;, and, more recently, members of the armed forces vis-&agrave;-vis their national State.
The application of human rights standards in the context of armed conflict and related complex emergencies raises a number of challenging theoretical, moral and practical issues; the subject area is one of some complexity, located at the intersection of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, the jus ad bellum and United Nations law. It is an area which remains in a state of flux and is a particular target for strategic human rights litigation and advocacy activities by NGOs.
The module explores this increasingly important area of law and assesses the role and effectiveness of international human rights law instruments and mechanisms as instruments of protection in times of conflict. Part 1 of the module examines a range of &lsquo;threshold&rsquo; questions, including the applicability of human rights law in times of war; the relationship of human rights law with international humanitarian law and other branches of international law, and the extraterritorial applicability of human rights treaties, Part 2 then examines, through the medium of case studies, the way in which selected human rights are applicable during armed conflict, and the remedies available post-conflict in order to ensure justice and adequate reparation for the victims of violations.

  Our world has never been richer and has plenty of resources and technology to satisfy its whole population's basic needs. If equally distributed, the gross world product (GWP) of 2013 ($87.25 trillion) would allow for each world citizen more than $13,000 a year, that is, over 28 times the World Bank extreme poverty threshold of $1.25 a day. The reality however, is that more than a billion people are still below that threshold, almost half of the world population is below the higher poverty threshold of $2 a day, and more than 80% are below the vulnerability threshold of $10 a day. This is in great part due to the model of regulation of economic development adopted in most parts of the world, and in the global system as a whole, which, as argued recently by French economist Thomas Picketty in his celebrated book 'Capital in the 21st Century', sustains an extremely unequal distribution of income and wealth.
What are the moral and legal implications of this state of affairs, in particular from the perspective of development and the rule of law? Is development simply economic growth, as measured by GDP? Can inequality and development coexist? Are inequality and poverty a violation of human rights? Can the rule of law survive in a highly inegalitarian environment? What, if anything, can/should law (and lawyers) do to fight poverty and inequality? What is the role of global law firms and of an increasingly transnational legal profession in these border-crossing processes of economic development, institutional, financial and legal assistance?
This module focuses on the very concrete legal, economic, political as well as ethical challenges that lawyers face when working in this context. The materials studied in the course - cutting-edge development scholarship, policy papers, economic, sociological and political analysis and reports from NGOs and international organisations - will enable the practicing lawyer or legal advisor in international law and development to understand and approach intricate development issues from a solid theoretical and empirical perspective. The engagement with these complex materials will always occur with concrete legal problems and policy challenges in view, allowing for a highly practice-relevant study of international law and development "in context".
The module will also introduce students to the short but rich history of the field of 'law and development' since its origins in the 1960s. This historical background is crucial for an understanding of the challenges the field is facing today. The module starts with an introduction to the debates on the concept of poverty and inequality, their measurement and an analysis of the most recent data. It turns then to the idea of development and the current challenges to the narrow definition of development and growth as merely economic. Drawing on the work of some of the world's most renowned economists and law   development experts, we will discuss the concept of human development and the contested concept of human rights, with a particular focus on both political and socio-economic rights, such as political participation, the right to health, education, housing and an adequate standard of living. The course then turns to an investigation of the intricate and very vividly discussed relationship between the idea of the rule of law and development, in the light of persisting global inequality. The module aims to engage with this evolving debate and also investigate current transnational legal efforts, especially in the field of human rights advocacy and litigation, to fight poverty and inequality. Special attention will be given here to the growing expertise and insights fast emerging from developing countries themselves on the impact of development efforts, including the judicialization of politics in many countries, in particular Latin America, South Africa and Asia, in the field of socio-economic policy.

  In our increasingly globalized society family law is no longer an isolated field that simply represents the traditions and values of an individual culture. Transnational influences including human rights, regional norms and international scrutiny, have played a crucial role in opening family law to widening perspectives.
At the same time, individuals and families are moving across borders in a manner not seen in previous eras. As a result, cross-border disputes are coming to the attention of national and regional courts, and jurisdiction no longer solely rests in one easily definable location.
The first part of the course will take a comparative approach, and consider the ways in which different jurisdictions approach the regulation of adult relationships, the recognition of gender, and parenthood. This will give students the opportunity to study the principles and policies underlying family law, and the way in which legal ideas migrate from one jurisdiction to another.
The second part of the course will examine the resolution of family disputes that cross national borders, including parental child abduction, intercountry adoption, and reproductive technology and surrogacy. Students will analyse the interaction between international human rights law and private international law in regulating these practices, and consider whether it is possible to develop a uniform approach to these transnational practices.

Teaching is in seminar format, and students are expected to arrive prepared to participate actively in discussion in class. The reading lists for each of the classes include a section entitled &ldquo;issues for discussion&rdquo;, some of the questions in which will constitute the starting point for discussion in class. Students are strongly encouraged to give some preliminary thought to those questions in preparing for each seminar.
Discussion in class will generally proceed from the analysis of primary materials, with particular emphasis on international legal instruments (treaties, resolutions of international organizations, etc.) and the case law of the main human rights bodies (and, where relevant, domestic courts applying international standards).

  Module overview
The module surveys the  international legal framework for the protection of human rights. It aims to  provide students with a sound understanding of the global and regional institutions and mechanisms for the protection of human rights and  to equip them with the legal and analytical tools  necessary to interpret, critically assess and apply in practice the norms of international human rights law.
The module is directed primarily to those students interested in  pursuing a career in the field of international (or domestic) protection of human rights. As such, it is  of particular interest to those who plan to practice in the field of human rights and civil liberties, to engage in advocacy activities for  human rights NGOs, or to work for governmental agencies or international organizations.  The module is also suitable for those interested more generally in the functioning of the international regime for the protection of human rights and  those who intend to pursue an academic career.
The module is divided into two parts.  The first part focuses on the legal sources of international human rights law, the institutional framework for the protection of human rights and the practical functioning of the main international systems for the protection of human rights, i.e. the UN systems and th three regional systems (the European,  Inter-American and African systems). In the  second part, the focus shifts to the  in-depth analysis of selected human rights and 'hot topics' in contemporary human rights law, including the role of human rights in the context of  counter-terrorism,  military action and immigration control operations; the question of applicability of human rights obligations to extraterritorial State action; and the debate on cultural and religious diversity and the protection of fundamental rights.

  Module description
This module will cover both international law on the use of force (jus ad bellum) and international law governing the conduct of warfare (jus in bello). The jus ad bellum part will begin with an anlaysis of the prohibition on the use of force in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and will then proceed to examine the exceptions to the prohibition: those codified in the UN Charter (self-defence, collective security) and those which are not (e.g., humanitarian intervention).
We will review and assess the basic jus ad bellum doctrines, while also examining various armed conflicts in relation to which these doctrines have been applied and shaped. Throughout the module, you will be invited to think about jus ad bellum as a contested field in which different actors &ndash; legal advisers to foreign offices, military lawyers, international lawyers working for NGOs, legal scholars, activists and others &ndash;play a part.
In the jus in bello part of the course, you will become familiar with the relevant customary and treaty law, and engage in a critical analysis of judicial decisions and state practice. The issues that will be addressed include: the distinction between international and non-international armed conflict; the protection of civilians; the law of weaponry and the conduct of hostilities; the relationship between international human rights law and the jus in bello; the law of occupations; and questions of enforcement and implementation.
Throughout the course, current debates on the changing nature of warfare, with a focus on the extent to which they have informed the practice of state and non-state actors, will be considered.
Important note:
This module is offered in conjunction with the War Studies Department.  
There are a limited number of places available on this module. These are shared between students from The Dickson Poon School of Law and the War Studies Department.

  This course sets out to undertake a critical review of the evolving strategies for protection of the refugees under international, regional and domestic law, with particular reference to transnational legal decisions from across the world. It will examine the origins and evolution of refugee law, who is protected by international, regional and domestic refugee law, why the protection does not extend to wider groups of people (e.g. environmental refugees), and will assess the scope and limits of refugee rights. As wars rage in the Middle East and beyond, it will consider the various legal and policy impediments to asylum-seeking, who is admitted and who is not, and how transnational developments and initiatives can assist in the protection of forced migrants. Refugees are the leading trans-border issue in the world today. Yet, there is no world refugee court that can hand down authoritative decisions on refugees. All major human rights violations, such as human trafficking, religious affiliation and conscientious objection, sexual orientation and gay rights, sexual violence and female genital mutilation, and indiscriminate attacks against civilians in &lsquo;war zones&rsquo; &ndash; affect refugees and determine their numbers world-wide. Each of these issues requires transnational solutions and will be considered in this module.

  This one-year (40 credits) module will provide students with a foundation in law and society in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (&lsquo;China&rsquo;), as one of the most important, but also challenged and challenging, legal-political systems in the world today. Our objective is to facilitate, over the course of the academic year, a critical understanding of how law operates in Chinese society, and to prepare students for future engagement with Chinese law in various professional contexts. Specific topics to be addressed will include the role of law in Chinese history; the legacy of Mao Zedong and legal reform in the post-Mao era; central aspects of the judicial process, dispute resolution systems and access to justice; the basic principles of private, commercial and administrative law; central issues in criminal justice; the role of civil society and human rights advocacy; and transnational aspects of rule of law development in China. A central claim underlying the design of this module is that these topics should be studied in their entirety and in context.

  Since 9/11 there has been an 'amazing downloading' of international law in the form of Security Council resolutions into domestic jurisdictions. This has fundamental consequences not only for constitutional law and civil liberties, but also how the private sector functions. Aside from sanctions, actions under the auspices of the UN Office of Drugs and Crime on, for example; corruption, human trafficking, piracy, and wildlife and forest crime also have an increasing impact on domestic and transnational operations, as have the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the 'Ruggie Principles'). This module examines this UN interaction with other legal systems, in particular the EU and the UK, and private actors.
The first part of the course will acquaint students with the legal foundations of the United Nations - its origins, conceptual and institutional structure and competence, and familiarize them with the evolving practice at the UN. It will also address some of the current and enduring challenges facing the UN system, contrasting theory with practice, including the growing role of NGOs in the work of the UN.
The second part of the course will explore how the UN interacts with other legal systems, individuals and the private business sector through UN Security Council sanctions, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and initiatives such as the Ruggie Principles, examining the conflicts and interactions that result. As well as the human rights and constitutional aspects, we will look at what the growth in international governance measures under UN auspices means for domestic and transnational commercial entities, commercial law, corporate responsibility for the actions of subsidiaries in other jurisdictions implicated in human rights and other violations of international law and, more broadly, the growing role of the private sector in the implementation of international law.
The intention of the course is to bring together themes that are often examined in separate courses. The learning objective is that students would come away with an understanding of the United Nations, public international law and the interaction between legal systems, as well as a practical understanding of the law from the perspective of a transnational practice and the commercial sector (banks, insurers, shippers etc). It is designed to appeal both to students who want to develop their theoretical understanding of international law and those who plan to move into private practice; all the tutors involved have a background in both practice and academia. The module is also suited for those taking the European Law and International Business Law LLM pathways.

  Transnational legal studies map the emergence of new forms of law aimed at addressing a range of complex socio-economic and political trans-border problems. These problems have emerged against the backdrop of shifts in nation states&rsquo; regulatory governance patterns wherein non-state actors play a crucial role by articulating social norms, policies and processes leading to the production of a densely plural legal field of which formal state law is only one, albeit significant, element. Socio-legal scholars engaged in the study of sociology of law, legal pluralism and legal cultures have long been preoccupied with the study of these aspects of the law within the domestic context. To elaborate, the sociology of law is the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as embedded in society. Sociologists of law empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors. Increasingly, sociologists of law also understand law sociologically so that they are not merely preoccupied with the study of law and society but of law in society. Areas of socio-legal inquiry include legal pluralism, the social development of legal institutions, forms of social control, legal regulation, the interaction between legal cultures, the social construction of legal issues, the 'law in the books' and the 'law in action', the legal profession, and the relation between law and social change.

  The module addresses the challenges that have long been arising for national governments and international organizations in effectively regulating border-crossing activities. Taking a historical as well as conceptual perspective on both legitimate and criminal activities, we will study key areas of transnational networks and regimes in order to identify the scope as well as the limits of law in governing private transnational actors. By looking at examples of global networks drawn from the present and the past, e.g. diamond traders, merchants of the Northern Mediterranean Sea, mafias, and pirates in the early 18th century, it will become apparent how a traditional, state-based 'top-down' approach in legal regulation often proves insufficient.
The core reason for taking this historical-conceptual view is to critically investigate an ever faster developing reality of transnational private regulatory activity, ranging from food security to technical standards, from credit ratings to poverty levels, or from minimum capital requirements to educational standards. In view of the persisting 'democracy deficit' on the global level in such a wide range of hotly contested and sensitive regulatory areas, lawyers need to develop a better understanding of how transnational regimes operate, regulate and govern. For each of these global networks, the students will be asked to focus on the nature and content of the norms developed within these networks, as well as the processes through which these norms are enforced at a transnational level.

  In a world which is dominated by global trading and free movement of capital and investment it is very likely that insolvency proceedings will not be hermetically contained in a single jurisdiction. Large multinational companies will often conduct business via a multitude of subsidiaries and branches in a number of different jurisdictions worldwide. Thousands of shareholders and debt investors may be scattered around the world. Even small and medium sized companies may have had dealings with parties from other countries, or may own or have interests in property which is located in different jurisdictions. Liabilities may be owed to parties domiciled in a different country from that of the debtor; or the relevant obligations may be governed by foreign law; or may be due to be performed abroad. These situations give rise to complex issues in respect of conflict-of-laws as well as the substantive law of insolvency and reorganisation.
The module is set against this background. In the first part of the module important issues of substantive corporate insolvency law will be analysed on a functional and comparative basis, taking into account the laws of major Western economies (US, UK, Germany, France). Over the last decade the three European jurisdictions under consideration have substantially reformed their insolvency laws (Germany in 1999, UK in 2002, France in 2005 and again in 2008/09). Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code has in many respects influenced these reforms and facilitated the rise of the rescue culture in Europe. Accordingly, particular emphasis will be put on the law of corporate reorganisation inside as well as outside formal proceedings (workouts). Despite this remarkable trans-Atlantic convergence, substantial differences remain, not least resulting from the interaction of corporate insolvency law with other areas of law such as company law, contract law and property law. We will trace these differences and try to explain them in the light of their social and economic contexts.
In the second part, the module will focus on the national and international instruments dealing with the conflict-of-laws issues in transnational corporate insolvency and reorganisation: the European Insolvency Regulation, the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, it implementation in the UK and the US, as well as Domestic Jurisdiction in the United States. The issues of jurisdiction, recognition of foreign proceedings, judicial cooperation in concurrent proceedings and the applicable law pursuant to these instruments will be studied, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective.

  Criminal law is no longer confined to dealing with crime within national borders. Genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression carry individual responsibility under international law. Crimes such as human trafficking, piracy, drug trafficking and terrorism have cross-border effects leading to legal responses at regional and international levels. As a result domestic criminal law must increasingly take account of both international (state-to-state) and transnational (states-and-private-actors) responses to criminal activity. This module provides an in-depth understanding of international and transnational criminal law from institutional, substantive and comparative perspectives.

  In this module, we will focus on the structures and rules of transnational arbitration, particularly on their authorship, their implementation and revision. As we examine the differences between transnational arbitration rules and existing international as well as domestic norms, it will become apparent how private actors (including transnational businesses, arbitrators, or arbitral institutions) assume the role of transnational rule creators, policy makers and conflict resolvers. This transnationalization of dispute resolution can be shown to be part of a much larger trend of domestic law&rsquo;s transformation through privatization and delegation, while, at the same time, contributing to an ever more complex realm of global governance.
The first session will lay out the theoretical foundations for the group and present the type of research and debates that students will engage into during the module. During the four following sessions of the module, each student will be asked to write and present a short (1-2 pages long) reaction paper to scholarly works in the field of arbitration. These scholarly works will focus on the four following topics:
General Theory of Arbitration
Authority and Global Architecture
Procedure
Precedent and Appeal
Students will devote the second half of the term to the drafting of a research paper (6000 words +/- 500 words). The subject of the research paper will relate to one of the four topics set out above. Students will meet individually with the instructor to discuss their topic and ongoing research during the second half of the term. The instructor will also assist those of the students who wish to engage into archival work.
During the last session of the term, the class will meet again so that each student presents orally his/her ongoing research (in approximately 10 minutes). The final research paper will be due at the end of the exam period.

  With the globalization of corporate activity, capital movement and foreign direct investment, corporate governance has become a border-crossing concern and a contested field of debate on a global scale. At the same time, corporate governance rules and principles are increasingly being created and disseminated through a complex mixture of public, private, state and non-state based norm-making processes that involve different domestic, international and transnational actors. This module will study this fast-evolving regulatory landscape and provide students with a deeper understanding not only of the rules themselves but of the transnational political and economic conditions under which they are developing.
In the first part, the module will address different concepts of the corporation and of corporate governance from both a contemporary and historical perspective. The second part of the module will provide for a series of detailed studies of pressing issues in corporate governance regulation today by looking at both the 'hard' and the 'soft' law in these areas, including takeovers, hedge funds governance, rating agencies and corporate board composition.
The module exposes students to a variety of domestic, comparative and transnational bodies of law and norms and to a selection of cross-disciplinary debates that address the changing roles of corporate actors in a globalizing world. It is suitable for students interested in the transnationalization of corporate governance from both a practice perspective and a focus on the wider debates surrounding this lively regulatory field today.

  Transnational law enforcement is vital to the study of contemporary legal theory and practice because it concerns the everyday attempts by police and other agents to solve problems that transcend or transgress national boundaries. The rapid growth of global policing and transnational law enforcement reflects a shift in the nature of governance under conditions of globalisation. Transnational law enforcement is now a policy response to organised crime, terrorism, migration and people trafficking, financial crime, environmental crime, intellectual property theft, competition law violations, cybercrime and many other transnational legal problems. The study of policing and law enforcement practices that transcend national boundaries is a vibrant interdisciplinary field that links law with criminology, sociology, philosophy, political science and international relations. This module sets out a comprehensive analysis of the architecture and practices of law enforcement agents working above and beyond the nation-state (including the use of force, surveillance, intelligence gathering, joint investigation, mutual legal assistance, cross-border evidence collection, fugitive apprehension and rendition). The module concludes by asking how and to whom transnational law enforcement can be held accountable.
The module includes presentations from the module leader (drawing on his text Global Policing
 (Sage 2012)), student-led exposition of essential articles, plenary discussion of key issues and student-led case studies of specific law enforcement problems that interest them. The module is focused on developing students' understanding of transnational law enforcement, applying their analytical skills to multi-jurisdictional policing problems and drafting research papers. The module will be valuable to students aiming for careers in research, policy or practice in international organizations requiring a high level of analytical and writing ability and for those seeking to progress to a PhD.

  Practicing lawyers are often confronted with the limitations of having to rely on precedent or legislation when advising clients in areas of &lsquo;new&rsquo; law, or where court decisions and statutory regulations are not yet sufficiently available. While this might be due to the fact that the law &ndash; in a domestic setting &ndash; is only slowly awakening to a recently emerged regulatory problem, this governance lag is amplified in the context of transnational activities, where issues of sovereignty, jurisdiction and forum pose additional obstacles to the creation of effective legal regulation. Practically speaking, lawyers in such cases frequently resort to team work, experts, stakeholders and other relevant parties &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo;, eventually shifting their strategy from litigation to a combination of legal consultancy, advocacy, coalition building and even public awareness building. This type of lawyering requires considerable flexibility, competences and resources, which are not readily available to every lawyer. From a theoretical perspective, the lawyer might find herself overwhelmed by what can be the technical or cognitive as well as the moral complexity of the case setting she is working on.
At the centre of the module is the shift away from training lawyers in learning and interpreting the law primarily through the study of jurisprudence (case law as in the common law tradition) or through the interpretation of statutory law (legislation &ndash; civil law tradition). Instead, students are invited to take on the perspective of the lawyer/advocate/activist who is involved in &lsquo;building&rsquo; a case from a set of diverse, inchoate and constantly evolving facts and data. This reversal of perspective is a crucial element in confronting students as future practitioners with the real-world challenges of an effective access to justice.
Assuming the position of legal practice and rights advocacy, students immerse themselves into a case from the &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; by identifying and negotiating the affected and involved interests, finding and navigating the applicable law, including, possibly, 'soft' law, codes of conduct, social norms etcetera, and developing a legal interest representation strategy (&ldquo;LIRS&rdquo;). In contrast to giving legal advice to a client in a more or less confined and concrete legal question regarding, for example; liability, entitlement, conviction or acquittal, the development of a LIRS might include a variety of avenues, including, but not limited to, designing a litigation or defence strategy, the enhancing of legal and political rights, engaging in coalition and public awareness building or contributing to a sustainable stakeholder interest representation process.
