  Drawing on theories and perspectives of social science, and configuration and practices of healthcare services, this module aims to provide students with a critical understanding of the challenges faced by ageing populations in maintaining health and wellbeing across the adult lifecourse. The module will emphasise the influence of a rapidly changing social context on older people&rsquo;s experience of health, and society&rsquo;s management of health and illness in ageing populations.
   
On successful completion of this module, students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of:
1. Social science approaches to the study of identity, personality, nature of personal relationships and social (dis)advantage of ageing.
2. The contributions of ageing, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic and physical factors, to health and illness in later life.
3. How individuals and families respond to health and illness in older adults, including formal and informal care.
4. Societal responses to health and illness in later life through health policy development, healthcare services and legislative means.
5. The changing context of life for older people and the possible effect of this on their health and wellbeing.
