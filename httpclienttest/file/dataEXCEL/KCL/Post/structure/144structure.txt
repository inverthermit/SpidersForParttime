   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Study groups are small and there is a high level of personal attention. Teaching formats include academic seminars, small group reading seminars, application to practice seminars, individual and professional development groups, clinical practice groups and individual/clinical placements. 
Assessment is through written assignments, examination and ongoing formative assessment of practice. Lectures and discussions form the core teaching for each module. They cover the main topics and key themes in the curriculum of each module, and ideas are developed further in small group work, case analyses and student presentations. You are expected to supplement class work and lecture notes with further reading. As well as recommended references, which are linked to each weeks' sessions, independent literature searches will extend your knowledge and understanding. 
During the first term there will be a library induction and a workshop on literature searching. Because much of the learning and teaching takes place in groups of no more than twenty students, sessions are typically interactive and student contributions are encouraged. As part of the programme assessment process, students will be required to submit coursework (e.g. essays) and/or sit examinations in each module. The staff team seeks to provide a supportive environment which will allow participants to develop their knowledge and clinical skills. Each student is assigned a personal and academic tutor to support them in their studies.
