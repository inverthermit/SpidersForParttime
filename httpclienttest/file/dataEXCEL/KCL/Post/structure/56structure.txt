  This MA module will provide an in-depth study of the influences  shaping the multiple images and narrative traditions of Alexander the  Great, as well as key phases of his reception and redefinition in later  cultures. The popular history of Alexander in folklore,  literature, art and film will be considered on an equal footing with the  development of ancient and modern historiography. In addition, the  course highlights his cultural significance in both the Western  Christian and Eastern Arabic and Persian-speaking worlds and examines  its implications. Discussion and coursework directions can follow  ongoing themes, which bridge the weekly topics, such as Alexander and  India, imperialist and kingship ideologies, ethnic and national  appropriations and narratology.

  Aphrodite's island lies at the crossroads of the eastern Mediterranean  Sea.  Rich in natural resources and strategically located, Cyprus has  long benefited from contact with surrounding cultures: the Levant to the  east, Egypt to the south, Anatolia to the north and the Aegean to the  west.  These interactions played a crucial role in the formation of a  distinctive, prosperous and fascinating island culture during the  prehistoric and early historic periods (c. 7,000-325 BC).

  This module investigates the impact of the Roman empire on the  societies, cultures and economies of the western Mediterranean (Italy,  Spain, North Africa) and north-west Europe (Gaul and Germany) from the  first century BC to fourth century AD. It introduces and explores  archaeological evidence, both monuments and material culture and, where  appropriate, documentary, sources (an ability to read ancient languages  is not required). After considering the process of conquest, the  creation of provinces and frontiers, it studies different facets of  provincial communities, including cities and other settlements,  landscapes and agriculture, religious practice and burial rites,  cuisine, dress and bodily decoration. It also assesses the impact on  provincial life of barbarian invasion and political instability in the  late Roman period. Critical traditions in the archaeology of the Roman  world are also reviewed.
  
    Attacking the Theatre in the European Theatrical Tradition (focusing on Graeco-Roman antiquity, England and France) - Optional

  This is a research-led module aiming to follow the anti-theatrical thread in  European literature (including theatre itself) and culture from the  Greek dramatic texts to the aesthetic and performative explorations of  the twentieth century. Major stops/themes include: Greek drama; Plato;  the anti-pantomime discourses of imperial and late antiquity; Christians  against the theatre in imperial and late antiquity; the infamia of  professional actors in Roman society (and possible reverberations of  anti-theatrical tendencies in Roman Comedy); English Renaissance Drama  and Renaissance theatrical polemic; the social status of actors in  eighteenth-century France and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Lettre &agrave;  Monsieur D'Alembert sur les spectacles; the ferocious attacks on  popular entertainment in eighteenth-century London; the alleged cultural  degeneration associated with Italian opera in eighteenth-century  London; the suspicion of the stage and the actors as reflected in the  nineteenth-century English novel (e.g. Jane Austen's Mansfield Park);  the furore against gender-bending opera singers (castrati) and male  ballerinos in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the revolutionary  aesthetic and theatre practice of Bertolt Brecht. Part of the  intellectual challenge offered by this module arises from the detection  of recurrent patterns, concerns and anxieties across geographical,  chronological and cultural borders.

  All students will require the course text book: M. Balme   G. Lawall, Athenaze I and II (OUP revised edition 1995 &ndash; UK edition). As we will be working towards completing Athenaze I by Christmas, and Athenaze II by Easter, we will be aiming to cover about one chapter per class.
You should therefore expect to devote 8-10 hours a week to independent study: preparing extensively for each class; memorising vocabulary and grammar; doing exercises on paper and online, as directed.

  The aim of the course is to introduce students to the issues raised by  the development of a new literary genre, hagiography, from the fourth  century. As well as looking at the wider issues, and reading a  considerable number of texts in translation, they will also be expected  to analyse the language and content of a specific text (in Greek). In  the course of the investigation students will be asked to question  assumptions about literary genre, about sources of sanctity, and about  textual analysis. They will also need to consider and develop the skills  necessary to present material of this kind.

  The module offers the opportunity to acquire a deep knowledge of the evolution, artistic production and monumental heritage of a part of the medieval world that exemplifies developments beyond Constantinople and has generated a lot of recent and incisive scholarship.
The subject matter is approached (i) as a case study of a Byzantine province, looking at its fate in the 'dark age' and medieval period, and (ii) as a prime example of western expansion into the eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the Crusades and later in the context of Venice's commercial empire. The island's history illustrates several important themes in the evolution of the Mediterranean and consequently its artistic and monumental heritage encapsulate and exemplify the principal wider trends (the centrality of Byzantine culture, the introduction of Gothic architecture, the genesis of Crusader art, the impact of the Renaissance). Thus one of the overarching themes is the wider context (Byzantine and/or Crusader, Levantine and/or Mediterranean) which will loom large over the investigation of each topic.

  This is a research-led module aiming to follow the pro-theatrical voice as heard  in European literature (including theatre itself) and culture from the  Greek dramatic texts to the aesthetic and performative explorations of  the twentieth century. Major stops/themes will include: Greek drama; the  pro-pantomime and mime discourses of imperial and late antiquity  (Lucian, Libanius, Choricius); Roman Comedy; English Renaissance Drama  and Elizabethan defences of the stage; Pierre Corneille's masterpiece L'Illusion  Comique, an exuberant defence of actors and the stage; Diderot's  famous Paradox of Acting, legendary eighteenth-century tragic actors and  the beginnings of a "science" of acting in France; the seminal  importance of Lucian's apologetic On the Dance (second century AD) for  eighteenth-century dance defences and the birth of the "ballet  d'action", a precursor of the classical/romantic ballet; David Garrick's  acting "revolution" and the emancipation of acting as a liberal art;  twentieth-century explorations in search of "truth" and "self-knowledge"  in theatre and acting. Part of the intellectual challenge offered by  this module arises from the detection of recurrent patterns in the  struggle to legitimate theatre and acting/dancing across geographical,  chronological and cultural borders.

  This unique course offers a year of training in Greek epigraphy, taught  by experts on all periods, from the archaic to the late Roman: it is  taught by scholars from three colleges, King's, Royal Holloway and UCL, and is offered at each college. It is  offered in close collaboration with the British Museum, and exploits  their collection. The aim is to give students both a training in the  practical techniques of epigraphy, experience in dealing with  inscriptions and their context, and also practice in the analysis and  use of inscribed texts in the study of the Greek-speaking world.  The  course is designed with an extensive chronological range from the  earliest inscriptions of the 8th century BC to the last phases of the  significant use of inscriptions in civic life, in the 6th century AD.

  This module studies the development of pottery, vase-painting and other  forms of painting in Greece from Geometric to South Italian. While the  course is primarily art-historical, subjects to be covered include  technique, iconography and myth, and the importance of pottery as an  indicator of date, social customs and workshop practice, and the  relationship of pottery to sculpture and literature. Consideration will  also be given to connoisseurship and varying approaches to the subject.  The evidence for lost wall-painting will be assessed. Much use will be  made of the collections of the
British Museum.

  Greek poetry of the third century BC renaissance is both absorbing and  fascinating in itself, and of huge historical signficance for its  influence on Roman poetry of the late Republican and Augustan periods,  and thus on European literature more broadly. This course offers an  intensive study of key poems by three major poets fo the period -  Callimachus, Theocritus and Apollonius of Rhodes - including both  complete and fragmentary works, and epigram as well as large-scale  compositions. Class time will be devoted to a combination of close  reading of texts in the original Greek and discussion of larger issues  of interpretation, bearing both on the individual poets, and the  cultural environment in which they worked.

  This dedicated MA module aims to introduce Horace as a lyric poet. In  his first book Horace offered the reader an exceptional variety of lyric  forms and themes (hymns, narratives, erotic, sympotic, and political  situations). In addition to seeing how Horace adapted the rich tradition  of Greek lyric (and epigram) for Latin lyric, we will particularly  concentrate on his poetic style, since one of the issues he faced was  the creation of a satisfactory verbal medium for lyric, which had only a  slight tradition in Rome. Close attention will therefore be paid to  diction, word order and sentence structure. The organization of the  individual ode, and the ordering of the poems within the book will also  be studied.

  A course for students who have completed a beginners' course in Greek, designed to extend their knowledge of the language to the point where they are ready to read substantial texts.
Students should expect to devote 8-10 hours a week to independent study.
All students are required to attend all classes, and to prepare for those classes. This requires grammatical exercises, including some translation from English into Greek, as well as preparing to translate passages from Greek, and also some background reading. In Semester 2, or as soon as the class is ready, there will be a more extensive focus on the translation and interpretation of texts.

  The course provides an introduction to the varied physical remains of all types left behind by Byzantine civilization: architecture, painting, the so-called minor arts, and manufactured objects. The selection of material and issues to be examined range from the urban and rural landscapes, fortifications, palaces, houses, monasteries and churches, to mosaics, frescoes, sculpture, enamels, ivories, reliquaries, lead seals and pottery as well as traded goods. This wide range of topics will be investigated chronologically as well as thematically from a primarily functional and practical point of view, in order to trace and highlight the changes that occurred over the centuries, signaling different stages in the millennial existence of Byzantium. Each subject will be approached on the basis of case studies that exemplify the nature and problems of the evidence.

  Much attention has been devoted in recent years to the construction of 'imagined communities', modern Greece since 1821 being a paradigmatic case. This module (which complements 7AABM111 Perceptions of the past) seeks to explore how such constructions emerge and are then canonized through the poetic tradition, in a country in which poetry has been especially prized, not least for its susceptibility to being read in national (and indeed in nationalist) terms. Covering a representative range of major poets since the initial rising against the Ottomans up to the declaration of war by Greece in 1940, this module seeks to encourage students to interrogate (but not necessarily to disavow) connections between the poetic tradition and the mental map which it constructs of significant, even sacred, places in the modern national memory. Within that memory, the ancient, Byzantine and Revolutionary pasts each have a salience which derives as much from poetry as it does from history &ndash; and the aim of the module is help students to explore the relation between the two, on the basis of texts to be studies either in the Greek original or in translation.

  This module uses the extensive archaeological and epigraphic remains from Pompeii and Herculaneum to provide an in-depth understanding of a wide range of historical issues that include urban development and local politics, social structures and relations, economy and production, public and private art and architecture, the Roman family, culture and literacy, gender and sexuality, and health and nutrition. In addition, the module explores the reception of the Vesuvian cities, tracing their impact on contemporary western culture from the 18th century until the present day. The module involves the discussion of ancient sources in Latin.

  The module is a case study in Roman Imperialism and introduction to the  material culture of the Roman empire. It covers the conquest of Britain,  its transformation into a Roman province, later changes in its  administration and defence, and the impact of incorporation into the  Roman empire on the physical environment, religion, economy and society  of Britain. The module develops students' ability to understand and  use archaeological evidence of all types, and Latin epigraphic sources,  for historical reconstruction of processes of social and economic  change; the problem of using concepts such as 'Romanisation' is  constantly confronted.

  The module provides an introduction to some of the disciplines,  methodologies, problems and themes that may be encountered by those  undertaking research work in the field of ancient history. The topics  covered range from papyrology, numismatics and archaeology to general  issues of method in ancient history. The objective is that students  beginning research should be equipped with the knowledge, skills and  bibliography that will enable them to develop a research project and  pursue it successfully. Seminars are given by staff with personal  research interests in the topics discussed. This is the core module for  the MA in Ancient History.

  Through a close reading of Tacitus, Annals 13-16, the course  combines historical study of the reign of Nero with literary study of  Tacitus. Tacitus' language and style are analysed in the context of  their creation of a particular portrait of Nero. Tacitus' presentation  of the key episodes and issues in Nero's reign is examined and compared  with other accounts and evidence to assess the historicity of the  Tacitean image of Nero.

  This module studies how the peoples of the ancient Greek world defined  themselves in terms of their origin, in the senses of both birth and  place. The purpose of the course is to investigate multiple layers of  social content embedded in the term 'ancient Greeks'. Engaging with this  broad concept, the students learn to expose and explore the patchwork  of many civic and territorial identities that underlie the overarching  concept of 'the Greeks': regional, ethnic, polis, tribal (also defined  by affiliation to kin-groups), and demotic identities.

  British School at Rome Annual Postgraduate Course
This course is designed to develop postgraduate students' research  skills in the study of ancient Rome. It examines the city as a whole -  the topography, development and function of the Imperial capital - and  analyses selected monuments in terms of their structural history, their  architectural characteristics, their place in the development of the  urban plan, their social, economic or religious function and their  subsequent use and influence.

  The reign of Constantine I (306-337) marks a dramatic period of change  in the Mediterranean world. Constantine legalised and favoured the  Christian church; he adopted the city of Byzantium as his new capital of  Constantinople. Both of these moves would come to be seen as  determining the course of the following centuries. This reign has  therefore been the subject of constant assessment and reassessment. In  this course we will look at contemporary descriptions of Constantine; at  the emperor's own words; and at other evidence for his activities. We  will also look at later interpretations of the reign. In  learning about this crucial period, students will be expected to develop  their critical skills, and their own independent analysis, in looking  at conflicting evidence, much of which is highly opinionated.

  We will be reading extracts from the whole of Virgil's work, concentrating on the Aeneid, but beginning with the Eclogues and Georgics. Students will be expected to read 300-400 lines of Latin per week, together with one or two articles or chapters from books. The purpose of the class is to acquire an understanding of the shape and character of Virgil's oeuvre, of the main critical issues it raises and of the nature of Virgil's style. The final weeks of the Lent term will be devoted to aspects of the reception of Virgil, according to student interest.
