  Module description
This module considers taxation in an international context. Domestic tax systems have increasingly had to respond to globalisation so that taxation can still be viable in an environment where activities which have traditionally attracted taxation can be carried out without domestic borders to define their scope. The module will consider taxation and international law in general and then move on to looking at the ways in which domestic systems have sought to deal with double taxation where activities attracting taxation are carried out over more than one country &ndash; namely through double taxation conventions. The focus will be on the OECD Model and double taxation conventions based on this and why international business gives tax systems a problem and how this can be addressed.

  Taxation is a key factor in business decisions, and how to raise tax from businesses without damaging the economy is a central element in all government&rsquo;s policy.
In this module we will examine the taxation of businesses under UK income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. We will also consider, to a lesser extent, VAT, the UK interaction with foreign taxes, and stamp duty.
Although it is based around the UK tax system, the module deals with questions about the taxation of businesses that face all tax systems. Its object is to provide a solid grounding in the principles of the taxation of businesses, and the main rules will be studied in depth in the context of those principles.

Transfer pricing is the single biggest issue in international taxation for multinational business and tax administrations. The aim of this module is to critically and comprehensively analyse the legal issues pertaining to Transfer Pricing and is addressed to lawyers, accountants and tax policy-makers, whether in private practice, as in-house counsel, or government employees. The course takes a practical, transactional and multi-jurisdictional perspective and examines in depth the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines including the rules and Commentary of the OECD Model Tax Convention together with a detailed analysis of transfer pricing disputes and practice including the expanding body of case law.

  Value Added Tax is an increasingly important tax in the UK and throughout the EU. Not only does it generate a large amount of revenue for governments, its character as a European tax makes for interesting case law and controversy within domestic systems.
This module considers the nature of VAT as a tax and considers the system of VAT as implemented in the UK. It considers the various elements of the tax and how the tax has developed in response to EU movement and pressure.
As well as gaining a comprehensive understanding of VAT in the UK, the aim of the module is to provide you with the tools to be able to comprehend other systems of VAT in Europe and also to understand why what seems like a simple tax has proved so complicated in the EU.
