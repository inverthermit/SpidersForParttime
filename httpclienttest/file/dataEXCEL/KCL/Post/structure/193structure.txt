  The process of globalisation has rendered the practice and study of corporate law increasingly international. This module, as a natural progression from the prerequisite module &ldquo;Comparative Corporate Law&rdquo;, aims at providing students with a better understanding of the approaches taken by different jurisdictions in a range of corporate law topics and at enhancing their research skills. Topics to be covered will vary from year to year to reflect the most recent research, but will generally include corporate theories; board structures; conflicts of interest between managers, shareholders, and other stakeholders; shareholder actions; control transactions; intermediaries and shareholder voting; and law and finance. Students are expected to research selected areas of comparative corporate law and through readings, class presentations and essay writings they will improve their understanding and awareness of domestic and comparative corporate law.

  In recent years, almost all aspects of corporate law have become increasingly international and globalised. An understanding of the approaches taken by different jurisdictions to resolving fundamental challenges faced by companies is therefore highly instructive. This course examines a selection of corporate law topics in a comparative context. The law of the United Kingdom will be used as a point of reference for the discussion of some topics, while particular emphasis will be put on the laws of continental Europe (in particular, Germany) and the United States (in particular, Delaware). 
The approach taken is both functional and comparative, looking at a series of core problems with which any system of corporate law must deal, and analysing, from a functional perspective, the solutions adopted by the systems in question. Topics include: theory of comparative corporate law and economic analysis of law; comparative corporate governance theories; board structures; directors&rsquo; remuneration; shareholder rights; shareholder activism; control transactions; investor protection; convergence or divergence debate.

  This module explores the new financial regulatory architecture of the European Union and its economic governance. This is an area, in which the EU has only recently asserted more centralised control, mainly due to the financial problems of financial institutions and Member States following the recent financial crisis. The course will discuss the evolution of financial harmonisation law in the Union, the new institutional architecture of the European Supervisory Authorities, as well as the regulatory and enforcement tools at their disposal. 
In addition, the module will discuss the efforts of the European Union to strengthen its economic governance, in particular within the Eurozone. It will analyse the regulatory arrangements and institutional structures within and outside EU law (Banking Union, European Financial Compact, European Stability Mechanism). Students will discuss the constitutional constraints of the system, its practical operation, and the policy choices and challenges behind the new regulatory regime.
This module is of considerable practical relevance to practising lawyers in the financial services industry, but also for those who are interested in the constitutional and administrative law problems which the new regulatory regime raises.

  Module description
This is the foundation module in financial risk and financial regulation. It explains what modern commercial banks and investment banks do, what products and services they develop and offer (now usually at the international level), what risks they take, what the legal and regulatory concerns are in terms of their operations, risk management and client protection, and how modern law and regulation attempt to deal with these matters.
The further subject is the operation of the modern financial markets in bonds, equities and derivatives, the manner in which these investments are now issued, traded and held; the trading, custody, clearing and settlement of these financial products; and the modern legal frameworks that operate in this connection and the regulatory principles that apply.
Finally the principle issues and concerns in investment management will be discussed as well as the regulatory regime concerning this activity.
This is module is practical as well as conceptual. You do not need prior knowledge in the field of modern finance.

It deals with equity financing &ndash; the law that regulates its raising, maintenance and pay&ndash;outs from the corporate treasury, and with debt financing &ndash; forms of debt finance and security interests. It concludes by examining three major kinds of financial transactions that companies get involved in: secondary issues, debt equity swaps and private equity transactions.

  Accountants, investment bankers and transactional lawyers are the three professional advisors that play significant roles in M A transactions, which are increasingly becoming established features of most advanced capitalist systems.
This module focuses on the routes by which outcomes (the takeover or merger) are structured and it provides a comprehensive examination of how the conduct of these transactions is regulated in the UK, especially in light of the implementation of the Takeovers Directive on 20 May 2006. It will entail the exposition of the Takeover Code&rsquo;s General Principles and Rules through cases decided by the Takeover Panel, in addition to relevant judicial authorities. The study of this jurisprudence will be a major theme of the module, whilst providing a strong theoretical underpinning to the subject.
Although the emphasis will be on regulation under Takeover Code (from which the European Directive draws many of its provisions) the module will also, in appropriate areas, consider different approaches to the subject under Federal and State regulation in the United States.

  This module is set against the background of the internationalisation of the flow of goods, services and capital. It studies the private law response to this development and the emergence of trans-national commercial and financial law as a new lex mercatoria to support these flows. In this context, the creation of a new legal order is discussed and the spontaneous development of an independent international normativity in it, the sources of law that become relevant in this connection and the hierarchy amongst them.
The function and approaches of official or unofficial international bodies in the formulation of industry practices, like the ICC in the Incoterms and UCP, of Unidroit and Uncitral in the formulation of uniform law like for the international sale of goods and receivable financing, or of groups of academics in the formulation of principles, like those of contract and trust law, will also be discussed. Their findings will be compared with those adopted in the US, especially in the Uniform Commercial Code.
At the academic level, this module will study the operation of the major legal systems, especially those of Common and Civil Law. At the practical level, it will consider the details especially of the modern laws of contract, sales, agency, payments, personal property, trusts, secured transactions, conditional sales, financial leases, repurchase agreements, factoring, securitizations and financial derivatives including swaps.
