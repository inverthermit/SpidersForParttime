  &bull; This module examines the social organisation of psychiatry as an apparatus for defining and regulating &lsquo;madness&rsquo; - and sanity.
&bull; We consider contemporary western psychiatric conceptions of mental illness and their critics, and use historical investigations to explore the complex links between psychiatric theories and practices and the emergence of &lsquo;modern&rsquo; societies.
&bull; We consider the birth of the asylum system in the nineteenth century and its relation to the development of modern, urban and industrial forms of life and cultural norms of conduct.
&bull; We explore &lsquo;colonial&rsquo; psychiatry, and its role in the management of conduct in the colonies. We examine the transformation of the psychiatric system in the first half of the twentieth century, with the discovery of &lsquo;the neuroses&rsquo; and a &lsquo;psychiatrisation of everyday life&rsquo;.
&bull; We analyse further major changes in psychiatry over the last twenty five years: the moves towards &lsquo;community psychiatry&rsquo; and the management of risk; the rise of biological explanations and treatments of mental disorder; the transnational spread of psychiatric medications such as tranquillisers and antidepressants.
&bull; We explore the globalization of psychiatry, considering both the rise of &lsquo;transcultural&rsquo; psychiatry, and the recent scholarship on the spread of &lsquo;western&rsquo; categories and practices to other societies and cultures.
&bull; Throughout the module, our focus will be on the relations of knowledge, power and expertise in psychiatry in different cultures, upon the ways in which psychiatry has operated as a means of social regulation, and upon the role of psychiatry in the cultural construction of normality and abnormality.

  This course is aimed at thinking broadly about the experiences and meanings of science and technology for the global population during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will focus on key themes in twentieth century global history: public health, race, global trade, decolonisation, modernisation, the nuclear age, green revolution and population control. We want to understand the normative and moral aspects of the debates and arguments around the "civilizing mission" under European colonialism through "modernization" during the Cold War under the global leadership of the United States and the Soviet Union, and how this transition of world politics was played out globally with respect to science and technology. We will see that interactions between cultures have often been negotiated through practices concerning the control and regulation of territories and populations. The ideas around civilisation and progress that helped legitimate these practices under colonial rule, continued through the period after World War II, providing the foundations for efforts to develop and modernise the emerging decolonised world. Through close attention to ideas and processes (more than on details of specific cases), we will examine the diversity of the historical actors and the context of their interactions.

  This module enables students to understand social science perspectives on the contemporary bioeconomy. Spanning both industrialised nations and the emerging economies of Asia Pacific, it will explore how the biomedical research enterprise is being reshaped by governments and corporations as they search for competitive advantage in an increasingly global bioeconomy.
The module is interdisciplinary drawing inter alia on science and technology studies, socio-legal studies and political economy. Topics covered will include: the emergence of the idea of a knowledge-based economy, and its function as part of the neoliberal state project (the shift from government to governance); the concept of promissory science and the promotion of biotechnology as a &lsquo;frontier technology&rsquo;; the formation of public policy through processes of multi-level governance at the local, national and transnational levels; the intersection between public policy and commercial strategy, and the changing relationships between governments, corporations and academic scientists; the globalisation of academic research and corporate R D; the role of regulation as a both a response to and a shaper of biotechnologies; the importance of intellectual property rights in the bioeconomy, the legalisation of patents on novel life-based technologies and the globalisation of the IP regime favoured by Western pharmaceutical companies through the TRIPS agreement; and the public health consequences of focusing biomedical R D on emergent biotechnologies

  We seem to live in a world of disasters and emergencies, with one crisis piling on another. In this module we explore the contemporary politics of disasters and emergencies and we examine how critical events garner attention and galvanize social and political action. Rather than take disasters and emergencies as presumably self-evident events for granted, we explore disasters and emergencies as a social imaginary, and that is to say, as a particular way of perceiving the world. This perception is now at the heart of an expanding industry of emergency management and disaster relief. In this module we analyze this global industry, using anthropological, sociological, and historical approaches. How have disasters and emergencies contributed to the rethinking and reshaping of what political action means today? How has the temporality of emergency affected the perception of social and political problems?
Aims
&#61607; To describe the key actors and institutions as well as discourses and practices that seek to address contemporary health crises.
&#61607; To introduce students to the key concepts and debates in anthropological, sociological, and historical studies of disasters and emergencies.
&#61607; To give students the abilities to analyze emergency relief and disaster prevention from a critical point of view.
&#61607; To provide students with an understanding of the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic factors that shape the perception of disasters and emergencies.
&#61607; To provide students with the skills to critically evaluate humanitarian interventions and to identify the role of key stakeholders in shaping them.

  This module examines the phenomenon of war related violence, destruction, distress, and trauma-related health problems, health-seeking and healing practices. We will follow and discuss the debates of researchers who have tried to determine and verify the effects of violent conflict on the mental health of those affected by focusing on concepts like war trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social suffering, and idioms of distress. We will problematize conventional and universal understandings of trauma, and disease-centered approaches to traumatic experience and health interventions.
Class sessions will involve lectures, guest lectures, student presentations, discussions, film screenings, and review activities. To involve students in their own learning, make seminar topics come alive, to deepen students&rsquo; knowledge of a topic, and to develop particular skills, questions which stimulate critical thinking, annotated suggestions for further readings, and lists of related websites will be provided.
Aims
&bull; To introduce students to key concepts and debates around war trauma and relevant interventions.
&bull; To approach mental health and wars from an interdisciplinary angle by reviewing the publications of work in the fields of medicine, public health, psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, history and philosophy.
&bull; To develop an understanding of theories of and approaches related to the key concepts related to war, mental health and healing.
&bull; To synthesise, compare, and critically discuss key concepts, academic debates, research approaches and relevant ethnographic studies.
