  Practicing lawyers are often confronted with the limitations of having to rely on precedent or legislation when advising clients in areas of &lsquo;new&rsquo; law, or where court decisions and statutory regulations are not yet sufficiently available. While this might be due to the fact that the law &ndash; in a domestic setting &ndash; is only slowly awakening to a recently emerged regulatory problem, this governance lag is amplified in the context of transnational activities, where issues of sovereignty, jurisdiction and forum pose additional obstacles to the creation of effective legal regulation. Practically speaking, lawyers in such cases frequently resort to team work, experts, stakeholders and other relevant parties &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo;, eventually shifting their strategy from litigation to a combination of legal consultancy, advocacy, coalition building and even public awareness building. This type of lawyering requires considerable flexibility, competences and resources, which are not readily available to every lawyer. From a theoretical perspective, the lawyer might find herself overwhelmed by what can be the technical or cognitive as well as the moral complexity of the case setting she is working on.
At the centre of the module is the shift away from training lawyers in learning and interpreting the law primarily through the study of jurisprudence (case law as in the common law tradition) or through the interpretation of statutory law (legislation &ndash; civil law tradition). Instead, students are invited to take on the perspective of the lawyer/advocate/activist who is involved in &lsquo;building&rsquo; a case from a set of diverse, inchoate and constantly evolving facts and data. This reversal of perspective is a crucial element in confronting students as future practitioners with the real-world challenges of an effective access to justice.
Assuming the position of legal practice and rights advocacy, students immerse themselves into a case from the &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; by identifying and negotiating the affected and involved interests, finding and navigating the applicable law, including, possibly, &lsquo;soft&rsquo; law, codes of conduct, social norms etcetera, and developing a legal interest representation strategy (&ldquo;LIRS&rdquo;). In contrast to giving legal advice to a client in a more or less confined and concrete legal question regarding, for example; liability, entitlement, conviction or acquittal, the development of a LIRS might include a variety of avenues, including, but not limited to, designing a litigation or defence strategy, the enhancing of legal and political rights, engaging in coalition and public awareness building or contributing to a sustainable stakeholder interest representation process.

  The process of globalisation has rendered the practice and study of corporate law increasingly international. This module, as a natural progression from the prerequisite module &ldquo;Comparative Corporate Law&rdquo;, aims at providing students with a better understanding of the approaches taken by different jurisdictions in a range of corporate law topics and at enhancing their research skills. Topics to be covered will vary from year to year to reflect the most recent research, but will generally include corporate theories; board structures; conflicts of interest between managers, shareholders, and other stakeholders; shareholder actions; control transactions; intermediaries and shareholder voting; and law and finance. Students are expected to research selected areas of comparative corporate law and through readings, class presentations and essay writings they will improve their understanding and awareness of domestic and comparative corporate law.

  This course aims at enhancing the student&rsquo;s understanding of competition law. It builds upon the EU competition law course, focussing in greater detail on complex legal, economic and practical issues raised by a case study. Students will analyse a full and detailed case study, and apply the law critically to the facts of the case study. Students will have an opportunity to discuss the issues raised by the case study in a structured workshop and will be required to work in teams and to make oral presentations on the questions raised. The course will be assessed by students preparing an individual written answer to the problems raised by the case study.
Students wishing to take this option will be required to take the EU Competition Law course or already to have a good working knowledge of EU competition law, including EU merger control.

      Assessment:  
      coursework;     presentation/s;     
    
     
  This course is designed to examine (normally four) advanced topics related to anti-competitive arrangements in greater depth than we normally have time for in the standard modules.
The topics will be discussed and agreed by the students and the module leader in the first session. The topics will be selected not only for their own, substantive importance, but also because they shine a light on the implications of different methodological approaches to the study of law.
Possible topics for this first cycle are: the objectives of the rules against anti-competitive arrangements (Treaty interpretation); what are anti-competitive agreements? (comparative approach between the EU and US); when is a consumer a relevant consumer, other markets and the unborn (socio-political and economic analyses of law); and the International Competition Network and its relevance (transnational competition law).
The class involves inter-active discussions, teamwork an assessed (pass/fail) student presentation (with video of it), and will be assessed through a 10-12,000 word essay.

  This course aims at enhancing the student's understanding of competition law in a transnational perspective by focusing on the in-depth analysis of the law, policy and economics of abuse of dominance (or single firm conduct).
The course is meant to be both topical and student-driven so the choice of themes to be dealt with each year will be determined by topicality, both in terms of developments in case law and enforcement practice and scholarly debate, and students' interests and preferences. These themes may include the following:
the concepts of dominance and market power, their interrelationship and their different applications (for example in two-sided markets or in fast-moving "new economy" markets)
collective (or joint) dominance and the problem of the oligopoly and its interrelationship with the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, e.g. under Article 101 TFEU
the test or tests for determining when conduct that harms, and therefore, excludes competitors should be deemed abusive
whether discrimination by a dominant firm should be deemed to be an abuse and, if so, in what circumstances
whether exploitative practices by a dominant firm (such as charging "excessive" prices) should be deemed to be an abuse and, if so, in what circumstances
specific practices or abuses in specific contexts such as anti-competitive rebates, predation, margin squeezes in network industries (e.g. in the telecommunications industry) and abuses concerning intellectual property rights (e.g. in the pharmaceutical industry)
The course is assessed by a research essay on a topic chosen by the student which the student will have the opportunity to discuss during the course in order to obtain feedback in an interactive way.

  The course highlights a number of key pieces of theoretical knowledge and analytical skills required of law school graduates in legal practice, where effective argumentation and sound legal advice often depend on basic literacy in business administration. The course complements the traditional law school curriculum with the main purpose of equipping students with the basic theoretical knowledge and analytical skills of MBA graduates who are likely to become their major clients.
The course serves as a stand-alone learning experience and as a foundation for the students interested in the business-side of legal concepts studied under corporate law, international finance, M A, securities regulation, and competition law, as well as for students interested pursuing alternative careers in investment banking or management consulting.
The course covers:
Strategic Decision-making: Independent and inter-dependent probabilistic analysis, decision-analysis, applied game theory, and comprehensive review of behavioural decision science and recent research in behavioural economics, including the work of Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman.Contracting Theory: Function of contracts and key elements of effective agreements, including risk allocation and incentive analysis of most common contracts such as construction and production contracts, principal-agent contracts, sale and lease of property contracts, financing contracts, and joint venture agreements.Accounting: Double-entry bookkeeping, including construction and understanding of the balance sheet, the income statement and the statement of cash flows, and basic financial analysis.Finance: Theoretical foundations of modern financial theory, time value of money, financial valuation, risk and return, diversification, Capital Asset Pricing Model, and Efficient Markets theory and its criticism from the perspective of behavioural finance.
In addition to exposing students to descriptive theory in these fields, the module provides prescriptive training to students. For example, in the Accounting unit, the students will learn the definitions and functions of balance sheet, but will also learn how to actually construct it, record ordinary business transactions, and interpret what the various entries mean. Similarly, in Finance unit, the students will study what the time value of money is, however they will also learn how to actually discount various cash flows and value financial assets.
No prior knowledge in any of the course units is required.

  Media regularly report on the involvement of companies in human rights violations, for example, disasters in Bangladeshi clothing factories such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in which over 1,000 employees died; suicides at the Chinese Foxconn company where mobile phone companies had their products manufactured, and FIFA being accused of corruption and the death of scores of workers building the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This module includes various case studies of companies involved in human rights violations either through subsidiaries, business partners or the supply chain.
The existing legal framework to deal with these problems is limited and fragmented. In the US, the Alien Tort Statute provides a basis for litigation but in the Kiobel case, the US Supreme Court has substantially limited the Statute's scope. In Europe, particularly the UK and the Netherlands, companies are sued on the basis of domestic tort law, for example; Trafigura for waste dumping in Ivory Coast and Shell for polluting the Niger Delta. One of the questions addressed in this module, is what the future of US and European litigation is.
This module will also look into how the large gaps in the existing legal framework can be filled. So far, 'hard' law chiefly concentrates on companies' obligations to report about their human rights impact, while 'soft' law issued by international institutions (including the United Nations non-binding Framework and Guidelines and the OECD Guidelines) helps businesses to respect human rights. Moreover, governments nudge companies in the right direction in the context of trade missions, public procurement and export credit conditions. Companies also increasingly regulate each other, such as investors, pension funds, banks and insurers, investing in or financing business projects (and then, for example, applying the Equator principles). Finally, companies increasingly design their own Corporate Social Responsibility policies to ensure they respect human rights. This is a fast moving area of the law that is becoming of pivotal importance for companies, governments and human rights NGOs.

  This module examines the construction of constitutions and the structure of government around the world. Focusing on some of the most disparate countries including Germany, Iraq, and South Africa, the course seeks to understand the wide variety of institutions among existing democracies, paying attention to both constitutional 'success' and constitutional 'failure'. We will examine the differences between parliamentary and presidential systems, federal and unitary states, constitutional courts and supreme courts, and proportional and majoritarian electoral systems. We will also examine and compare the various rights that get constitutional status in some democracies (such as human dignity in Germany) and then assess whether the country's constitutional structure adequately allows for the protection of those rights.

  In recent years, almost all aspects of corporate law have become increasingly international and globalised. An understanding of the approaches taken by different jurisdictions to resolving fundamental challenges faced by companies is therefore highly instructive. This course examines a selection of corporate law topics in a comparative context. The law of the United Kingdom will be used as a point of reference for the discussion of some topics, while particular emphasis will be put on the laws of continental Europe (in particular, Germany) and the United States (in particular, Delaware). 
The approach taken is both functional and comparative, looking at a series of core problems with which any system of corporate law must deal, and analysing, from a functional perspective, the solutions adopted by the systems in question. Topics include: theory of comparative corporate law and economic analysis of law; comparative corporate governance theories; board structures; directors&rsquo; remuneration; shareholder rights; shareholder activism; control transactions; investor protection; convergence or divergence debate.

  Module description
The European Union has taken, and continues to take, significant measures designed to liberalise certain network-based sectors. In opening up those sectors to greater competition, the European Commission has delegated a wide range of regulatory powers to National Regulatory Authorities, who work closely with National Competition Authorities in order to achieve the optimum competitive balance most likely to be able to deliver consumer welfare. That balance is often very difficult to manage, especially the delicate matters of economic judgement that need to be made in relation to the legality of particular practices and the strategically important political initiatives that are undertaken in the affected sectors which can distort the competitive process between Member States.
The module takes an inter-disciplinary approach in exploring how the balance between law and economics on the one hand, and ex post
 and ex ante
 rules on the other, is struck, both at the theoretical level and in its practical application across key sectors. You explore legal, economic and public policy principles that affect regulated sectors, and examine the application of those principles to specific sectors such as electronic communications,  media, air transport and energy (gas and electricity).  In addition, specialist subjects such as financial services, water and postal services are also often considered by guest lecturers.
Recent Article 102 TFEU case-law is particularly relevant here, as are a range of Sector Enquiries that have been conducted by the European Commission (often reflected in public consultations run at Member State level). Moreover, a growing body of administrative practice in the field of merger control explores how behavioural remedies can be applied in connection with mergers in the affected sectors, and the appropriate regulatory institutions that can best assure their proper implementation.
The object of the module is to prepare students for the sorts of issues likely to arise in their home jurisdictions and at Community level in these areas. Most importantly, there will be an emphasis on the evolutionary aspects of policymaking and competition law enforcement in these sectors, given the varying ownership structures and rules in different jurisdictions. As this is an advanced module,  previous knowledge of competition law would clearly be preferred, but is not  required.
The module is taught through lectures, primarily by leading practitioners specialising in the applications of competition law and regulation to particular sectors. The lectures are supplemented by  specialist seminars delivered by economists and regulators, each of whom provides an alternative perspective on the problems already covered in the lectures. You are encouraged to actively engage with the issues being addressed.   At least one Moot Court will be held on a topic of interest.
A three-hour written examination will be set. You will be able to answer by focusing on two specific areas of regulation, for example energy or communications regulation (although if students prefer to discuss more areas they can), but must also be able to respond to general analytical questions which cut across various regulated network sectors.

  Module description
This module discusses copyright law and policy and its role in the protection of intellectual property rights in modern society. It analyses the law in relation to a range of subject matter including films, literary, artistic, dramatic and musical works. There is a consideration of key issues including the criteria for protection, ownership, the duration of copyright and the nature of the rights involved. There will also be an emphasis on issues of importance in professional legal practice, in particular, infringement (together with defences) and the remedies available for the enforcement of rights.
The module also analyses the legal regimes available for the protection of designs, especially as they impact on the business and artistic communities, including the acquisition of registered design protection in the United Kingdom and the European Community and the law relating to unregistered design rights.

  Module description
This module examines core Company Law and the regulatory framework and practice on corporate governance &ndash; the system (structure and process) by which companies are governed (i.e. directed and controlled), and to what purpose (i.e. what overriding value is promoted). Although some commentators allude to convergence in corporate governance, no global corporate governance model exists as yet. Companies operate primarily within boundaries prescribed by national laws and regulations whilst also ensuring that they are compliant with applicable extra-territorial norms. Consequently, a key objective of this course is to examine UK corporate governance regulation, as the primary model, against the background of other models that exist internationally.
Topics included are: the nature of corporate governance and foundational concepts such as corporate personality and limited shareholder liability; veil impairment and the constitutional &lsquo;law&rsquo; of the company, directors&rsquo; duties; shareholder protection; effective board leadership; remuneration control; and shareholder engagement.

  Module description
The overall aim is to ensure that students have an appreciation of the underlying economics employed in anti-trust cases. The emphasis is on the practical application of economics rather than pure theory. On completing the module, you should have an understanding of the economics used in anti-trust case analysis and be aware of both the strengths and weaknesses in its application both theoretically and empirically. A key aim is that you will have an understanding of the economic tools used by anti-trust economists and to be able to engage in a dialogue with these economists.
No previous knowledge of economics is required. Whilst much of the technical economic literature is mathematical, the module will not require an advanced knowledge of mathematics. The approach to formal theory will, as far as possible, be diagrammatical.
Given the extent of the material that needs to be covered, the bulk of the lectures are devoted to formal teaching, however the style will be both informal and interactive, questions are encouraged. The economics will be illustrated by reference to actual cases. By its nature the module proceeds by considering a series of building blocks which together make up the toolkit typically used by economists in anti-trust cases. The slides presented in each seminar will be posted in advance on KEATS (Moodle). In addition, a discussion forum will be set up so that students can ask questions (anonymously if preferred) which will be answered prior to the next seminar and posted on KEATS.

  Module description
EU administrative law has always been an integral part of the law of the European Union, but has only recently attracted greater attention by academics. Its significance is not only demonstrated by the large number of acts which are adopted every year in this area at European level (some 3,000), but also by the content of those acts (risk regulation through the approval of the release of genetically modified organisms and approval of medicinal products, market regulation through antitrust decisions imposing considerable fines on undertakings, etc). EU administrative law also involves a wide variety of actors (European Commission, national administrations, EU agencies, networks, private bodies) and forms (traditional legal instruments, but also a wide range of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; law).
The aim of this module is to introduce you to the principles of administrative law and policy of the European Union. The module discusses the foundations of EU administrative law, its constitutional framework, its modes of delivery (comitology, agencies, open method of co-ordination, social partner agreements), its procedures (centralised and decentralised), the general principles of law which it has to observe (legal certainty and legitimate expectations, equality, proportionality, the precautionary principle, transparency), and the supervision of EU administrative action (political supervision and judicial review).

  Module description
The EU&rsquo;s external policies are ever more sophisticated and wide-ranging, and the EU is a very active international actor. This module concentrates on studying the legal foundations of the EU&rsquo;s external action. It looks at the scope and nature of the EU&rsquo;s external competences, in particular treaty-making powers and the relationship between international and EU law. It also focuses on a couple of case-studies of major EU external policies, namely the EU&rsquo;s common commercial policy and its common foreign and security policy. Those case-studies will exemplify the interaction between the many facets that shape the EU&rsquo;s external relations. The module aims to give you a thorough grounding in what is a very dynamic subject.

  This module explores the new financial regulatory architecture of the European Union and its economic governance. This is an area, in which the EU has only recently asserted more centralised control, mainly due to the financial problems of financial institutions and Member States following the recent financial crisis. The course will discuss the evolution of financial harmonisation law in the Union, the new institutional architecture of the European Supervisory Authorities, as well as the regulatory and enforcement tools at their disposal. 
In addition, the module will discuss the efforts of the European Union to strengthen its economic governance, in particular within the Eurozone. It will analyse the regulatory arrangements and institutional structures within and outside EU law (Banking Union, European Financial Compact, European Stability Mechanism). Students will discuss the constitutional constraints of the system, its practical operation, and the policy choices and challenges behind the new regulatory regime.
This module is of considerable practical relevance to practising lawyers in the financial services industry, but also for those who are interested in the constitutional and administrative law problems which the new regulatory regime raises.

EU public procurement law has emerged as a major area of practice for EU lawyers, bolstered by the increased use of PFI contracts, the introduction of new enforcement procedures in 2009 and a growing volume of cases before the European and Member State courts. This module offers a comprehensive grounding in the EU regime. It covers: 

the policy objectives of the EU public procurement law regime and its foundations in the TFEU;
the substantive rules relating to entities and contracts covered, award procedures, selection of bidders and contract award criteria;
information disclosure requirements, in particular the European courts&rsquo; evolving case law and the relationship with the general principle of transparency and Freedom of Information laws;
the use of public procurement to further social, policy and environmental objectives; and
enforcement mechanisms and practice throughout the EU, including the new Remedies Directive and Article 258 TFEU infraction proceedings.

  Module description
The EU regulation of public undertakings and EU state aid law are increasingly important parts of EU competition law. The case law at national and European levels is growing in both number and importance, particularly of late. The reasons for this increasing focus on public intervention in the economy are numerous and varied but they primarily relate to the impact of such intervention on the completion of the internal market and the current liberalization and privatisation processes. The module focuses on the relevant provisions of the Treaty, most notably Articles 86, 87 and 88; analysing them (and the resulting case law/ decisions) through various legal, political and economic prisms. For more details please see the module outline at the bottom of this page. No previous knowledge of the subject is required.
The module is taught in seminars; you are encouraged to actively engage with the issues being addressed.

  Module description
The concept of a common market involves the elimination of all obstacles to intra-community trade in order to merge the national markets into a single market bringing about conditions as close as possible to those of a genuine internal market&rsquo; (Schul, 1982). The module, by focusing on the development and application of the principle of free movement, assesses whether those objectives have been fully achieved. The structure is firmly grounded on the four fundamental freedoms: goods, persons, services and capital. Each of the freedoms is thoroughly analysed with reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to relevant legislation. &lsquo;Exemplary&rsquo; areas such as financial services, food law or the regulation of monopolies are also included. Particular attention is devoted to the debate on whether the same criteria and principles may be applied to the whole of the internal market and to the degree of convergence of the economic freedoms in EU law.

  Module description
European Labour Law is divided into six parts. 
Part One examines the historical development and evolution of European Labour Law, as well as its economic and social purposes. 
Part Two examines the wider international human rights context within which European Labour Law operates, including in particular the legal instruments of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Council of Europe. 
Part Three examines the institutional competences and framework for the making of European Labour Law, and examines the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the development of the discipline. Consideration is also given to different ways of developing standards at EU level, by way of regulatory legislation and collective bargaining.Thereafter, European Labour Law examines selected areas of substantive law dealing with worker protection. 
In Part Four these include areas dealing with the position of so-called atypical workers (agency, fixed term and part time workers); working conditions (including working time and the protection of posted workers); and job security (including transfer of undertakings, redundancy and insolvency). 
In Part Five the focus turns to collective matters and the duty of the employer to inform and consult, including European Works Councils. 
Part Six deals with recent judicial decisions relating to trade union rights and considers their implications for European Labour Law as a whole.
In addition to the foregoing, time will be devoted to assessing future prospects in light of the current crisis in the Eurozone. Parts One &ndash; Three are dealt with in Semester One, while parts Four &ndash; Six are dealt with in Semester Two. Two &ndash; four classes are devoted to each part.

It explains what modern commercial banks and investment banks do, what products and services they develop and offer (now usually at the international level), what risks they take, what the legal and regulatory concerns are in terms of their operations, risk management and client protection, and how modern law and regulation attempt to deal with these matters.
The further subject is the operation of the modern financial markets in bonds, equities and derivatives, the manner in which these investments are now issued, traded and held; the trading, custody, clearing and settlement of these financial products; and the modern legal frameworks that operate in this connection and the regulatory principles that apply.
Finally the principle issues and concerns in investment management will be discussed as well as the regulatory regime concerning this activity.
This is module is practical as well as conceptual. You do not need prior knowledge in the field of modern finance.

  EU law impacts in a wide variety of ways on almost every aspect of commercial life in the European Union (and often beyond). This module aims at providing students with the opportunity to gain deeper understanding and knowledge of the impact of EU law in commercial transactions and to develop commercially viable solutions to what are often complex legal issues. Students will have to develop an awareness of how EU law can restrict or facilitate such transactions. They are expected to research selected areas of substantial and procedural aspects of EU law and to employ their knowledge in a commercially relevant way. Students will be confronted with different practical scenarios (be it in meetings where they need to negotiate, or by submitted written documents) on various sides of the transaction (be it as Commission officials, representatives of law firms, general counsel of companies and so on).

  The last twenty-five years have seen an increased involvement of Western states in military operations abroad, including peace-keeping missions, military action in the so-called &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo; and several instances of &lsquo;humanitarian&rsquo; or &lsquo;pro-democratic&rsquo; intervention in various parts of the globe. In parallel, as a response to abuses committed during such operations and as a result of the calls for greater accountability by NGOs and civil society, domestic courts and international monitoring bodies have progressively provided greater scrutiny of the conduct of States engaged in military action abroad, an area traditionally thought to be mostly beyond the scope of judicial control. Over the past decade, domestic and international case law has progressively extended the scope of application of international human rights standards in order to ensure protection of individuals not taking part in the hostilities, combatants and &lsquo;enemy fighters&rsquo;, and, more recently, members of the armed forces vis-&agrave;-vis their national State.
The application of human rights standards in the context of armed conflict and related complex emergencies raises a number of challenging theoretical, moral and practical issues; the subject area is one of some complexity, located at the intersection of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, the jus ad bellum and United Nations law. It is an area which remains in a state of flux and is a particular target for strategic human rights litigation and advocacy activities by NGOs.
The module explores this increasingly important area of law and assesses the role and effectiveness of international human rights law instruments and mechanisms as instruments of protection in times of conflict. Part 1 of the module examines a range of &lsquo;threshold&rsquo; questions, including the applicability of human rights law in times of war; the relationship of human rights law with international humanitarian law and other branches of international law, and the extraterritorial applicability of human rights treaties, Part 2 then examines, through the medium of case studies, the way in which selected human rights are applicable during armed conflict, and the remedies available post-conflict in order to ensure justice and adequate reparation for the victims of violations.

  Our world has never been richer and has plenty of resources and technology to satisfy its whole population's basic needs. If equally distributed, the gross world product (GWP) of 2013 ($87.25 trillion) would allow for each world citizen more than $13,000 a year, that is, over 28 times the World Bank extreme poverty threshold of $1.25 a day. The reality however, is that more than a billion people are still below that threshold, almost half of the world population is below the higher poverty threshold of $2 a day, and more than 80% are below the vulnerability threshold of $10 a day. This is in great part due to the model of regulation of economic development adopted in most parts of the world, and in the global system as a whole, which, as argued recently by French economist Thomas Picketty in his celebrated book 'Capital in the 21st Century', sustains an extremely unequal distribution of income and wealth.
What are the moral and legal implications of this state of affairs, in particular from the perspective of development and the rule of law? Is development simply economic growth, as measured by GDP? Can inequality and development coexist? Are inequality and poverty a violation of human rights? Can the rule of law survive in a highly inegalitarian environment? What, if anything, can/should law (and lawyers) do to fight poverty and inequality? What is the role of global law firms and of an increasingly transnational legal profession in these border-crossing processes of economic development, institutional, financial and legal assistance?
This module focuses on the very concrete legal, economic, political as well as ethical challenges that lawyers face when working in this context. The materials studied in the course - cutting-edge development scholarship, policy papers, economic, sociological and political analysis and reports from NGOs and international organisations - will enable the practicing lawyer or legal advisor in international law and development to understand and approach intricate development issues from a solid theoretical and empirical perspective. The engagement with these complex materials will always occur with concrete legal problems and policy challenges in view, allowing for a highly practice-relevant study of international law and development "in context".
The module will also introduce students to the short but rich history of the field of 'law and development' since its origins in the 1960s. This historical background is crucial for an understanding of the challenges the field is facing today. The module starts with an introduction to the debates on the concept of poverty and inequality, their measurement and an analysis of the most recent data. It turns then to the idea of development and the current challenges to the narrow definition of development and growth as merely economic. Drawing on the work of some of the world's most renowned economists and law   development experts, we will discuss the concept of human development and the contested concept of human rights, with a particular focus on both political and socio-economic rights, such as political participation, the right to health, education, housing and an adequate standard of living. The course then turns to an investigation of the intricate and very vividly discussed relationship between the idea of the rule of law and development, in the light of persisting global inequality. The module aims to engage with this evolving debate and also investigate current transnational legal efforts, especially in the field of human rights advocacy and litigation, to fight poverty and inequality. Special attention will be given here to the growing expertise and insights fast emerging from developing countries themselves on the impact of development efforts, including the judicialization of politics in many countries, in particular Latin America, South Africa and Asia, in the field of socio-economic policy.

  In our increasingly globalized society family law is no longer an isolated field that simply represents the traditions and values of an individual culture. Transnational influences including human rights, regional norms and international scrutiny, have played a crucial role in opening family law to widening perspectives.
At the same time, individuals and families are moving across borders in a manner not seen in previous eras. As a result, cross-border disputes are coming to the attention of national and regional courts, and jurisdiction no longer solely rests in one easily definable location.
The first part of the course will take a comparative approach, and consider the ways in which different jurisdictions approach the regulation of adult relationships, the recognition of gender, and parenthood. This will give students the opportunity to study the principles and policies underlying family law, and the way in which legal ideas migrate from one jurisdiction to another.
The second part of the course will examine the resolution of family disputes that cross national borders, including parental child abduction, intercountry adoption, and reproductive technology and surrogacy. Students will analyse the interaction between international human rights law and private international law in regulating these practices, and consider whether it is possible to develop a uniform approach to these transnational practices.

  Module description
This module, which was introduced by David Hayton and Paul Matthews in 1995, was the first of its kind in the world and deals with trusts in the international context. Reflecting on King's strong reputation in trust and comparative law, it examines the extremes to which trust principles may be pressed in the offshore world, as well as conflicts of laws issues. The module considers how three trust jurisdictions deal with selected aspects of trust law and what trust-like arrangements exist in non-trust countries. You are not required to have studied trust law formally in your first degree but will be assumed to understand trust law at the ordinary undergraduate level, or to be prepared to reach this level during the year. Students from civil law systems can &ndash; and do &ndash; take this module.

  Module description

The teaching part of this module takes place over two terms. The first term comprises a thorough grounding in the theory and practice of international commercial arbitration. The module provides a practical insight into fundamental principles, from an international perspective, by reference to the principal conventions and model laws, and the current approaches to this field in different jurisdictions. In the second term you move on to investment treaty arbitration and other forms of substantive protection that may be available to investors. Topics on this part of the module include the investment dispute resolution facility of the ICSID Convention, and the substantive and procedural protections that may be available to investors under bilateral (BIT) or multilateral (e.g. NAFTA) investment treaties.
All students will attend both parts of the module. The basic format entails one two-hour lecture per week, with a number of &lsquo;cross-over&rsquo; seminars over the two terms in which the interplay between these two areas of international arbitration is explored. There will also be a number of tutorials given throughout the year for which you will be expected to submit written work. In the summer term, you will have the opportunity to prepare a dissertation or research essay for submission. There will also be the possibility to participate in practical &ldquo;moot&rdquo; sessions, alongside formal classes.

  This module aims to provide students with a solid foundation in international and transnational human rights law - widely conceived as one of the most important and relevant legal fields in a global context today. We cover the core of human rights protected under international law, including civil and political rights such as freedom of speech and religion, political participation, fair trial and the right not to be tortured, and social and economic rights such as health, education, housing and an adequate standard of living. The objective is to both develop over the course of the academic year an analytical framework for understanding and critically analysing the international and transnational institutions and mechanisms in place for the protection of human rights and also to provide an effective preparation for the real-world challenges of transnational human rights practice.
In that vein, we begin by offering an overview of the development of the idea of human rights and the international legal institutional framework for its protection as well as the philosophical and political underpinnings and challenges to the idea of universal human rights. We then cover the practical functioning of selected human rights monitoring mechanisms with particular emphasis on their effectiveness and the political and institutional challenges and obstacles they face. This segment will take up the core of the course and allow students to explore the foundations and applications of human rights in concrete application contexts.

  Module description

The module covers the key components of the public international law related to the protection of foreign investment. Reference is made to relevant customary and conventional international law (particularly bilateral investment treaties), as well as to relevant regional and municipal law. The module is concerned with the substantive normative framework of the international law relating to foreign investment (procedural aspects are addressed in the course on International Commercial Arbitration). It also addresses the key legal obligations of the host State (MFN, National Treatment, Expropriation, Fair and Equitable Treatment, Transparency) as well as the legal obligations of the foreign investor. Policy considerations underlying this area of the law will also be examined.

  This module aims at providing students with the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of the international investment law and policy regime. Students will have to develop an awareness of the critical legal issues in the current regime, including the substantive protections afforded to foreign investors and the dispute settlement mechanisms provided by the system. Policy considerations underlying this area of the law will be examined as international investment law broadly limits States&rsquo; regulatory prerogatives in many important and sensitive economic sectors such as energy, transportation, water services.
As the practice project will be different every year, during the first seminar, we will provide more details on the specific project.
While strictly speaking there is no pre-requisite for the course, we strongly suggest enrolling in either the International Commercial and Investment Arbitration or International Investment Law modules.

  We will start from the prohibition to use force in international relations contained in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and will then proceed to analyse the exceptions to this prohibition: those codified in the UN Charter (self-defence, collective security) and those which are not (e.g., humanitarian intervention).
We will review and assess the basic jus ad bellum doctrines, while also examining various armed conflicts in relation to which these doctrines have been applied and shaped. For example, we will consider the doctrinal legacy left by the intervention in Kosovo and by the invasion of Iraq. Key questions to be addressed include: how should the use of force be defined for the purpose of legal regulation? What is the scope of the right of self-defence? Does self-defence cover the right to use force to protect nationals abroad, to pre-empt an attack that is not imminent, or to act against a state that is harbouring terrorists? Are interventions to further democracy or to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction legitimate exceptions to the prohibition of recourse to force? Throughout the module, you will be invited to think about jus ad bellum as a contested field in which different actors &ndash; legal advisers to foreign offices, military lawyers, international lawyers working for NGOs, legal scholars, activists and others &ndash; all play a part.

  Module description
This module will cover both international law on the use of force (jus ad bellum) and international law governing the conduct of warfare (jus in bello). The jus ad bellum part will begin with an anlaysis of the prohibition on the use of force in Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter and will then proceed to examine the exceptions to the prohibition: those codified in the UN Charter (self-defence, collective security) and those which are not (e.g., humanitarian intervention).
We will review and assess the basic jus ad bellum doctrines, while also examining various armed conflicts in relation to which these doctrines have been applied and shaped. Throughout the module, you will be invited to think about jus ad bellum as a contested field in which different actors &ndash; legal advisers to foreign offices, military lawyers, international lawyers working for NGOs, legal scholars, activists and others &ndash;play a part.
In the jus in bello part of the course, you will become familiar with the relevant customary and treaty law, and engage in a critical analysis of judicial decisions and state practice. The issues that will be addressed include: the distinction between international and non-international armed conflict; the protection of civilians; the law of weaponry and the conduct of hostilities; the relationship between international human rights law and the jus in bello; the law of occupations; and questions of enforcement and implementation.
Throughout the course, current debates on the changing nature of warfare, with a focus on the extent to which they have informed the practice of state and non-state actors, will be considered.
Important note:
This module is offered in conjunction with the War Studies Department.  
There are a limited number of places available on this module. These are shared between students from The Dickson Poon School of Law and the War Studies Department.

  Module description
This module considers taxation in an international context. Domestic tax systems have increasingly had to respond to globalisation so that taxation can still be viable in an environment where activities which have traditionally attracted taxation can be carried out without domestic borders to define their scope. The module will consider taxation and international law in general and then move on to looking at the ways in which domestic systems have sought to deal with double taxation where activities attracting taxation are carried out over more than one country &ndash; namely through double taxation conventions. The focus will be on the OECD Model and double taxation conventions based on this and why international business gives tax systems a problem and how this can be addressed.

  Module description
A contract for the sale of goods lies at the heart of and is central to commercial law. Similarly, an international sales contract is a key international commercial transaction which often gives rise to several interrelated legal arrangements. They are the arrangements with a bank for the payment or finance of the purchase price, contracts of carriage of goods and marine insurance, covering the goods. This module examines: how these contracts are governed; the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties to the respective contracts; and the relationship between the sales, financing, carriage and insurance contracts. The module will address these issues on the basis of English law, which is often the preferred choice of law in international trade, and the relevant international instruments.
Part I of the course will focus on the salient features of the cross-border sale of goods contracts. It will explore in detail the rules of English law (Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the common law) governing the international sale of goods contracts. The issues covered will include: the basic concepts of English law of sale of goods; the implied terms of a sales contract (such as the implied terms of quality and description of the goods); the structure of and legal issues arising from contracts incorporating such trade terms as CIF (&lsquo;cost, insurance, freight&rsquo;) and FOB (&lsquo;free on board&rsquo;); remedies for breach of an international sales contract. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 1980 (CISG) &ndash; a leading international sales law instrument, now ratified by more than eighty countries - will also receive a substantial amount of attention. The course will address such aspects of the CISG as the scope of its application, general provisions, rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer and remedies for breach of contract governed by the CISG.
Part II will examine the key financial instruments and methods of payment used in international trade. These instruments are used either to enable payments in the underlying transaction or to provide a guarantee in the case of a breach of the underlying transaction. The instruments covered in this course are collections, documentary credits (letters of credit) and autonomous bank guarantees. The key international instruments covered in this course have all been produced by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and include: Uniform Rules for Collections (URC 522; 1995 revision); Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 2007 (the UCP 600); Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG 758; 2010 revision); International Standby Practices (ISP98).
Part III of the course examines legal issues arising from the need to transport the goods by sea (the main mode of transport in international trade) and how contracts for the carriage of goods by sea are governed. The issues addressed in this part of the course will be: the common rules implied in contracts of carriage; the voyage and time charterparties; bills of lading; the application of the Hague-Visby Rules, incorporated into English law by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. The Hague-Visby Rules are an amendment to the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading (Hague Rules, adopted 1924), incorporated in a document known as the Brussels Protocol 1968. Other international conventions, such as the UN Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea 1978 (the Hamburg Rules) and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (the Rotterdam Rules) 2008, will be touched upon briefly.
Part IV will be concerned with the fundamentals of the marine cargo insurance contracts. The examination will be based on the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the Institute Cargo Clauses and Insurance Act 2015. This part is intended to introduce students to the marine insurance contracts and aims to examine the origins, functions and role of insurance generally and of marine insurance in particular as well as their linkages with risk taking as the main catalyst for commercial ventures and economic development. The issues covered in this part will include: an introduction to the marine insurance law and practice; insurable interest in the subject-matter insured; the doctrines of utmost good faith, disclosure and representations; warranties; perils covered by the marine insurance policy; claim for indemnity.

  The field of International Dispute Resolution is developing at an ever-faster pace. The number of dispute settlement mechanisms has multiplied to such an extent that even experts of international law can rarely claim to have a thorough knowledge of most of them. Their scope, breadth and effectiveness, however, imply that a basic knowledge of the available fora is essential not just for lawyers working in international law, but for lawyers in general.
The module presents a practical survey of modern international dispute resolution, focusing on European Courts, the International Court of Justice, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement system and arbitration. It does not cover international criminal courts, conflict of laws or (in general) litigation in national courts. Besides examining basic aspects of the different systems, the module will give a more practical insight into the procedure and litigation in the different fora.

  The EU is based on the rule of law and the European integration process has been characterized as &lsquo;integration through law&rsquo;. At the heart of the EU legal system are the EU&rsquo;s judicial institutions, in particular the Court of Justice. On the basis of a few EU Treaty provisions the Court has fashioned a comprehensive and dynamic system of judicial protection. This module studies that system by analysing its two essential components.
It first concentrates on the application and enforcement of EU law in the Member States. In that context the module analyses the concepts of direct effect and Member State liability; the preliminary rulings system; and enforcement actions by the Commission. The second component consists of judical review of EU acts, where you study both actions for annulment and the non-contractual liability of the EU. This module has a strong practical orientation, to make you familiar with the system of EU judicial protection, so as to enable you to use EU remedies in practice.

  This is an advanced  module which considers the evolving role of labour law in times of austerity. At the present time, many workers in the public and private sectors find that they are losing their jobs or that their working conditions are being diminished. It is claimed that this is an inevitable consequence of what are also said to be necessary cuts in public spending and the consequences of the global financial difficulties. This module  examines the legal protections available to workers in an age of austerity and invites students to think creatively about how these protections can be used and developed as creative tools of better protection.
The  module is divided into three parts, with three to four classes being devoted to each part. 
Part One provides historical context to the age of austerity and an understanding of contemporary problems. It examines the role of labour law in previous economic crises, and considers the origins, nature and problems created by the current crisis. 
Part Two looks at the implications of the age of austerity for workers' rights and considers how developing principles of the contract of employment, equality legislation, and job security legislation (such as that relating to collective redundancy) can be used to protect workers from cuts. This will be done in the context of contemporary disputes where the law is being used by both sides, in the case of employers to implement and in case of workers to resist change.
Part Three is concerned with the role of trade unions when faced with job losses for their members and a deterioration in terms and conditions of employment. Here we examine the implications of legal restraints on trade union freedom (again in the context of contemporary disputes), but also consider whether there are legal devices available to trade unions which so far are being under-utilised. Consideration is also given to the question of litigation as a trade union strategy for dealing with austerity, including litigation not only in the domestic courts but in international forums as well, including the ILO and the Council of Europe.

  This one-year (40 credits) module will provide students with a foundation in law and society in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (&lsquo;China&rsquo;), as one of the most important, but also challenged and challenging, legal-political systems in the world today. Our objective is to facilitate, over the course of the academic year, a critical understanding of how law operates in Chinese society, and to prepare students for future engagement with Chinese law in various professional contexts. Specific topics to be addressed will include the role of law in Chinese history; the legacy of Mao Zedong and legal reform in the post-Mao era; central aspects of the judicial process, dispute resolution systems and access to justice; the basic principles of private, commercial and administrative law; central issues in criminal justice; the role of civil society and human rights advocacy; and transnational aspects of rule of law development in China. A central claim underlying the design of this module is that these topics should be studied in their entirety and in context.

  Since 9/11 there has been an 'amazing downloading' of international law in the form of Security Council resolutions into domestic jurisdictions. This has fundamental consequences not only for constitutional law and civil liberties, but also how the private sector functions. Aside from sanctions, actions under the auspices of the UN Office of Drugs and Crime on, for example; corruption, human trafficking, piracy, and wildlife and forest crime also have an increasing impact on domestic and transnational operations, as have the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the 'Ruggie Principles'). This module examines this UN interaction with other legal systems, in particular the EU and the UK, and private actors.
The first part of the course will acquaint students with the legal foundations of the United Nations - its origins, conceptual and institutional structure and competence, and familiarize them with the evolving practice at the UN. It will also address some of the current and enduring challenges facing the UN system, contrasting theory with practice, including the growing role of NGOs in the work of the UN.
The second part of the course will explore how the UN interacts with other legal systems, individuals and the private business sector through UN Security Council sanctions, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and initiatives such as the Ruggie Principles, examining the conflicts and interactions that result. As well as the human rights and constitutional aspects, we will look at what the growth in international governance measures under UN auspices means for domestic and transnational commercial entities, commercial law, corporate responsibility for the actions of subsidiaries in other jurisdictions implicated in human rights and other violations of international law and, more broadly, the growing role of the private sector in the implementation of international law.
The intention of the course is to bring together themes that are often examined in separate courses. The learning objective is that students would come away with an understanding of the United Nations, public international law and the interaction between legal systems, as well as a practical understanding of the law from the perspective of a transnational practice and the commercial sector (banks, insurers, shippers etc). It is designed to appeal both to students who want to develop their theoretical understanding of international law and those who plan to move into private practice; all the tutors involved have a background in both practice and academia. The module is also suited for those taking the European Law and International Business Law LLM pathways.

  Accountants, investment bankers and transactional lawyers are the three professional advisors that play significant roles in corporate finance transactions.
This module focuses, from a UK legal perspective, on the two main sources of corporate finance. It deals with equity financing &ndash; the law that regulates its raising, maintenance and pay&ndash;outs from the corporate treasury, and with debt financing &ndash; forms of debt finance and security interests. It concludes by examining three major kinds of financial transactions that companies get involved in: secondary issues, debt equity swaps and private equity transactions.

  The module draws upon thirty years of interdisciplinary research in negotiation from the perspectives of law, economics, game theory, and social and cognitive-behavioural psychology.
It provides comprehensive theoretical background as well as training in analytical and interpersonal aspects of negotiation. It aims to address the requirements of modern legal practice, where effective legal work often entails negotiations in complex interpersonal settings involving multiple parties and multiple issues, and where deal-making, consensus building, and problem-solving frequently take the central stage.
The module explores the Principled negotiation model developed atHarvardLawSchool, as well as advanced interdisciplinary theory on negotiation, including the Three Tensions model and the insights from modern social, cognitive-behavioural and psychodynamic psychology.
In addition to the intensive reading, the students are expected to negotiate complex proprietary negotiation cases on a weekly basis. Case experience is used as material for class discussion and for explication of the relevant theory.
Attendance of the enrolled students will be mandatory.

  In the era marked by the internationally notorious WikiLeaks and Snowden affairs, transparency and openness are becoming buzzwords of most of the debates on government legitimacy and accountability. The European Union is no exception, with the principle of transparency having been progressively integrated into the law, first through the decisions of the Court in relation to the right of access to documents and then, after the 1990s, through Treaty amendments and secondary legislation. Currently enshrined in Article 1 TEU and 15 TFEU, the principle consists essentially of various forms of active cooperation and communication between the EU institutions and the public, typically entailing access to information. However, establishing to what extent open government is also good government is not a straightforward question. Thus, lifting the veil of secrecy over various institutional practices is a matter on which consensus is often hard to reach.
This module aims at enabling reflection on open government at the European Union level. It will explore in depth the principle of transparency and the way it has been rendered operational in EU primary, secondary legislation, and case law, as well as in EU institutional practices. At the theoretical level, the focus is on determining the rationale, the content and the boundaries of the principle of transparency. In particular, we will be assessing the highly contested link between the principles of transparency on the one hand and legitimacy and accountability on the other. The module will also look at the contents of the principle of transparency &ndash; is it just a passive right of every citizen to have access to information or is it a broader concept, entailing a pro-active institutional duty to ensure that all its actions, as well as the information about these actions, are carried out in an accessible and understandable way? Furthermore, we will be discussing the costs of transparency, and to what extent does this principle interact with other fundamental principles such as respect of private life of individuals or impartiality of justice.
These questions shall be contextualised through an analysis of the degree of openness of different European institutions. We will be covering issues ranging from the refusal to grant access to files held by the European Commission, to the disclosure of information on how various countries vote within the Council, and to the reasons for which a large part of the activity of the Court of Justice of the European Union is still exempted from the application of the principle of transparency. The debates will draw mainly on legal arguments, but also on interdisciplinary sources, in particular on theories coming from sociology, political science, and public administration.

  Module description
This module offers you the opportunity to read, or re-read, key texts from classics in Western political thought that have shaped thinking about the international order. It does not purport to give an exhaustive overview of the subject, but rather to examine ideas and arguments about such issues as the nature of the state, the concept of sovereignty, the problem of peace, and international organisation, in analytical and philosophical depth. Works from (among others) Machiavelli, Bodin, Grotius, Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant and Hegel will form part of the course.
The module is particularly suited to those interested in normative argument about international law and international relations who feel their knowledge of the classics of political thought is rather limited. Neither a background in international law nor one in legal and political philosophy is required; a great deal of curiosity and some measure of patience will however assist you in an intellectual journey that is fascinating but also challenging.
Important note:
This module is offered in conjunction with the War Studies Department.  
There are a limited number of places available on this module. These are shared between students from The Dickson Poon Schol of Law and the War Studies Department.

  The  module concerns the impact of information technologies on the private lives of individuals. The digitisation of information has brought about a multitude of data harvesting and processing technologies that now operate on a global scale. Information processing has become essential not just to finance and commerce, but also to advances in public health, education, crime prevention and economic growth.
In this module,  you will study the legal concepts and rules that are used to determine the limits of personal autonomy and consent in the new world of 'big data'. It will focus on rights to privacy and confidentiality as well as countervailing rights and interests in freedom of speech, public order and security and collective well being.  We will  also examine laws that enable individual access to personal information, such as freedom of information law, and other means of controlling personal information. The module will focus on European legal standards, including their implementation in member states and states outside the European Union, as well as comparison with alternative legal models and concepts, such as those prevailing in the United States and China.

  This module considers the UK&rsquo;s comprehensive &ldquo;one-stop&rdquo; regime for the regulation of financial services activity, established under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA 2000). This regime applies to all financial services firms operating in the UK (in particular, on the London financial market) and reflects the harmonising measures of the EU&rsquo;s Financial Services Action Plan. The module examines the key legal issues which arise under that regime. First, the regulatory institutions are examined, in particular, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) which is the UK&rsquo;s &ldquo;single regulator&rdquo;. The wide scope of the regime, which covers investment business, banking and insurance, is also explored. The administrative and civil law framework within which the regime operates, as well as the full range of regulatory mechanisms available under it, are also considered.
Having taken this module, you may move on to a more detailed examination of the FSMA regime, in Regulation of Financial Services: Part 2.

The module begins with a more detailed consideration of some aspects of the regime, with seminars on the regulation of banking and insurance. It also examines the application of FSMA 2000 to &ldquo;collective investment schemes&rdquo;, both heavily regulated retail scheme such as unit trusts and open-ended investment companies (mutual funds, SICAVs) and &ldquo;unregulated&rdquo; schemes such as hedge funds.
Finally, it considers the market abuse regime (insider dealing and market manipulation) and the UK's provisions on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.

  Accountants, investment bankers and transactional lawyers are the three professional advisors that play significant roles in M A transactions, which are increasingly becoming established features of most advanced capitalist systems.
This module focuses on the routes by which outcomes (the takeover or merger) are structured and it provides a comprehensive examination of how the conduct of these transactions is regulated in the UK, especially in light of the implementation of the Takeovers Directive on 20 May 2006. It will entail the exposition of the Takeover Code&rsquo;s General Principles and Rules through cases decided by the Takeover Panel, in addition to relevant judicial authorities. The study of this jurisprudence will be a major theme of the module, whilst providing a strong theoretical underpinning to the subject.
Although the emphasis will be on regulation under Takeover Code (from which the European Directive draws many of its provisions) the module will also, in appropriate areas, consider different approaches to the subject under Federal and State regulation in the United States.

  Regulation has become a permanent feature of the way in which contemporary democratic economies (including Britain and other European countries) are governed. There are few spheres of economic activity that are not subject to some form of regulatory oversight and control. Daily news programmes rarely pass without some mention of a significant regulatory decision, proposed regulatory reform, or allegations of some regulatory failure or scandal. For lawyers, dealings with regulators and regulatory regimes have become part of the staple diet of their work. Yet the practice of regulation is far from straightforward. Regulatory policy and practice has evolved considerably from its traditional origins in the form of &lsquo;command and control&rsquo;, accompanied by the growth of specific terminology and concepts that are likely to be unfamiliar to those other than regulatory technocrats. This course provides an opportunity for students to develop an understanding of, and critically to evaluate, the basic tools, techniques and decision-making methodologies that are employed in regulatory design and practice. It will be of interest to both private and public sector lawyers who practice in regulated sectors of the economy, enhancing their understanding of how regulators go about the business of regulatory decision-making.
This module is aimed at providing students with a set of general analytical tools and concepts that may be applied to the regulation of any domain of social activity, in any jurisdiction, in seeking to understand how regulatory authorities pursue the social and/or economic objectives that they are expected to promote. Students will develop an awareness the challenges (of both a principled and practical kind) associated with attempts by regulatory authorities in seeking to promote particular social goals, including an appreciation of the kinds of conflicts and tensions which may arise within, or as a product of, the regulatory process. It will also enable students to undertake a critical appraisal of regulatory institutions, policy and practice, including the role and limits of the law&rsquo;s contribution to regulation.
First, we will begin by exploring debates about the nature of regulation, the regulatory state, and the role of law in the regulatory endeavour. Secondly, we will explore different techniques and instruments of regulation, ranging from classical 'command-and-control' regulation through to instruments which rely primarily on other competition, consensus, communication or 'code' (architecture) as the means for regulating social behaviour. Thirdly, we will consider so-called &lsquo;new governance&rsquo; approaches to regulation and the factors which may influence the choice of regulatory instrument. Fourthly, we examine issues of enforcement and compliance styles, including the role of the civil and criminal law, the role of private enforcement, and explore the way in which regulatory enforcement is carried out &lsquo;at the sharp end&rsquo; in the practice of regulatory enforcement officials.
No previous knowledge of the subject is required. This module will be useful to students from a range of backgrounds (including but not limited to those with an interest in competition and utilities regulation) particularly those interested in public policy generally, or in the regulation of particular sectors, such as technology, banking, energy, healthcare and so forth. It encourages students to view the law in a fresh light, drawing upon insights from various social scientific perspectives (including politics, economics and criminology) in order to understand how the law helps to shape public policy outcomes and social behaviour more generally.

  Transnational legal studies map the emergence of new forms of law aimed at addressing a range of complex socio-economic and political trans-border problems. These problems have emerged against the backdrop of shifts in nation states&rsquo; regulatory governance patterns wherein non-state actors play a crucial role by articulating social norms, policies and processes leading to the production of a densely plural legal field of which formal state law is only one, albeit significant, element. Socio-legal scholars engaged in the study of sociology of law, legal pluralism and legal cultures have long been preoccupied with the study of these aspects of the law within the domestic context. To elaborate, the sociology of law is the systematic, theoretically grounded, empirical study of law as embedded in society. Sociologists of law empirically examine and theorise the interaction between law, legal, non-legal institutions and social factors. Increasingly, sociologists of law also understand law sociologically so that they are not merely preoccupied with the study of law and society but of law in society. Areas of socio-legal inquiry include legal pluralism, the social development of legal institutions, forms of social control, legal regulation, the interaction between legal cultures, the social construction of legal issues, the 'law in the books' and the 'law in action', the legal profession, and the relation between law and social change.

  Taxation is a key factor in business decisions, and how to raise tax from businesses without damaging the economy is a central element in all government&rsquo;s policy.
In this module we will examine the taxation of businesses under UK income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. We will also consider, to a lesser extent, VAT, the UK interaction with foreign taxes, and stamp duty.
Although it is based around the UK tax system, the module deals with questions about the taxation of businesses that face all tax systems. Its object is to provide a solid grounding in the principles of the taxation of businesses, and the main rules will be studied in depth in the context of those principles.

  The module addresses the challenges that have long been arising for national governments and international organizations in effectively regulating border-crossing activities. Taking a historical as well as conceptual perspective on both legitimate and criminal activities, we will study key areas of transnational networks and regimes in order to identify the scope as well as the limits of law in governing private transnational actors. By looking at examples of global networks drawn from the present and the past, e.g. diamond traders, merchants of the Northern Mediterranean Sea, mafias, and pirates in the early 18th century, it will become apparent how a traditional, state-based 'top-down' approach in legal regulation often proves insufficient.
The core reason for taking this historical-conceptual view is to critically investigate an ever faster developing reality of transnational private regulatory activity, ranging from food security to technical standards, from credit ratings to poverty levels, or from minimum capital requirements to educational standards. In view of the persisting 'democracy deficit' on the global level in such a wide range of hotly contested and sensitive regulatory areas, lawyers need to develop a better understanding of how transnational regimes operate, regulate and govern. For each of these global networks, the students will be asked to focus on the nature and content of the norms developed within these networks, as well as the processes through which these norms are enforced at a transnational level.

This module analyses the law and policy in respect of registered trademarks. There is a consideration of the registration system for trademarks both in the United Kingdomand the European Community. In this context, the module covers central issues such as the subject matter which can be registered, absolute and relative grounds for refusal of registration, revocation, infringement and defences. Additionally, the module considers legal regimes for the protection of unregistered marks, in particular, the action for passing off (with its constituent elements of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage).
An assessment will be made of the effectiveness of the law of trademarks, both from the point of view of the business and general community, as well as the rights of the proprietor of the trademark in terms of the exploitation and use of the mark.

  This module is set against the background of the internationalisation of the flow of goods, services and capital. It studies the private law response to this development and the emergence of trans-national commercial and financial law as a new lex mercatoria to support these flows. In this context, the creation of a new legal order is discussed and the spontaneous development of an independent international normativity in it, the sources of law that become relevant in this connection and the hierarchy amongst them.
The function and approaches of official or unofficial international bodies in the formulation of industry practices, like the ICC in the Incoterms and UCP, of Unidroit and Uncitral in the formulation of uniform law like for the international sale of goods and receivable financing, or of groups of academics in the formulation of principles, like those of contract and trust law, will also be discussed. Their findings will be compared with those adopted in the US, especially in the Uniform Commercial Code.
At the academic level, this module will study the operation of the major legal systems, especially those of Common and Civil Law. At the practical level, it will consider the details especially of the modern laws of contract, sales, agency, payments, personal property, trusts, secured transactions, conditional sales, financial leases, repurchase agreements, factoring, securitizations and financial derivatives including swaps.

  In a world which is dominated by global trading and free movement of capital and investment it is very likely that insolvency proceedings will not be hermetically contained in a single jurisdiction. Large multinational companies will often conduct business via a multitude of subsidiaries and branches in a number of different jurisdictions worldwide. Thousands of shareholders and debt investors may be scattered around the world. Even small and medium sized companies may have had dealings with parties from other countries, or may own or have interests in property which is located in different jurisdictions. Liabilities may be owed to parties domiciled in a different country from that of the debtor; or the relevant obligations may be governed by foreign law; or may be due to be performed abroad. These situations give rise to complex issues in respect of conflict-of-laws as well as the substantive law of insolvency and reorganisation.
The module is set against this background. In the first part of the module important issues of substantive corporate insolvency law will be analysed on a functional and comparative basis, taking into account the laws of major Western economies (US, UK, Germany, France). Over the last decade the three European jurisdictions under consideration have substantially reformed their insolvency laws (Germany in 1999, UK in 2002, France in 2005 and again in 2008/09). Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code has in many respects influenced these reforms and facilitated the rise of the rescue culture in Europe. Accordingly, particular emphasis will be put on the law of corporate reorganisation inside as well as outside formal proceedings (workouts). Despite this remarkable trans-Atlantic convergence, substantial differences remain, not least resulting from the interaction of corporate insolvency law with other areas of law such as company law, contract law and property law. We will trace these differences and try to explain them in the light of their social and economic contexts.
In the second part, the module will focus on the national and international instruments dealing with the conflict-of-laws issues in transnational corporate insolvency and reorganisation: the European Insolvency Regulation, the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, it implementation in the UK and the US, as well as Domestic Jurisdiction in the United States. The issues of jurisdiction, recognition of foreign proceedings, judicial cooperation in concurrent proceedings and the applicable law pursuant to these instruments will be studied, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective.

  Criminal law is no longer confined to dealing with crime within national borders. Genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression carry individual responsibility under international law. Crimes such as human trafficking, piracy, drug trafficking and terrorism have cross-border effects leading to legal responses at regional and international levels. As a result domestic criminal law must increasingly take account of both international (state-to-state) and transnational (states-and-private-actors) responses to criminal activity. This module provides an in-depth understanding of international and transnational criminal law from institutional, substantive and comparative perspectives.

      Completion of a 10,000 to 12,000 word dissertation, which will satisfy the assessment requirements for this research module as well as the dissertation requirement of the LLM programme.
     
  In this module, we will focus on the structures and rules of transnational arbitration, particularly on their authorship, their implementation and revision. As we examine the differences between transnational arbitration rules and existing international as well as domestic norms, it will become apparent how private actors (including transnational businesses, arbitrators, or arbitral institutions) assume the role of transnational rule creators, policy makers and conflict resolvers. This transnationalization of dispute resolution can be shown to be part of a much larger trend of domestic law&rsquo;s transformation through privatization and delegation, while, at the same time, contributing to an ever more complex realm of global governance.
The first session will lay out the theoretical foundations for the group and present the type of research and debates that students will engage into during the module. During the four following sessions of the module, each student will be asked to write and present a short (1-2 pages long) reaction paper to scholarly works in the field of arbitration. These scholarly works will focus on the four following topics:
General Theory of Arbitration
Authority and Global Architecture
Procedure
Precedent and Appeal
Students will devote the second half of the term to the drafting of a research paper (6000 words +/- 500 words). The subject of the research paper will relate to one of the four topics set out above. Students will meet individually with the instructor to discuss their topic and ongoing research during the second half of the term. The instructor will also assist those of the students who wish to engage into archival work.
During the last session of the term, the class will meet again so that each student presents orally his/her ongoing research (in approximately 10 minutes). The final research paper will be due at the end of the exam period.

  With the globalization of corporate activity, capital movement and foreign direct investment, corporate governance has become a border-crossing concern and a contested field of debate on a global scale. At the same time, corporate governance rules and principles are increasingly being created and disseminated through a complex mixture of public, private, state and non-state based norm-making processes that involve different domestic, international and transnational actors. This module will study this fast-evolving regulatory landscape and provide students with a deeper understanding not only of the rules themselves but of the transnational political and economic conditions under which they are developing.
In the first part, the module will address different concepts of the corporation and of corporate governance from both a contemporary and historical perspective. The second part of the module will provide for a series of detailed studies of pressing issues in corporate governance regulation today by looking at both the 'hard' and the 'soft' law in these areas, including takeovers, hedge funds governance, rating agencies and corporate board composition.
The module exposes students to a variety of domestic, comparative and transnational bodies of law and norms and to a selection of cross-disciplinary debates that address the changing roles of corporate actors in a globalizing world. It is suitable for students interested in the transnationalization of corporate governance from both a practice perspective and a focus on the wider debates surrounding this lively regulatory field today.

  Transnational law enforcement is vital to the study of contemporary legal theory and practice because it concerns the everyday attempts by police and other agents to solve problems that transcend or transgress national boundaries. The rapid growth of global policing and transnational law enforcement reflects a shift in the nature of governance under conditions of globalisation. Transnational law enforcement is now a policy response to organised crime, terrorism, migration and people trafficking, financial crime, environmental crime, intellectual property theft, competition law violations, cybercrime and many other transnational legal problems. The study of policing and law enforcement practices that transcend national boundaries is a vibrant interdisciplinary field that links law with criminology, sociology, philosophy, political science and international relations. This module sets out a comprehensive analysis of the architecture and practices of law enforcement agents working above and beyond the nation-state (including the use of force, surveillance, intelligence gathering, joint investigation, mutual legal assistance, cross-border evidence collection, fugitive apprehension and rendition). The module concludes by asking how and to whom transnational law enforcement can be held accountable.
The module includes presentations from the module leader (drawing on his text Global Policing
 (Sage 2012)), student-led exposition of essential articles, plenary discussion of key issues and student-led case studies of specific law enforcement problems that interest them. The module is focused on developing students' understanding of transnational law enforcement, applying their analytical skills to multi-jurisdictional policing problems and drafting research papers. The module will be valuable to students aiming for careers in research, policy or practice in international organizations requiring a high level of analytical and writing ability and for those seeking to progress to a PhD.

  Practicing lawyers are often confronted with the limitations of having to rely on precedent or legislation when advising clients in areas of &lsquo;new&rsquo; law, or where court decisions and statutory regulations are not yet sufficiently available. While this might be due to the fact that the law &ndash; in a domestic setting &ndash; is only slowly awakening to a recently emerged regulatory problem, this governance lag is amplified in the context of transnational activities, where issues of sovereignty, jurisdiction and forum pose additional obstacles to the creation of effective legal regulation. Practically speaking, lawyers in such cases frequently resort to team work, experts, stakeholders and other relevant parties &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo;, eventually shifting their strategy from litigation to a combination of legal consultancy, advocacy, coalition building and even public awareness building. This type of lawyering requires considerable flexibility, competences and resources, which are not readily available to every lawyer. From a theoretical perspective, the lawyer might find herself overwhelmed by what can be the technical or cognitive as well as the moral complexity of the case setting she is working on.
At the centre of the module is the shift away from training lawyers in learning and interpreting the law primarily through the study of jurisprudence (case law as in the common law tradition) or through the interpretation of statutory law (legislation &ndash; civil law tradition). Instead, students are invited to take on the perspective of the lawyer/advocate/activist who is involved in &lsquo;building&rsquo; a case from a set of diverse, inchoate and constantly evolving facts and data. This reversal of perspective is a crucial element in confronting students as future practitioners with the real-world challenges of an effective access to justice.
Assuming the position of legal practice and rights advocacy, students immerse themselves into a case from the &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; by identifying and negotiating the affected and involved interests, finding and navigating the applicable law, including, possibly, 'soft' law, codes of conduct, social norms etcetera, and developing a legal interest representation strategy (&ldquo;LIRS&rdquo;). In contrast to giving legal advice to a client in a more or less confined and concrete legal question regarding, for example; liability, entitlement, conviction or acquittal, the development of a LIRS might include a variety of avenues, including, but not limited to, designing a litigation or defence strategy, the enhancing of legal and political rights, engaging in coalition and public awareness building or contributing to a sustainable stakeholder interest representation process.

  This module is concerned with the control of private economic power through the competition laws in the UK. Those laws are contained primarily in the Competition Act 1998 (as amended) and the Enterprise Act 2002. The landscape for competition law enforcement in the United Kingdom has changed out of all recognition in the last few years. Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty are directly applicable in the UK, and, in certain circumstances, the domestic authorities and national courts are obliged to apply them. However, there is also a substantial body of competition case-law and decisional practice in the UK.
The purpose of this module is to consider the rationale, scope and application of the Chapter I and II prohibitions in the Competition Act 1998 (which broadly correspond to the Articles 101 and 102 EU). It will also examine distinct features of UK competition law, including concurrent enforcement by sector-specific regulators of the Competition Act 1998 and market investigation references, the domestic merger control regime, super-complaints, and the criminal cartel offence under the Enterprise Act.
No previous knowledge of the subject is required.
The module is taught in weekly seminars; you are encouraged to actively engage with the issues being addressed.
There is a three and a quarter hour open book examination at the end of the year. Examples of recent examination papers will be available on King&rsquo;s School of Law Intranet.

  Module description
This module examines the US federal antitrust laws, the world's oldest sophisticated competition regime. You study the core antitrust provisions, chart the evolution of the law and examine the different factors which have led the law to its current provisions. The module introduces the laws, their objectives and the enforcement system prior to considering how they apply to horizontal and vertical agreements and unilateral conduct. No previous knowledge of the subject is required.
The module is taught in seminars; you are encouraged to actively engage with the issues being addressed.

  Value Added Tax is an increasingly important tax in the UK and throughout the EU. Not only does it generate a large amount of revenue for governments, its character as a European tax makes for interesting case law and controversy within domestic systems.
This module considers the nature of VAT as a tax and considers the system of VAT as implemented in the UK. It considers the various elements of the tax and how the tax has developed in response to EU movement and pressure.
As well as gaining a comprehensive understanding of VAT in the UK, the aim of the module is to provide you with the tools to be able to comprehend other systems of VAT in Europe and also to understand why what seems like a simple tax has proved so complicated in the EU.

  The premise of this module is that world trade law, as a specific sector of international economic law, is developing so rapidly and is increasingly occupying such a central role in international law that it merits separate treatment in a full LLM subject. The study of the subject will focus on the law of the World Trade Organization, within several contexts: political, economic, other instruments and rules of international law-making, and jurisprudential. As such, the study of world trade law will be a lens through which the role and position of law in the evolution of globalisation can be looked at and analysed. By learning to use that lens you will at once acquire practical legal knowledge and a firm conceptual framework of analysis.
The module looks at the various areas of WTO law, including institutions, dispute settlement, essential GATT principles, the TBT and SPS Agreements, trade protection, trade in services, intellectual property protection, treatment of developing countries, and constitutional issues such as the relationship with other international law and with domestic law.
