STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   There are five modules that must all be completed in order to achieve the MSc:
Understanding Affective Disorders
Causes and Correlates of Affective Disorders
Challenges in Treating Affective Disorders
Research Methods   Statistics for Studying Affective Disorders
Research Project on Affective Disorders

     
   
   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  The first three modules comprise lectures, seminars, and practical workshops. They are assessed by a written exam (MCQs, abstract writing, or short answer questions), a piece of coursework (traditional, grant application style, or care plan), and seminar participation (e.g. presentation).

The fourth module comprises lectures and practical lab classes. It is assessed by an exam, the writing of a research protocol, and attendance.
The dissertation module is assessed by a research report, lab notebook and poster presentation.

  The main aim of this module is to provide students a detailed evaluation of the many possible causes that have been linked to the development of affective disorders, as well as present measurable indicators that are used to evaluate risk adn follow treatment. The module will comprise a combination of lectures, which will cover main research milestones and findings, and seminars, which will examine specific areas of research in greater detail and encourage critical thinking about the current state of the field. This approach will allow the students to navigate this complex emergent field of study; develop critical appraisal of its crucial elements; and generate and discuss ideas for future research.

  This module provides students with an exciting and rich set of lectures and workshops on the challenges faced in diagnosing, treating and managing affective disorders, both at the individual level, and at the service implementation level. Students will be taken on a tour, starting from the patient perspective, through the clinical needs that service providers are faced with, ending with the national policies and international guidelines that need to be addressed. They will acquire knowledge of the range of treatments available, and be exposed to practical illustrations of how the latest research findings are applied in pragmatic clinical settings. They will also acquire skills in the reasoning processes that need to be applied when choosing the most appropriate form of treatment. Thereby, sstudents will develop a solid and critical understanding of the wisdom on treating and manageing affective disorders that will enable them to tackle the future clinical and research challenges in this field.

  This module aims to provide students with a solid foundation in the key research methods used in mental health research, together with practical knowledge of the fundamental statistical methods used to analyse such research. In these classes, research methods will be critically appraised in context, with a view to helping students establish the most appropriate methods for a given research question. Regarding statistical analyses, students will be instructed not only in what analysis techniques to use in certain circumstances, but also how to implement them using available statistical software, and how to interpret the results. Procedural regulations and guidelines for mental health research will additionally be covered, including how to seek the approvals necessary to conduct research in this fiels. Thereby, students will develop the skills set necessary to conduct their own piece of mental health research for their MSc dissertation.

  This module will provide students with the practical skills necessary to conduct a piece of research on a chosen topic within the field of Affective Disorders. This hands-on experience will empower students to make their own contribution to this burgeoning field of research, under the guidance of internationally remowned scientists from the Centre for Affective Disorders. This stimulating experience will be of direct benefit not only to those students who work in a clinical context but do not have prior research experience, but also to those students who wish to progress to a full-time career in research or continue toward further clinical studies. Suitable topics for this dissertation module range from understanding the science related to affective disorders, to using this knowledge to help develop new treatments of all types, including psychological and pharmacological.

  This module aims to provife students with an exciting and rich set of lectures and workshops on the history, risk factors and disease burden, diagnosis, and assessment of affective disorders. Students will be taken on a journey starting with classification of affective disorders in ancient Greece and ending in modern controversies surrounding the US diagnostic statistical manual.  
They will acquire skills in using gold standard instruments of assessment of affective disorders and how to transfer these skills into a pragmatic clinical setting. They will also acquire skills in high-quality clinical assessment of affective disorders as refined by generations of psychiatrists and psychologists building on the seminal work of Karl Jaspers in the early 20th century. Thereby, students will develop a solid and critical understanding of the past wisdom on affective disorders that will enable them to tackle the future clinical and research challenges in this field.
