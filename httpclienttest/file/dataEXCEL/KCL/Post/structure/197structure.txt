  This module is about the question of what is entailed in taking a &lsquo;scientific approach&rsquo; to the study of social   political relations, with particular reference to International Relations (IR) and International Political Economy (IPE). This is not an entirely straightforward aim since social &lsquo;science&rsquo; is an essentially contested field. This has implications for research methods. Above all, methods cannot be separated from contestable assumptions about ontology (the nature of social reality) and epistemology (the nature and status of knowledge that we can have about this reality). Even those who assert that 'facts speak for themselves' do so from the point of view of particular ontological and epistemological assumptions!
At the same time, amidst this uncertainty, social scientists have to get on with their research. Given the contested and contestable nature of social science, we cannot provide a 'master solution' for this practice. Rather, this module seeks to teach students how to reflect on the merits and limitations of different forms of social-political analysis and methodology as revealed in debates in the literature about ontology and epistemology. This is so that students can choose and motivate their own approach in a reflexive and informed manner.
Hence, this module provides postgraduate students with a critical introduction to the practices and controversies of contemporary social-political analysis and to their relevance to substantive research in IR and IPE. The module identifies and critically assesses the premises behind the methodological choices social scientists make and their implications. The module begins by considering debates about the nature of the political and debates in the philosophy of social science upon which the issues ultimately hinge. These debates are then explored in more detail with reference to central ontological themes: agency and structure; the material and the ideational; power; and temporality and change. The final section of the module critically assesses social-theoretical research traditions that are central to IR and IPE, ranging from rational choice theory to postmodernism.

  This module explores the relationship between the political and the economic as two closely interrelated, interdependent and co-shaping domains. Their intersection generates conflicts, contradictions and tensions that this course will aim to unpack by developing a critical examination of key concepts within the field of political economy. Topics covered include Exploitation, Ideology, States, Hegemony, Finance, Crisis, and Resistance.

  Economic integration remains at the core of what the EU is and why it exists. Today it constitutes the largest and most integrated single market in the world. But how is it governed? The module sets out to explore the development, structures and policies that characterise economic integration &ndash; in particular, the single market, monetary union, economic and fiscal coordination, employment and social policy, and cohesion policy. Drawing on theories of European integration, political economy and comparative politics, it analyses the distinctive &lsquo;modes&rsquo; of governance that the EU employs in these different policy fields &ndash; from &lsquo;hard&rsquo; supranational policy making through to &lsquo;soft&rsquo; informal coordination and learning. The course concludes by addressing two fundamental issues. Firstly, what are the democratic implications of economic union without political union, and is this sustainable or desirable? Secondly, what has been the impact of the global financial crisis on economic governance, and how can the EU respond to it? The module therefore seeks to provide a clearer understanding of how and why the EU shapes our lives to a greater extent than ever before.

  The module commences with a review of the theories of international trade and key policy issues affecting the world trading system since the creation of the GATT in 1947 and subsequently the WTO in 1995. The overarching focus is on trade protection and trade liberalization through an examination to a number of bilateral and regional trade arrangements across the Middle East and how these arrangements affected the economic development of the region. The module gives students the opportunity to debate the challenges facing inter-Arab trade relations, including regional and sub-regional groupings such as the Greater inter-Arab Free Trade Area, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Agadir Agreement. Key policy issues such as dumping and antidumping, intra-industry trade, trade creation and trade diversion are examined. Trade relations between the Middle East and major trading partners, including the European Union, and the United States, are analysed in the context of broad policy frameworks such as the Barcelona Process. Turkey&rsquo;s customs union with the EU and the GCC trade relations with China, India and Japan are also explored.
The module is expected to provide students with an understanding of current international trade flows and trade policies, and allow them to appreciate and participate in the debates and discussions that constantly rage in this area in the Middle Eastern contextthrough detailed case studies. It will also provide students with the tools to address the theoretical approaches underpinning the development of foreign trade policies and institutions, as well as the analytical, research, presentation and writing skills that are essential for employability and marketplace.

  This module invites students to investigate the material and ideological structures underpinning the edifice of global economic governance. This means paying attention to the key international organisations and the ways in which they have been transformed since their creation, but also to the increasing role of private institutions and authorities in the management of the global economy. The module begins by introducing students to the key conceptual and theoretical issues that have preoccupied global governance scholars for some time, followed by a brief historical recollection that allows the students to familiarise themselves with the historical roots of the current global governance structures. It then proceeds to examine the governance in key issue-areas of global economy, such as finance, trade, knowledge, labour and the environment, paying attention not only to the relevant international organizations, but also to the material and ideological elements that underpin the governance of these issue-areas, as well as the key state and non-state actors within them.

  This module offers a theoretical overview of current debates about the nature and origins of globalisation and examines various aspects of the economics of global capital along with their social and political consequences. The geopolitical reconfiguration ushered in by the collapse of the Eastern Bloc will be examined in relation to the crisis of Western liberalism and the emergence of new forms of resistance to globalisation. Do such movements represent defensive &lsquo;resistance identities&rsquo; or an attempt to create new public spaces and new forms of community? The module will conclude with an assessment of the extent to which the existing literature on social movements is able to respond to such questions, followed by an examination of alternative societal models to global capitalism. Students will develop their analytical skills in coming to terms with a wide-ranging contemporary debate which engages with various key theoretical issues in the fields of economics, sociology and political science.

  The module will introduce students to the basic theoretical, historical and geopolitical contours of political economy of oil and gas today as an essential dimension of contemporary international political economy. To this aim, the module is divided into three segments. The first is devoted to the historical rise of oil and later gas as two critical natural resources shaping the prospects of the world economy. The second leg of the module will analyse the political economy of oil and gas in more detail, looking at the main theoretical perspectives which explain the shifts in their demand and supply, the changes in their prices, their specific weight on world economy today and various questions related to the contemporary Oil and Gas markets. The third and final segment of the module analyses the main contemporary geopolitical make-up of the oil and gas order, focussing in on the question of oil and gas as international strategic commodities, and the uneven geographies of their trade routes.

  This module is designed to provide a general overview of the fundamental concepts, processes and theoretical takes in Economics for students of International Political Economy. The general rationale of the module is to give our IPE students, who will be acquainting themselves with the general contours of economic and political power in the contemporary international system, the option of getting a firmer grasp on the fundamental theoretical toolkit for the analysis of contemporary economic relations. To this end, the module covers some basic but essential elements in microeconomics and macroeconomics, before moving on to critically analyse the most important dimensions of the international economic relations, ensuing from any country&rsquo;s interaction with the outer world: trade and trade policy, international factor movement and the global division of labour, current account imbalances, exchange rates and exchange rate volatility or international money and banking and currency crises. The module is designed to act as a general and thorough introduction to the theoretical analysis of these aspects of the international political economy, and as such does not require any prior knowledge of economic theory or assume any previous mathematical training, beyond basic arithmetic abilities. In order to fulfil these aims, the module is articulated in two main parts:principles of micro-economics, introducing to the concepts of the market, demand and supply, elasticity theory and market structures (perfect competition and forms of imperfect competition).
principles of macro-economics, dealing with national accounting, aggregate demand and the Keynesian approach; the problem of inflation and the Monetarist approach; the IS/LM model and the Hicksian synthesis; the Mundell-Fleming model; and the three final sessions concentrating on trade and trade policy, currency markets, international banking and exchange rates, and labour mobility and the international division of labour.

  The focus of this module is on the representation of interests in the European Union and their role in EU policy-making. Member States and EU institutions are not the only influential actors in European Union policy-making. A number of other organized interests make their presence felt &ndash; usually behind the scenes &ndash; in EU politics and policies. These actors range from pan-European trade associations and regional governments to lawyers, consultants, and multinational companies. Their presence increased with the expansion of responsibilities and membership of the European Union. The module examines the nature of organised interests in the EU and why their influence as lobbyists has increased over time in the EU policy-making process. The module also considers how the EU institutions have responded to lobbying &ndash; a process which is now an integral part of EU decision-making.

  The module focuses on the changing fortunes of the welfare state by concentrating on three main areas/themes. The first set of seminars look at macro-economic conditions and different national variants of welfare state development in Europe. The second block of seminars deal with the crisis of the welfare state resulting from globalisation processes and the rising dominance of neoliberal policies. Pressures for retrenchment and recalibration are investigated, based on different theoretical approaches to crisis analysis. The third group of seminars uses the new social risks approach, which stresses challenges such as the reconciliation of work and family life and the &lsquo;problem&rsquo; of low skills in a knowledge-based economy. While traditional welfare systems are mainly shaped by national policy action, the new risks agenda is heavily influenced by the EU. Thus, the module analyses both nation states&rsquo; and the EU&rsquo;s involvement in welfare provisioning, using political economy approaches.

  Bright ideas do not necessarily make good research. It is equally wrong to assume that data speak for themselves, thus constituting a sufficient condition for conducting research in social sciences. Rather, bright ideas and sound evidence are better conceived as necessary but not sufficient conditions for conducting high-quality research in social science. Within this context, research methods can be seen as the bridge allowing to link theoretical considerations and empirical material, sometimes pushing the researcher to downscale her ambitions, some others opening up unforeseen avenues for research. Starting from this consideration on the role of methods in social sciences, this module aims to provide students with a thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the main research methods they are likely to employ when conducting research in social science.
The module is structured into two parts, focusing respectively on the key debates in the philosophy of social science and on the discussion of the main research methods, with a final two-hour workshop at the end of the module where students are asked to think through the methodological components of their end-of-year dissertation.

  The relationship between the EU and Asia is one of the key drivers of developments in the international system. Whereas in the past relations between these two regions were driven by economics, today political and security calculations are equally central to understand the dynamics of their interactions. This module addresses the relationship between the EU and Asia by looking at their relations at the regional level, as well as by analysing bilateral relations between the EU and key Asian countries. Particular attention will be given to how developments in the international system affect EU-Asia interactions and to how these interactions impact international relations. Special emphasis will also be put on the role of the USA in shaping the EU&rsquo;s and Asian countries&rsquo; respective policies towards each other.

  At least formally, Britain&rsquo;s membership in the European Union is a fraught one. At the same time, there are few states that have been as committed to integrated world market as the British one and the European Union forms an important part of this commitment. This module is about understanding the nature of the relationship between Britain and the EU, how this has endured or changed over time, and what the determinants of this relationship might be.

  East Asia is one of the most economically dynamic regions in the world. A mixture of developed, emerging and developing countries offer a vibrant and complex economic environment. China, the world's second biggest economy, is at the centre of this dynamism. This module addresses the economic, political and social factors behind developments in the economy of East Asia, with particular attention to the issue-areas of trade, money and finance, and development and aid, as well as to the central role played by China. Particular attention will be given to the evolution of East Asia's political economy as a result of the transformation of the Japanese economy from the 1950s onwards, the introduction of the Chinese economic reforms of the late 1970s, and the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. Special emphasis will also be put on the role that the Chinese and East Asian economies play in the international economic system, as well as on the politico-economic relationship between East Asia and the United States and the European Union.

  This module focuses on the actors and issues that have defined development theory and practice previously and that continue to define contemporary development. The module will introduce students to the controversies that have been generated by discussions and debates about development from the emergence of the concept/practice onwards. It aims to place development as theory and practice in a historical perspective, paying particular attention both to its often forgotten beginnings and recent challenges to received &lsquo;development wisdom&rsquo; coming from feminist, environmental and postmodernist quarters, as well as from profound shifts observable in practice, e.g. the rise of BRICs countries.

  The theoretical aim of the module is, first, to understand the problem of migration, both legal and illegal, in the context of globalisation; and, second, to assess the relation between globalisation, marginalisation and the EU response to threats of mass immigration from less developed countries. The Unit therefore focuses on the following theoretical questions:
How is the process of globalisation related to the increase of migratory flows from less developed countries to Western ones?
What are the main political and economic causes and consequences of migration, in general, and illegal migration, in particular?
Is there tension between legal and illegal migration?

  The financial crisis that started 2007 in the American subprime mortgage market casts a long shadow over the global political economy, and no doubt its future will be marked by the management of this crisis. But understanding the crisis and its consequences is far from straightforward, and requires careful consideration of history and competing analytical frameworks as offered by this module. Concluding sessions draw on such understanding to assess current crisis management at the global level and in the Eurozone.

  The United States has become the pre-eminent power in an area that stretches from the western Mediterranean to central Asia. Americans have had an enduring fascination with the region beginning with the arrival of missionaries on Middle Eastern shores in the 19th century, but it is only relatively recently&mdash;slightly more than 50 years&mdash;in which Washington has become an important political actor in the region. The goal of this course is to examine and explain the determinants of U.S. involvement in the Middle East. In order to ground the subject matter in firm analytical foundations, the course applies general concepts and theories of international politics to illuminate Washington&rsquo;s role in the region.
The module begins with an introduction to historic US intervention   mediation in the Middle East region. It then proceeds to look at the involvement of the United States in the Middle East in the Cold war and the post-Cold War eras. It will look at America&rsquo;s bilateral relations with key regional players including Israel/Palestine, Iraq and Iran. It will also examine Washington as an intervening power throughout the region, its role in facilitating Arab-Israeli peacemaking since the 1970s, and its reaction to the Arab Spring.
