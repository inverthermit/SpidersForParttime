  The aim of the course is to bring you into critical engagement with biblical texts through a range of commentaries from a variety of periods reflecting a wide range of hermeneutical approaches. You will develop not only an awareness of your own hermeneutical assumptions when approaching the text, but also an 'intellectual empathy' for approaches that are not your own. Beyond this, you will learn how to analyse and evaluate the various exegetical methods employed, to negotiate between conflicting interpretations and to reflect on the hermeneutical issues that arise.

  This module is devoted to the study of the passion narratives of the canonical Gospels (with some attention to the non-canonical Gospels) and their reception within creative media. Initially there will be a focus on the texts, as well as the social, political, historical and archaeological background relevant to the debates concerning the death of Jesus. Following this, the second part of the course will be an examination and analysis of the representation of the passion in art, literature and film. Students will explore how the passion of Jesus has been utilised and depicted in a variety of artistic, literary and cinematic productions. This will be done through individual student presentations. The presentation will consist of a summary of work in progress towards a final essay on a specific topic chosen from a selection of options. Classes will be seminar style with a strong emphasis on student participation. Class sessions will focus on:

set texts from the passion narratives of the four Gospels, which students will be expected to have studied in advance using appropriate commentaries and other relevant secondary literature;
teaching sessions, mainly concerning relevant history and archaeology; and
student presentations, which ideally should involve a visual component

There will be a strong emphasis on discussion and evaluation.

  The module will teach students about the sustained and rich discussion of the theme of the beautiful in the Western Church, a discussion which runs through every century of its history and has often provoked fierce contention (as in the Reformation). It will introduce students to this tradition, tracing its debts to classical models of the relationsihp between beauty and goodness (especially in the works of Plotinus), through the medieval discussions of beauty as a transcendental (especially in the work of Aquinas), to the theological influence on philosophical aesthetics in the 18th and 19th centuries (including the observation of a distinctively British tradition in Coleridge, Ruskin, Hopkins and others). It will conclude with the major works in the area of theological aesthetics that have been produced since the 20th century (Jacques Maritain, David, Jones, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Davie Bentley Hart, Rowan Williams). The module will encourage students to judge the status of 'aesthetics' as a theological locus, and to relate the philosophical and theological discussions they encounter to actual works of art.
