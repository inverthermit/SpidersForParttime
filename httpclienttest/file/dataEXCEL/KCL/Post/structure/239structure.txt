      Advanced Skills For The Medical Humanities - Required

  The aim of this module is to offer instruction in the practical skills necessary to develop as Medical Humanities scholars, everything from how to read a set of medical case notes to using archives of texts and illustrated sources. The course is intended to complement the core course, Themes in the Medical Humanities, and it is envisaged that each skills session will last an hour each week and will take place before the core course two-hour seminars. The use of archives is a complex matter and a number of sessions have been set aside for it. Likewise, the writing of a dissertation may come easier to candidates who have the benefit of a humanities training than those with a science background so 6 hours have been set aside for dissertation writing workshops.

  The chief educational aim of this course is to explore the foundations of this field by asking questions that are often begged: Does studying the humanities make us more humane? How are the humanities different from the sciences? What is health? What is illness? What kind of evidence does literature provide? What is narrative and how embedded are narrative ways of thought and representation in medicine? This course starts from the assumption that the questions Medical Humanities scholars ask are best addressed from specific humanities disciplines. 

Through sustained exposure to the way a variety of humanities disciplines addresses questions such as those outlined above, students will learn methods for undertaking Medical Humanities research of their own. The second aim is to introduce students to the different ways these questions appear from the standpoint of humanities&rsquo; disciplines and the standpoint of healthcare. The third aim is to familiarise students with some of the main themes and topics of Medical Humanities research. Finally, the course will introduce students to a range of research resources (archival as well as bibliographic) necessary for the study of the Medical Humanities.

  Half-module

Taught by: Professor Rosamund Scott

This module addresses the law relating to assisted reproduction and the embryo, primarily in England   Wales. You explore the law on assisted reproduction and surrogacy and consider legitimate uses of the embryo beyond the reproductive sphere, studying embryo research / stem cell research / therapeutic cloning. These themes are united by the fact that the latter activities may stem from the embryos created but not used in medically assisted reprodution. You also consider some key underlying ethical issues.

  Half-module

Taught by: Professor Rosamund Scott

This module covers aspects of the law relating to reproduction in England and Wales and in selected other jurisdictions, and some key ethical issues underlying the law. You consider the scope of the legal interest in having a child, or in avoiding reproduction or in deciding about the kind of child one may have. You explore the law relating to abortion, prenatal diagnosis, wrongful birth, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, wrongful life, wrongful conception and the sterilisation of someone who is mentally disabled.

  Half-module

Taught by: Professor Penney Lewis

The question whether assisted dying should be legalised is often treated as one which transcends diverse legal systems. As a result, the important context in which individual jurisdictions make decisions about assisted dying and the significance of the legal methods chosen to carry out those decisions is often lost. You study the legal regulation of assisted dying in a wide range of jurisdictions, including those which permit some form(s) of assisted dying and those in which legalisation attempts has been unsuccessful.

  This course is intended to complement the course in &ldquo;Literature and Psychiatry from Locke to Freud&rdquo; that the convenors already offer via the Literature and Medicine MA. It may run on alternate years with this precursor course or it may supersede the latter entirely. Its primary aim is to explore the explicit representation of psychiatry and psychiatric theory in twentieth-century literature and film. (Thus, this is not a course in the psycho-analytic interpretation of literary texts.) Although psycho-analysis has had the most profound impact on the representation of psychiatry and of mental disorder more generally in twentieth-century European culture, the course will examine a broad range of representations of psychiatrists and psychiatry (early twentieth-century neurology, psycho-analysis, anti-psychiatry, psychiatry based on developments in clinical pharmacology from the 1950s onwards, and evolutionary psychology). It will pay special attention to late twentieth-century depictions of psychiatry before 1920.

  This module offers an introduction to the role of discourse in health, illness and medical practice. Discourse analysis explores social life through the analysis of language in its widest sense (including verbal interaction, non-verbal, images, symbols, documents). In this module, we will study genres of language including case reports, scientific papers, drug advertisements and media health stories, as well as interaction in consultations. There will be a particular focus on introducing students to relevant methods in the study of medical discourses.
  
    Moral Theory And Medical Ethics - Optional

  An important module if you are interested in the moral issues which arise in the context of medical practice and medical law. An introduction to the major theories provides you with a theoretical framework for the analysis of a range of complex problems in medical ethics. You develop a critical awareness of the principles and doctrines operating and learn to apply them in a systematic and creative way to some of the most difficult issues facing the medical profession today.
This module is a pre-requisite for all other modules on the programme.
