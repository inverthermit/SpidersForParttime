  This module enables students to undertake a substantial written project relevant to their field of practice. Students draw on learning and skills acquired in the taught components of the MSc programme. The module offers a choice of one of three options: an analysis of an area of healthcare provision, an empirical study, or a systematic review.
Students are supported in their project work through guidance from a designated supervisor. Additionally, all students, once enrolled, have access to group online tutorials via discussion boards situated within the module e-Learning site. The online discussion boards provide a medium where queries can be addressed and suggestions offered by both fellow students and the module leader.
