  Core programme content
   Measurement and Evaluation for Healthcare Practice
Evidence Based Decision Making in Healthcare
Dissertation

For students wishing to undertake an empirical study as part of the dissertation module, an additional module entitled Issues in the Conduct of Healthcare Research must be taken and passed.
Alternatively students may choose for their dissertation to undertake an indepth analysis of an area of policy or practice or to prepare three papers for publication.
PLEASE NOTE: Core modules (see below) can only run with a minimum of 12 students.

     
   Indicative non-core content
   Students select optional courses from a wide range of available options including:
Advanced assessment skills
Clinical specialities

For full details of all the options available please click here.

Other options from our BSc programme may also be available. Students who have already studied clinically-focused modules at undergraduate or graduate level at King's may be able to incorporate this study into the programme, subject to certain limits, provided that the credits have not already contributed to an award. Modules studied elsewhere may be incorporated through accreditation of prior certificated learning (subject to a successful accreditation claim
).  
     
   
   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  This programme is part-time with taught sessions comprising a mixture of one day per week attendance and study blocks. Students select from modules rated at 15 or 30 credits. Students may elect to undertake one or more practice portfolios where practice accounts are used to demonstrate specialist or advanced practice.

  This module enables students to undertake a substantial written project relevant to their field of practice. Students draw on learning and skills acquired in the taught components of the MSc programme. The module offers a choice of one of three options: an analysis of an area of healthcare provision, an empirical study, or a systematic review.
Students are supported in their project work through guidance from a designated supervisor. Additionally, all students, once enrolled, have access to group online tutorials via discussion boards situated within the module e-Learning site. The online discussion boards provide a medium where queries can be addressed and suggestions offered by both fellow students and the module leader.

  This course aims to equip you with the skills and knowledge required to identify best evidence for your practice. It focuses on searching for, appraising and synthesising evidence from health care research. You are introduced to a range of electronic databases for accessing evidence and the principles of systematic review. Learning is facilitated through lectures, workshops and a student-directed search for evidence to address a question emerging from your own practice. Issues surrounding research implementation and evidence at the level of the individual practitioner and the health care organisation are addressed. Assessment is by means of a review of literature which answers a focussed question utilising explicit methods.

  This module aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of the key research approaches and techniques used in healthcare research. It intends to promote students&rsquo; understanding of published articles and enhance skills of critical analysis and enhance skills for critiquing research articles. Further it aims to promote the development of skills required to undertake a research-based project in the future. This module is a good stepping stone to Master's level work for those who have studied research methods at level 6 and those who would benefit from revision of this knowledge. It will consider philosophical bases for research, traditions and features of qualitative and quantitative research designs, data collection tools used in qualitative and quantitative research and analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. This module is a precursor for the second research methods module, &lsquo;Issues in the Conduct of Healthcare Research&rsquo;

  This course aims to raise awareness of issues that arise inthe conduct of research, from writing research proposals to the publication of findings. It will be useful for students embarking on a research or service development project, for new   researchers wishing to develop their skills, and for healthcare professionals seeking to evaluate healthcare services. Issues covered in the course include gaining funding, managing research schedules, involving users in the research process, working with external agencies, addressing ethical and political issues in research, and managing aspects of the data collection process - for example overcoming poor response rates and managing group dynamics in focus group research. Learning is facilitated through lectures, recommended reading and seminars. The seminars provide a series of How to... sessions that facilitate application of concepts learnt during the Principal Methods for Healthcare Research course. For example: How to develop an interview schedule, or How to run a focus group. These seminars enable students to gain a practical understanding of the research process.
