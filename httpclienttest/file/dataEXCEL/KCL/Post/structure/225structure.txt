  This course explores, in international and historical perspective, the development of &lsquo;public services&rsquo;, the past and present role of the public sector in their delivery, and the development of new ideas about how best to manage the production and financing of these services. Particular attention is paid to the rise of &lsquo;New Public Management&rsquo; and quasi-market approaches; to the role of market failure, principal-agent relationships, trust and professionalism; and to institutional governance.
Sessions will explore and evaluate the extent to which policy alternatives can be generalised to the public services as a whole, as opposed to being service- or country-specific.

  This 20 credit module is designed to introduce students to the study of the policy-making process and the role of policy analysis. It aims to give a comprehensive survey of the key literature, themes and issues in the study of policy making, first by critically examining the ideas of the 'policy cycle' and its several 'stages', secondly by considering the roles of key actors and thirdly by examining the processes of agenda-building, policy 'framing' and the translation of policy into action. The second part of the course takes these themes forward through a series of case studies.
