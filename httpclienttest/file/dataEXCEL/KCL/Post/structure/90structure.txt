  The concept of play has undergone significant transformation in the past two decades in the light of new and emerging forms of work, organisation, management, and economic practice. Today, at the same time that the video game has joined literature and cinema as a dominant commercial media form, play and work blur into each other in increasingly complex ways. This course invites students to consider both the ways in which literature and critical theory have engaged with the concept of play and the ways in which games (and especially video games) represent and respond to contemporary culture.
NB: while familiarity with video games in general, and with the listed games specifically, is beneficial for this module, it is not essential. The module is predominantly concerned with the relationship between play, history, and culture, and is led by reading and discussion. The course thus represents an opportunity to develop familiarity with the cultural valences of play through literary texts and critical theory, as well as evaluations of games of all types (including non-digital and non-rule based games).

  Modernity &ldquo;is cut off from the past and continually hurtling forward at such a dizzy pace that it cannot take root &hellip; it merely survives from one day to the next.&rdquo; (Octavio Paz)
This module reflects upon the ways in which technologies and theories of speed and acceleration have interacted with artistic form and style to create new aesthetic and political possibilities. It will use a diverse cross-period selection of texts, technologies, and media to explore the developments and transformations in our understanding of 'the new' since the 19th century.
Critical thinkers we will read include Henri Bergson, Walter Benjamin, Marshall Berman, Felipo Marinetti, Le Corbusier, Friedrich A Kittler, Paul Virilio, Bruno Latour and others. Rejecting the idea that speed or acceleration must necessarily be unidirectional, the module explores instead the unevenness of different &lsquo;modernities&rsquo; and asks challenging questions about subjectivity and situation.
This is not a period-based module and it moves between 19th, 20th and 21st centuries in a deliberate attempt to build up an archaeology of the challenges of technology to culture, style and ways of being in the world over a long period and in both Europe and America. Students interested in the contemporary will be equally as interested as students whose focus is the past.
This module aims to explore with students a theoretical debate which is still developing around the impacts of technology on our culture, our bodies and our ways of understanding ourselves and our relationship to our environment.

  In 1950s America, comics were so associated with juvenile delinquency that a special comic book code, similar to the Hayes code for Hollywood films, was instituted to protect youth from their supposedly nefarious influence. But in 1986, what was once considered the most demotic and childish of forms burst into high-art prominence with Art Spiegelman&rsquo;s Maus: A Survivor&rsquo;s Tale, a memoir about the author&rsquo;s father, a Holocaust survivor. Spiegelman&rsquo;s achievement was not so much that he displaced the lowbrow associations of comics as that he made those associations resonate in complex and wrenching ways with the seriousness of his subject matter. In so doing, Spiegelman drew critical attention to a new form of comics native to the postmodern moment: glossily produced, expensive forms of graphic narrative, or what many now call the &lsquo;graphic novel&rsquo; form.
The course will examine the precursors of the graphic novel and some of its most sophisticated recent incarnations in terms of the historical conditions of their creation and reception; the specific poetics of comics as an aesthetic form; and the relation between comics&rsquo; historical belonging and their aesthetic particularity. We will attend to the differing contexts in which comics are produced and consider the parallel but distinct development of the British and American contemporary comics traditions. We will also consider comics&rsquo; location in a cultural moment that includes a bewildering new variety of image/text/narrative conjunctions, from video games to digital fictions to memes. Ultimately, we will aim to contribute to the emerging methodology for graphic novel study, both by evaluating existing criticism and by developing theoretical approaches equal to the intricate relationships contemporary graphic narratives create between text and image, frame and page, motion and stillness, time and space.
