  The study of early modern history at graduate level requires students to acquire important insights and skills that they may not have encountered in their undergraduate degrees. With the coming of printing and the increasing complexity of social and cultural interaction that it made possible, the quantity of sources expanded exponentially. The gradual breakdown of the Church in Protestant Europe and the demise of Latin as the language of government during this period means that the linguistic and palaeographic skills required of historians become more complex. This compulsory module introduces students to the various approaches to writing the history of early modern Europe and to the specific skills required to research early modern topics. Students will be expected to prepare reading for every session and to play an active part in all discussions, for example by preparing short papers as appropriate.

  Early modern bodies were defined by their social and cultural contexts. Medical discourse, moral reform, popular culture and collective identities shaped a distinctively pre-modern body, made up of humours and fluxes, mutable and sometimes magical. This module brings together perspectives from social, cultural, medical and gender history, together with a range of original sources, to examine the relationship between bodies and their social and cultural context and to consider the changes that went towards the making of the modern body in Britain and Europe between 1500 and 1750. Topics will include popular medicine; the invention of homosexuality; social discipline; sexual knowledge and reproduction.

  This module brings together two of the most lively and innovative areas of early modern historical studies, the &ldquo;new British history&rdquo;, and the history of political ideas. It offers students the opportunity to explore how power, identity and politics were conceptualized in the English speaking world during a period of social and economic change. The &ldquo;long eighteenth century&rdquo; experienced the beginnings of industrialization and population growth, the emergence of a class society, the erosion of the monopoly exercised by the established church over religious life, and the spread of mass literacy. It was also the period when the modern British State was consolidated and a colonial empire assembled across the Atlantic. Finally, the rise of Grub Street and the emergence of a popular press, facilitated by the lapse of the Licensing Act in 1695, made London the largest centre of print culture, pamphleteering and political journalism in the world.
The module involves studies, at an advanced level, of the debates surrounding the revolutions in 1688, 1776 and 1789, the unions of 1707 and 1801, and the growth of commerce and &ldquo;politeness&rdquo;. It will also involve an introduction to specialised methodological issues. Students will be introduced to two areas of methodological debate. The contextual approach favoured by Dunn, Pocock and Skinner, which focuses on the vocabularies or languages available to political writers, had to establish itself against an older school characterised by the abstract exploration of a canon of key texts. Recently it has also defended itself against the more radical challenges presented by the linguistic turn. Meanwhile, advocates of the new British history have attacked Anglo-centricity and attempted to study the interactions of the various peoples, nations and states within the &ldquo;Atlantic archipelago&rdquo; and their extension to North America. Whilst the reaction to their work has been mixed, there is no doubt that they have forced scholars to question the categories and frameworks that have shaped British historical research since the nineteenth century.

  The purpose of this course is to study the process of European expansion and its impact on the definition of ethnic prejudices, hierarchies of peoples and race relations. We will study the both the reflection in Europe on different peoples of the world resulting from the Oceanic exploration, as well as the practice of colonial societies established in Africa, Asia and America. The tension between ethnic prejudices and civil rights will be at the core of this module. We will include the debates on freedom of the American Indians, on African slavery, on the abolition of the slave trade and slavery, and on the recognition of citizenship for Native Americans and African freedmen.

  Throughout the enlightenment mainstream social, political and scientific thought in Europe was underpinned by a cosmology that attributed order in nature to divine design, and which accorded man a pre-eminent place in this divine scheme. But from the second half of the eighteenth century this view had come under increasing attack from a number of radical thinkers. The core aim of this course is to provide students with an advanced understanding of these debates about the origin of order in the universe and man&rsquo;s place in nature in their historical and intellectual contexts, with particular emphasis being placed on the social, political and religious dimensions of such controversies. Students will become familiar with a number of key interventions in the debate through a detailed study of the primary texts starting with David Hume&rsquo;s devastating attack on the epistemological basis of natural theology and ending with Charles Darwin&rsquo;s radical revisioning of the relationship between God, man and nature.

  This module offers advanced ways in to the new perspectives that have been developed in the past 10 years or so relating to the origins and consequences of the Atlantic slave trade. Focussing on questions of agency, cultural transformations, and the economic and social consequences of the slave trade, it is an ideal advanced entry point for students interested in the origins and consequences of the institution of slavery in the modern world, in the interrelationship between slavery and empire, and in the cultural and political contexts for interactions of Africans and Europeans in the Atlantic World. The course also provides a theoretical and empirical grounding for further advanced study in the histories of Africa and the Americas in the early modern period, as well as providing an important context for the economic growth of early modern Europe.
Slavery is examined in the totality of relevant contexts: pre-Atlantic European, African and pre-Columbian American forms of slavery are considered together to give a global context to the system of slavery which emerged in the sixteenth century. From this beginning we consider the intersection of these contexts in the 16th century, and move through to the development of the system of slave production by the middle of the 17th century in Brazil and the English Caribbean. This economic and political context is then consolidated in the second half of the course as we consider the cultural consequences of this conjuncture in both the Americas and Europe, and how these developments contributed to the Age of Revolution. By the end of the module, students will have moved towards an understanding not only of the importance of the slave mode of production in both the British and Iberian imperial orbits, but also will see how this process connects to the emergence of global communities and histories and of mixed identities and languages in the Atlantic world.

  This module will examine some of the many different manifestations of religious change and identity in Europe as it was torn apart by the experience of Reformation. It breaks away from the polarized studies of Reformation as a Protestant/Catholic divide to explore the impact of religious developments on a variety of levels, from high politics to parish practice, looking at the experience of the British Isles alongside that of other European states.

  The French Revolution and triumph of the concept of popular sovereignty can be viewed as representing the political equivalent of splitting the atom. Positively, the immense energies released could be harnessed for a variety of purposes, from waging war to providing welfare. Negatively, they could do immense damage unless contained within political structures. Europeans, from French revolutionaries to the nation builders of the 1860s and 1870s, struggled to find constitutions that would achieve these ends.
This module looks at constitutions of the period. Teaching is organised in ten two-hour seminars. Eight of these are grouped into four pairs, arranged chronologically and illustrating developments over time and in different nations. The first seminar in each pair provides an introduction to the political context in which a particular constitution &ndash; whose text is then examined in detail the following week &ndash; came into being. The remaining two seminars include an opening seminar that sets out the main themes, and a concluding seminar that returns to these themes and makes comparisons between national traditions and also assesses developments over time.
The overall aim of this module is to analyse, within a comparative international context, the interplay between political ideas, everyday politics, political structures, and political culture. Chronologically, it spans the period from when no European state possessed a constitution to when the vast majority did. The module is centred on a close-reading of European constitutional texts, which are readily available, both in printed form and electronically, and in English translation as well as in their original languages.

  Historians have for some years been interested in the way that early modern cultural practices, both popular and elite, can be examined through anthropological approaches to ritual behaviour. Most historians interpret the term &lsquo;ritual&rsquo; fairly widely, incorporating secular as well as religious events and concepts. Because much of the most interesting cultural history of the last 25 years has relied on this type of analysis and focused on this type of material, this module will not only be able to introduce students to important concepts in the study of early modern history, but also to many of the chief writings on cultural history in recent years. Discussion will focus on themes of central importance to members of early modern communities, either as individuals or as members both of a face-to-face society and as part of the developing state. 
 The module will begin by examining the theory of ritual. It then will turn to the most easily comprehensible form of ritual life, religious ritual, but will examine not only types and functions of such ritual but also how, in the Reformation, these were reformed (and how this in itself was a ritual process). Further discussions will look at ritual in the life of individuals and communities. These include rites of passage such as marriage and death, rituals marking the passage of time (which contribute to communal and individual consciousness), and rituals which give rise to feelings of solidarity as well as those which express and regulate violence in small communities, both in normal life and on festive occasions. The way that forms of interaction can be ritualized, and how this can contribute to cultures of power, is examined in the final part of the module. Here students will look at the rise of civility and court culture, and the way that forms of ritualized display, including such varied ceremonies as coronations and executions, can function to negotiate power between rulers and ruled.

  This module focuses on the history of selfhood in the &lsquo;long Enlightenment&rsquo; (c.1670-1800), looking at philosophical approaches to the nature of the self, literary and cultural explorations of human emotional responses to the feelings of others (&lsquo;sensibility&rsquo;), and the political ramifications of these cultural and intellectual changes. Core readings will split roughly evenly between primary texts (mostly influential works of philosophy, but including some fiction) and notable recent historiographical studies. Starting with some key late seventeenth-century texts by John Locke and Baruch Spinoza that were hugely influential in the following century, we then look at the emergence of materialist understandings of the self in the early eighteenth century, and at the explosion of interest in &lsquo;sentiment&rsquo; in both fiction and in moral and economic thought in the latter half of the century. We will conclude with a consideration of the significance of changing concepts of the self in the political and cultural upheavals of the American and French Revolutions. Two themes will recur at various points in the course: the development of individualist approaches to ethics and belief as an alternative to traditional religion, and the formation of notions of selfhood in juxtaposition to &lsquo;others&rsquo;, whether across the gender divide or in contrast to non-Europeans or minorities such as Jews.

  The module will offer a comprehensive overview of economic systems of imperial governance since 1500 and economic theories about imperialism. Economic motivation has always been a crucial dimension of imperial projects, but it was expressed or interpreted in different ways throughout the modern era. The module will introduce students to the successive strands of economic thinking that shaped imperial expansion, from the mercantilist reliance on slave-manned plantations and tight commercial regulations to obtain a trade surplus to the liberal economic thought that underpinned &lsquo;free trade imperialism&rsquo; in the nineteenth century and the early formulations of development policies in the twentieth century. The module will also encourage students to engage with the main historical debates about the economics of European imperialism, including the concept of &lsquo;world-system&rsquo;, the links between industrialization and overseas expansion, and the neo-imperialist character of modern international economic institutions. No prior knowledge of economics is required, as the module will focus on general concepts and the connections between the economic and the political, social, and cultural dimensions of imperialism.
