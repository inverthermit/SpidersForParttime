   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Five taught modules comprising lectures, tutorials, and seminars and a significant practical component. There is also a research project which makes up 30 per cent of the MSc. Assessment is through unseen written exams (in January and May), written dissertations, poster presentations, practical write-ups and oral presentations.

  This  module focuses on the function of the human cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The module aims to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ventilation, cardiac output and blood pressure at rest and during exercise, and how these systems interact with the metabolic requirements of working muscles. 
The module aims to provide practical experience in experimentation in human respiratory and cardiovascular physiology with knowledge of appropriate instrumentation, calibration and data acquisition and analysis.
  
    Human   Applied Physiology Library Project - Required

  This course will allow students to develop an in-depth knowledge of the literature concerning an area of topical interest in Human and Applied Physiology. This literature review, which will focus on topic distinct from that of the research project, will enable students to develop analytical, critical, organisational as well as presentational skills.
  
    Human   Applied Physiology research project - Required

   
      
  
    
      
     Module code:

  The research project makes up one third of the MSc programme.  This provides students with an opportunity to undertake a research project either independently or in an active laboratory.  The student will, in conjunction with their chosen research supervisor, plan and carry out experiments to test a hypothesis and to learn and develop laboratory and research skills.  
  
    Human physiology in extreme environments - Required

  In this course students will study human physiological function and performance under extreme conditions. This will include altitude and acceleration physiology and the other major stresses that occur in flight, as well as hyperbaric and marine physiology. Practical components of the course include experiments performed at the RAF Centre for Aviation Medicine, Henlow and the Institute of Naval Medicine, Alverstoke.

      Essay and Oral Presentation
     
  This lecture and seminar based course will focus on the heterogeneity of human physiological function. This will be from the extremes of the elite athlete to the frail elderly person, from the spinal cord injured subject to the obese individual. Among other topics, this course will consider issues concerning doping in sport and examine the importance of physical activity in population health and disease.

  The aim of this course is to provide detailed knowledge of the function of the human muscular system from the molecular to the whole muscle level. To give an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the contractile characteristics of muscle, the means by which it adapts to change in usage and how it fatigues. 
The course will provide practical experience in experimentation in human muscle physiology from mechanical measures  of  whole muscle to practical experience in a molecular biology laboratory for the analyses muscle gene and protein expression.
