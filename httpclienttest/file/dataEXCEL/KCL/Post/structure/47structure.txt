  This module examines the relationship between the family and the state with regard to the welfare and protection of children. We analyse the significance of social and cultural constructions of childhood in defining the concept of maltreatment and consider structural and ecological explanations for the incidence and recognition of child maltreatment as well as individual and familial risk factors for child maltreatment. We discuss the challenges in professional identification and responses to child protection and the appropriate role of the state in supporting parenting and in compulsory intervention in private family life. We study the key features of the English child protection system and consider whether it achieves an appropriate balance between family support, parents&rsquo; rights and the protection of children. We consider alternative care arrangements for children who are unable to be cared for by their birth parents and the outcomes for children who are parented by the state. Throughout the module our focus is on the promotion of the best interests of the child through the prevention and identification of child maltreatment, understanding the effects on the child and consideration of appropriate legal, policy and professional interventions and treatment.

  This module examines the concept of children&rsquo;s rights from a number of theoretical perspectives, the relationship between moral and legal rights, the justifications for and objections to children&rsquo;s rights, and what distinguishes or should distinguish children&rsquo;s rights from the rights of children as humans. We explore the development of children&rsquo;s rights from the historically paternalistic construction of children as vulnerable and dependent to recognition of children as both beings and becomings, entitled to exercise agency and autonomy as well as to protection. We consider the purpose and significance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and its relationship with domestic laws and with the European Convention on Human Rights. We assess the experience of childhood in England in all domains of children&rsquo;s lives from a rights-based perspective and consider the most significant barriers to the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights in this country. Throughout the module, our focus will be on the implications of children&rsquo;s rights for the relationship between the state, the family and the child; the potential conflict between the welfare and agency rights of children and how these conflicts might be resolved.

      A case study of 4,500 words (worth 70% of the mark for the module). This should address a policy or initiative relating to a global issue (that is, an issue that is faced by children in more than one country). The policy or intiative might be concerned with children&rsquo;s welfare, rights ore wellbeing, and may be a regional, national or international initiative.
A review of a book which may, but does not have to be, from the Global Childhoods reading list (worth 30% of the mark for the module). The review will be delivered orally, in a presentation lasting no more than 15 minutes.

     
  This module examines how global social, economic, political and technological processes such globalisation, the spread of capitalism and neo-liberalism variously impact children&rsquo;s lives across the world. Some of the processes and outcomes of these global influences include family change - parental separation, divorce, re-partnering; shifting and fluid generational roles; parental and child migration, poverty and child labour. This module explores how children&rsquo;s experiences of these processes are shaped by children&rsquo;s physical location in the Global North and Global South, in rural or urban areas, and intersect with their identities as children, girls, boys, minority or majority ethnic groups in those locations. It illuminates a number of theoretical approaches (feminist, post-structuralist, post-colonialist) that students can deploy in examining childhood globally. This module invites students to engage in a global and overarching inquiry into childhood(s) rather than examining childhood in one specific country; it encourages students to look across the globe for similarities and differences in childhood experiences.

  This is an optional module that provides an introduction to principles and applications of Psychology to Learning in formal and informal contexts. Over the last three decades, psychological theories and explanation of learning have developed far beyond simple, mechanistic models (such as reinforcement) that are applied in formal settings (especially schools). Within this module, participants will have the opportunity to explore: individual and social circumstances that may promote or hinder learning; characteristics of learning in formal and informal contexts; and individual and social theories of learning. Further, the module will explore how theories of learning have been adapted and ignored in education policies: at pre-school, primary and secondary school levels; with regard to curriculum; and with regard to assessment. In considering explanations of learning, the module will consider issues of development, multiple intelligences, interpersonal support that underlies learning and the effect of culture/activity on learning experience.

They will be provided with a theoretical and critical understanding of the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, and of mixed methods, and equipped with methodological skills and analytic techniques with which to formulate research questions and develop a valid and reliable approach to both quantitative and qualitative research design, data collection, data analysis and data representation. 
This module will also enable students to identify and address methodological and practical issues that may be encountered in conducting qualitative and/or quantitative research; and to reflect on and address the ethical and political implications pertaining to the collection, analysis and dissemination of research data.

  This module is designed to provide a framework through which to examine the conflicting aims, claims, values and beliefs which have underpinned educational provision over time. The module considers several key social science concepts or fields of study with education as the major substantive focus and processes of social change providing the major context of concern. The key concepts include: gender, 'race', class, reproduction theory, globalisation, the market, the politics of knowledge and performativity. The overall aim of the module is to introduce students to a set of concepts, theories and ideas which will enable them to place their own subject interests in relation to wider social, political and economic changes taking place in modern society.

  This module considers what is meant by the concept of social justice and explores some of the difficulties involved in trying to enact socially just practices in education policy. It will consider tensions between distributive, cultural and associational forms of justice by looking at some examples of contexts in which these tensions arise. Each session will focus on a different axis of social differentiation, for example, poverty, disability, sexuality and faith.
