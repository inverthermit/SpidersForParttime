  This module will focus on different aspects of the internationalisation of Chinese enterprises and Chinese outward FDI that have been developed in recent research on the topic. Initially, the students are introduced to the concept of FDI and its measurement, and to common theories of FDI. On the basis of this, they first examine the relevant aspects of the Chinese economy in order to understand the context from which Chinese multinational enterprises have emerged. Chinese global investment patters are considered next, in particular the determinants of Chinese outward FDI and the objectives, motivations and strategies for foreign investors, taking relevant theories into consideration. Some case studies will be examined to enable students to understand the concrete challenges faced by Chinese enterprises when they invest in culturally and institutionally unfamiliar environments. The module will also examine Chinese investments in particular regions and countries, and give special attention to the European Union (EU) as a destination region for Chinese investments. The economic and development impact of Chinese investments is also considered and compared to the impact that other, &ldquo;Western&rdquo; multinationals typically have. Finally, Chinese outward FDI will be examined from the perspective of international relations &ndash; examining the various perspectives of foreign governments and their reactions to Chinese investments. In the context of economic diplomacy, the content of and extent of China&rsquo;s international investment agreements will be considered. The module will conclude by considering future prospects for China and the world.

You will become familiar with different methodological tools to study and analyse social change, and acquire in-depth knowledge of the urban- rural divide in China.

  This course analyses how China successfully managed economic transformation and development since economic reform and opening began in 1979, and evaluates the policies and economic choices in various sectors of the economy that lie behind China&rsquo;s economic success and rapid economic growth. The course will also focus on the current challenges facing the Chinese economy, China&rsquo;s role in a world economy characterised by intensifying economic integration and globalisation, and on future prospects for China&rsquo;s economy.
A discussion of the economic context of China pre-1979, on the basis of which China launched its economic reforms, forms the background of this module. The core part of the course examines transformation in various sectors of the economy under the impact of reform. The rural economy and agriculture, structural change and enterprise reform, macroeconomic challenges, international trade, foreign investment (inward and outward) and the economic impact of China&rsquo;s demographic challenges will be covered in separate sessions. In each of these areas, the current and future challenges to the Chinese economy will be examined and discussed in particular detail.

  How has new historiography challenged our understanding of China's recent past? This module introduces students to the historiography of the "Mao Era" (1949-1976). Based on different weekly themes, the module offers an overview of key issues in the study of PRC history. It encourages students to evaluate how access to new primary sources has changed what we know about mainland China's contemporary history. Over the ten weeks, we will examine the formation of the rural-urban divide, the history of science, technology, and propaganda, the development of a planned economy and industrialisation, the role of law under socialism, the reconfiguration of China's ethnic frontiers, and the international links of PRC state and society. An examination of recent historiography on the PRC will invite students to consider the ways in which historical methodology and analytical frameworks can contribute to understanding China today.
