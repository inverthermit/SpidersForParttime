      A case study of 4,500 words (worth 70% of the mark for the module). This should address a policy or initiative relating to a global issue (that is, an issue that is faced by children in more than one country). The policy or intiative might be concerned with children&rsquo;s welfare, rights ore wellbeing, and may be a regional, national or international initiative.
A review of a book which may, but does not have to be, from the Global Childhoods reading list (worth 30% of the mark for the module). The review will be delivered orally, in a presentation lasting no more than 15 minutes.

     
  This module examines how global social, economic, political and technological processes such globalisation, the spread of capitalism and neo-liberalism variously impact children&rsquo;s lives across the world. Some of the processes and outcomes of these global influences include family change - parental separation, divorce, re-partnering; shifting and fluid generational roles; parental and child migration, poverty and child labour. This module explores how children&rsquo;s experiences of these processes are shaped by children&rsquo;s physical location in the Global North and Global South, in rural or urban areas, and intersect with their identities as children, girls, boys, minority or majority ethnic groups in those locations. It illuminates a number of theoretical approaches (feminist, post-structuralist, post-colonialist) that students can deploy in examining childhood globally. This module invites students to engage in a global and overarching inquiry into childhood(s) rather than examining childhood in one specific country; it encourages students to look across the globe for similarities and differences in childhood experiences.

  This module examines the concept of children&rsquo;s rights from a number of theoretical perspectives, the relationship between moral and legal rights, the justifications for and objections to children&rsquo;s rights, and what distinguishes or should distinguish children&rsquo;s rights from the rights of children as humans. We explore the development of children&rsquo;s rights from the historically paternalistic
construction of children as vulnerable and dependent to recognition of children as both beings and becomings, entitled to exercise agency and autonomy as well as to protection. We consider the purpose and significance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and its relationship with national domestic laws and with the European Convention on Human Rights. We analyse the impact of the UNCRC and consider the challenges of implementing the UNCRC in different areas of children&rsquo;s lives in the varying social and cultural environments in which the world&rsquo;s children grow up. Throughout the module, our focus will be on the implications of children&rsquo;s rights for the relationship between the state, the family and the child; the potential conflict between the welfare and agency rights of children and how these conflicts might be resolved; and the extent to which the
UNCRC may be regarded as founded upon dominant cultural constructions of childhood.

  What can you learn from comparing education systems, schools or teachers? International comparisons have recently risen to prominence in the education policy discourse. At its best, comparative education can inform us about learning in different places or times and can provide us with fresh perspectives on ourselves. When we engage in international comparative education, differences are often stark. A world of alternatives opens up to us - with the capacity to challenge and reassure in equal measure. But caution is advisable. When we observe differences, what are the less visible factors we need to account for? When we find trends across countries, do they reflect national consensus or international pressures? What then is the influence of organisations such as the OECD, UNESCO, the World Bank and the EU? The question arises: are policy makers&rsquo; interpretations justified or do they merely reflect pre-set political imperatives? In this module, we will: familiarise ourselves with the field of comparative education; consider the relationship between education and aspects of national contexts; evaluate the methodology, contribution and limitations of international comparative education; and, identify international trends in curriculum, assessment and pedagogy. During the module, students will be required to identify a topic for their written assignment. One session will be devoted to short presentations on initial exploration of the topic and formative feedback for the full assignment. Students will benefit from the international perspectives of the tutors, outside speakers, and their fellow students.

      1 x 6,000 word assignment: a comparison of an aspect of the systems or arrangements for the protection of children from maltreatment in TWO countries, legal jurisdictions or regions.
     
  This module examines the relationship between the family and the state with regard to the welfare and protection of children. We analyse the significance of social and cultural constructions of childhood for the formation of normative parenting practices around the world and the complexities of establishing consensus as to what constitutes child maltreatment that arise from these constructions. We consider structural and ecological explanations for the incidence and recognition of child maltreatment as well as individual and familial risk factors for child maltreatment. We discuss the appropriate role of the state in supporting parenting and in compulsory intervention in private family life. We compare different models of child welfare and child protection services and of alternative care arrangements for children who are unable to be cared for by their birth parents. We address specific issues of current contention or international concern, such as child labour, child sexual exploitation and forced or early marriage. Throughout the module our focus is on the promotion of the best interests of the child through the prevention and identification of child maltreatment, understanding the effects on the child and consideration of appropriate legal, policy and professional interventions and treatment.

  This is an optional module that provides an introduction to principles and applications of Psychology to Learning in formal and informal contexts. Over the last three decades, psychological theories and explanation of learning have developed far beyond simple, mechanistic models (such as reinforcement) that are applied in formal settings (especially schools). Within this module, participants will have the opportunity to explore: individual and social circumstances that may promote or hinder learning; characteristics of learning in formal and informal contexts; and individual and social theories of learning. Further, the module will explore how theories of learning have been adapted and ignored in education policies: at pre-school, primary and secondary school levels; with regard to curriculum; and with regard to assessment. In considering explanations of learning, the module will consider issues of development, multiple intelligences, interpersonal support that underlies learning and the effect of culture/activity on learning experience.

  In this module, students will be introduced to the range of research methods available to social scientists. They will be provided with a theoretical and critical understanding of the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, and of mixed methods, and equipped with methodological skills and analytic techniques with which to formulate research questions and develop a valid and reliable approach to both quantitative and qualitative research design, data collection, data analysis and data representation. 
This module will also enable students to identify and address methodological and practical issues that may be encountered in conducting qualitative and/or quantitative research; and to reflect on and address the ethical and political implications pertaining to the collection, analysis and dissemination of research data.
