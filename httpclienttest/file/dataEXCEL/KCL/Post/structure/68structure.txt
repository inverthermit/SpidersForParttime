   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Teaching and group supervision takes place on Thursdays (09.15-16.45). The programme begins with three introductory intensive one-day workshops, which aim to provide students with an overview of the model, therapeutic style and content of initial sessions. This is usually a refresher for more experienced students and sets the scene for identifying students' individual learning targets and goals. Teaching modules are examined by assignments &ndash; audiorecordings, case reports and practice portfolios for the clinical modules; essays and research presentations for the academic modules. Clinical students will be required to work with at least four clients for at least 16 sessions from assessment to completion or termination of therapy over the duration of the programme.

      This module is required for the PG Cert and optional for the PG Dip.
     
  The modules are designed to assess experience and practice in CBT and/or FI in psychosis to ensure that students have sufficient expertise to become trainers and supervisors in the approaches. Both theoretical knowledge and clinical skills are assessed. Small group or individual tutoring and supervision is delivered to support students in their development and to compile the portfolio.
  
The modules aims to provide students with the skills to critically evaluate the evidence base for the interventions. Research from biological, social, cognitive, behavioural and emotional perspectives will be integrated, to enable understanding of the rationale for particular interventions and the justification for the strategies used. Gaps and inconsistencies in the existing knowledge base will be identified, and the research required to advance the field discussed. Knowledge will be applied to clinical cases through workshop teaching.
  
Teaching will take the form of workshops, supervision, seminars case presentations and research presentations and will cover theory and evidence at the forefront of the field. Students will undertake critical evaluation of the literature, synthesising existing information to generate novel ideas for research relevant to each clinical area. In workshops, clinical applications of theory and elements of practice will be covered, including role play and small group exercises. In seminars, selected research papers representing the latest developments in a particular field will be discussed and evaluated. Research presentations comprise a brief presentation to the seminar group on a particular topic, and are assessed for accuracy of understanding, quality of critique and quality of research ideas, as well as communication and presentation skills. Specialist applications for particular clinical groups are also covered, with each session taught by an expert in the field. Models of learning and supervision, critical reflection on and evaluation of the effectiveness of supervision will also be taught, together with adapting clinical skills - such as flexible and creative problem solving, to supervisory work, and the use of recently developed training manuals and standardised ratings of clinical work as training tools. Effective communication skills for the purposes of supervision and educating clinical teams will be taught. Later sessions will focus on managing a role as a CBT for psychosis therapist within a clinical team or other service, addressing workload, continuing supervision and professional development, creative adaptation of skills to maximise benefits to a particular service, and educating referrers to maximise the use of the service.
  
At the end of the module, students will be able to use an individualised clinical formulation to identify appropriate targets for intervention; use both research and clinical literature and clinical expertise to devise and flexibly deliver innovative cognitive behavioural interventions, adopting a scientist-practitioner model, and in line with best practice guidelines; evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and adapt them accordingly; and communicate both interventions and their efficacy in a clear and informative style to both clients and colleagues, in written and verbal form.
They will have a critical understanding of models of supervision and learning, and will be able to draw on these eclectically to develop, deliver and evaluate individualised supervision. They will be aware of issues relating to delivering CBT for psychosis within a service, and able to adopt a problem solving approach to these. They will be able to adapt their skills in communicating about CBT for psychosis to different situations presenting within supervision and within clinical services. Students will be able to reflect on and evaluate their own and others' clinical work, including using standardised ratings to objectively evaluate therapy, and will be aware of professional and ethical considerations in undertaking therapeutic work of this type and the supervision of others in undertaking this work. Academically they will be able to identify opportunities for further research in and development of these specialist fields. They will be able to critically analyse and evaluate scientific papers pertaining to the development and evaluation of CBT for psychosis.
  
Assessment is by case presentation, research presentation, logbook and supervisor report and audiorecording of clinical practice, each accounting for 25% of the module mark.

      This module is required   for the PG Cert and optional for the PG Dip.
Assessment is by two 5000-word case studies (each 25 per cent  of the total grade) and two 45-minute audiorecordings (25 per cent  each). Students are required to keep a log book.
     
  The module provides specialist post-qualification training in the skills to competently engage clients with psychosis, make effective use of assessment tools, develop an individualised formulation, and communicate this information in a clear and informative style to both clients and colleagues, in written and verbal form.
Engagement: High levels of interpersonal sensitivity, flexibility and clinical skill are required to effectively engage people with psychosis in productive clinical work. Teaching addresses forming and maintaining therapeutic relationships, overcoming challenges to engagement, identifying personal goals for therapy, and socialising clients to a CBT model. Illustrative clinical literature is used, with a critical stance to content. Students progress from beginner level through competent practice to mastery.
Assessment: The skills required to complete a detailed assessment for CBT are covered. Broad initial assessment of problems, difficulties and areas for change progresses to detailed examination of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural maintaining factors, which lead on to an individualised formulation (see next section). The use of standardised rating scales, interview schedules, and the development of personal rating scales is also covered. The practice of evaluating therapy outcome by establishing a baseline then measuring change, and effective methods for achieving this, will be inculcated.
Formulation: Assessment information is used to inform a model of how the person's difficulties are being maintained, and how they developed. Formulations in CBTp are developed with the client, and careful attention will be paid to engaging clients in this process and matching therapeutic style to the pace and perspective of the client. The literature on cognitive models of psychosis and other disorders is used to promote high level skills in both integrating a wide ranging literature, then tailoring that knowledge to develop a formulation suited to particular individual. Formulations emphasise the routes to solve problems and meet the person's goals, and thus inform intervention.
Teaching will take the form of workshops, together with intensive and detailed supervision. Students will critically review and practice techniques used in engagement, and acquire skills in the flexible and creative use of these with clients. Teaching will also cover the critical evaluation of assessment tools and the development of novel and individualised assessments for complex presenting problems. Analysis and synthesis of clinical assessment information and theoretical knowledge to generate individualised formulations for clients and the development of skills in sharing formulations with clients will be taught through supervision and workshops. Reflection on and evaluation of own and others' clinical work, including the use of standardised ratings, and the adoption of a scientist-practitioner model, will be promoted, with reference to guidelines for best practice in evidence-based intervention in CBT for psychosis, moving students towards responsibility for their own professional practice and development. Effectively communicating work to colleagues in written and verbal form will be covered.
At the end of the module, students will be able to competently adopt flexible and creative techniques for engaging clients, and conducting effective assessments, meeting guidelines for best practice in engagement, assessment, and formulation in CBT for psychosis. They will be able to analyse and synthesise clinical assessment information and theoretical knowledge to generate novel and individualised formulations of complex problems, which will inform intervention; establish a baseline from which to assess the effectiveness of interventions; and effectively communicate this information in verbal and written form to both clients and colleagues. Students will be able to adopt a scientist-practitioner approach to engagement, assessment and formulation, and make use of supervision to reflect upon, evaluate and develop both their own work and that of other students. They will be aware of professional and ethical considerations in undertaking this type of therapeutic work and the supervision of others in undertaking this work.
