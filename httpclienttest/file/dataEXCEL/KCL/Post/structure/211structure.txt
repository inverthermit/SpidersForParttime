  An important module if you are interested in the moral issues which arise in the context of medical practice and medical law. An introduction to the major theories provides you with a theoretical framework for the analysis of a range of complex problems in medical ethics. You develop a critical awareness of the principles and doctrines operating and learn to apply them in a systematic and creative way to some of the most difficult issues facing the medical profession today.
This module is a pre-requisite for all other modules on the programme.

  This module is for students who wish to increase their knowledge of, as well as develop a critical understanding of, the complex moral issues arising in the context of disability. The notion of disability is one of the most contested in medical ethics. This module explores different conceptions of disability and how these differences affect both how we think about individuals with disability and public policy. Using the examples of autism and bi-polarity it will explore the idea of neurodiversity and cultural identity. It will also consider the moral problems raised by potential developments in enhancement technologies, particularly in the areas of cognitive improvements, sport and even morality.

  Covers a broad range of the diverse and difficult ethical issues that arise when a life is coming to an end for whatever reason. Topics include euthanasia and assisted suicide, the persistent vegetative state, the sale of organs for transplantation, dying with dignity, the care of the demented, clinical research on terminally ill patients and ageism in resource allocation. 
The module draws on and reinforces the theoretical background provided by the module Moral Theory    Medical Ethics by applying the different moral viewpoints analysed there to these critical issues of life and death.

  Half-module

Taught by: Professor Penney Lewis

The patient's right to consent to or refuse medical treatment is protected by human rights law and common law principles. This right protects the patient's self-determination, bodily integrity and dignity. You study the law governing consent to treatment for competent and incompetent patients of all ages; the constituent elements of the tort of battery; refusal of treatment; and requests for treatment including the allocation of scarce medical resources and the role of the public law (judicial review).
This module is compulsory for all MA MEL students who have not already studied Medical Law in the UK; if taken it must be passed.

  Half-module

Taught by: TBC

You study the nature of liability in tort; the constituent elements of the tort of negligence; the general principles of tort law, such as vicarious liability and damages; the social context in which tort law operates; and possible directions of reform for compensation for medical misadventure including no-fault compensation schemes. The increasing role of the criminal law in cases of medical error is also examined, for example prosecutions for gross negligence manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and health and safety offences.

  
    Mental Health Law   Criminal Justice (half-module) - Optional

  Half-module 

Taught by: Professor Genevra Richardson

You examine the legal structure within which care and treatment are provided and at the implications of the European Convention of Human Rights and the background to recent law reform. The principles underpinning the law relating to people with mental disorder who have just come into contact with the criminal justice system are covered. You concentrate on the position of offender patients and examine the relationship between mental health law, the substantive criminal law and the principles of sentencing.

  
    Mental Health Law: The Civil Context (half-module) - Optional

  Half-module

Taught by: Professor Genevra Richardson

In the UK, as in many other jurisdictions, the law makes special provision for people with mental disorder. The principles underpinning the law relating to people with mental disorder are introduced and you consider the rationale and possible justification for this special legal provision. Concentration is on the law relating to non-offender patients and examines the relationship between mental health law and the law relating to those who lack capacity.

  Below are the indicative topics that can be taken. Any two of the topics listed below can be selected for Topics in Medical Ethics I (20 credits); any two topics not already selected can be taken for Topics in Medical Ethics II (20 credits). These modules provide you with a knowledge and critical understanding of key topics in medical ethics.
Psychriatic Ethics
Psychiatric practitioners and other mental health professionals face a set of distinctive ethical questions that link into deep philosophical issues to do with the mind. This topic addresses a range of central issues in this area: how to define mental disorder, and corresponding issues concerning diagnosis and the relevance of neuroscience; ethical dilemmas concerning autonomy and mental disorder, particularly in relation to substituted decisions and advance directives; and the question of why mental disorder is taken to be relevant to moral and criminal responsibility.
Justice    the Allocation of Health Care Resources
In a situation of permanent scarcity of health care resources but with a National Health Service, many difficult moral problems arise about how the resources we have should be used. This module addresses these issues by examining what social justice requires and whether considerations of justice can give us a practical resolution of the problem of scarce resources. It looks at some of the decisions made by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and at the cost-benefit analysis behind its decision-making.  You will also consider some of the problems associated with other countries' approach to these issues.
Reproductive Ethics
This module covers the central issues in reproductive ethics by addressing a number of key topics such as abortion, and disability and in so doing it familiarises  you with the key ethical arguments in this context. The main theme concerns the scope of the moral interest in having or not having a child or children.
Reproduction    Genetics
This module covers the central ethical issues in genetic selection practices by addressing key topics in relation to selection by means of pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD), prenatal diagnosis (PND) and selective abortion and by identifying and clarifying the key ethical arguments in this context.
Autism
Autism, once thought to be a rare condition, is now estimated to affect 1 in every 100 people (some estimates are 1 in 68). As a complex neurodevelopmental condition autism manifests itself very differently from one person to another, ranging from very high functioning to very low functioning abilities and all the points in between. This course will consider what we actually know about autism spectrum conditions and how best we should understand them. The ethical questions are correspondingly complex. The topic will address some of these, including the crucial question of whether autism is best understood as a disability in all cases or should be understood as an acceptable cognitive difference. Other key issues include the surprising association between autism and talent and how this might affect our thinking about disability, reproductive decision-making and the search for a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for autism.
Neuroethics
Recent advances in the brain sciences offer new ways of learning about ourselves and others, using powerful technologies. These developments raise a range of ethical questions, some that are versions of familiar questions in bioethics, and others that are completely new. This topic addresses both kinds of question, providing a survey of this emerging field. The issues covered include the ethics of incidental findings in the context of neuroscience research; issues arising in the context of new technologies for detecting minimally conscious states; the use of neuroimaging in the courtroom; and the implications of cognitive science for our understanding of morality and freedom.
Autonomy and Public Health
Public health ethics is concerned with justifications for public health programmes, policies and law. Work in this area addresses population-level questions about the promotion and protection of health. This topic focuses on the core tension between individual autonomy and health. The appropriate limits of state action in promoting or preserving health are considered through the examination of: interventions that &ldquo;nudge&rdquo;; the use of health incentives; supported decision-making and a relational understanding of autonomy; and what should be done in the context of contagious disease.
