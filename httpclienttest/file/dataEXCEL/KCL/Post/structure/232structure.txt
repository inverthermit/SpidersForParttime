  Aims and objectives:
Real Analysis is one of the core subjects in every reputable Mathematics degree programme. It enables us to explain why results require proof and that statements are only true in a context of some precise technical conditions. It also provides the knowledge needed to make sense of a variety of other topics in the syllabus, such as complex analysis, dynamical systems and differential equations, all of which have immense importance within the subject. It is expected that you will understand and be able to reproduce the proofs of the major theorems of the subject. You should also appreciate the logical relationships between the different parts of the subject and be able to use the ideas of the module in a variety of situations.
Syllabus:
The module builds upon the material in 4CCM115a Numbers and Functions, which you are expected to know. It emphasises the difference between school level calculus and a rigorous treatment of the same topics. The material starts with definitions of limits of sequences and series, and simple criteria for convergence, with many examples of the kind you should learn how to handle. This part of the module includes the Cauchy criterion, absolute convergence of series and a study of power series.
Real variable theorems include definitions of continuity and differentiation with proofs of well established theorems for functions of a single real variable up to Taylor's theorem.
Properties of an elementary integral in one space dimension will be studied briefly, starting from a list of axioms for the integral. Proofs will be given of the fundamental theorem of
calculus and of the rules for evaluating integrals.

    Semester 2 (spring)     
   
    
  
       
    
     
  Aims and objectives:
The purpose of the module is to introduce the notions of Fourier series and Fourier transform and to study their basic properties. The main part of the module will be devoted to the one dimensional case in order to simplify the definitions and proofs. Many multidimensional results are obtained in the same manner, and those results may also be stated. The Fourier technique is important in various fields, in particular, in the theory of (partial) differential equations. It will be explained how one can solve some integral and differential equations and study the properties of their solutions using this technique.
Syllabus:
Series expansions. Definition of Fourier series. Related expansions. Bessel's inequality. Pointwise and uniform convergence of Fourier series. Periodic solutions of differential equations. The vibrating string. Convolution equations. Mean square convergence. Schwartz space S. Fourier transform in S. Inverse Fourier transform. Parseval's formula. Solutions of differential equations with constant coefficients.

      Semester:  
    Semester 2 (spring)     
   
    
  
       
    
     
  Aims and objectives:
To develop the theory of finite extensions of fields, culminating in an understanding of the Galois Correspondence. To demonstrate the power of this theory by applying it to the solution of historically significant questions. For instance: for which polynomials can all the roots be written as 'radical expressions' (i.e. expressions involving the usual operations of arithmetic together with roots of any degree)? To provide an important tool for further studies in Algebra e.g. Number Theory.
Syllabus:
Review of the basic theory of rings, polynomials and fields; Eisenstein's Criterion; first properties of finite extensions of fields and their degrees; algebraicity and transcendence; field embeddings and automorphisms; normal extensions; separable extensions; the Galois Correspondence; examples of practical calculation; soluble groups and extensions; (in)solubility of polynomial equations by radical expressions.
Further topics may include finite fields, constructability by straightedge and compass, etc. as time allows.
Books:
The following are highly recommended:
&bull; I. Stewart, 'Galois Theory ', Chapman and Hall: 2nd ed. 1989, 3rd ed. 2004.
&bull; J. Rotman, 'Galois Theory ', Universitext, Springer, 2nd ed. 1998.
The course most closely follows the level and order of exposition of the 2nd edition of (1). (The 3rd, expanded, edition starts at too elementary a level but contains interesting extra detail). Rotman's book (2) lacks some of the colour and historical detail of (1). On the other hand, it has useful sections on groups and rings. Further background material on groups may be found in:

      written examination/s     
    
     
  Aims and objectives:
This module provides a first introduction to quantum mechanics, the theory used to describe processes at and below atomic length scales. Its basic formalism differs drastically from what occurs in classical mechanics, and the probabilistic aspects raise unexpected interpretational questions. The lectures will not attempt to solve those, but aim at discussing the formalism itself and at showing how it leads to key features of quantum mechanics such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the surprising discreteness of certain quantities.
Syllabus:
Historical account of the problems with classical physics which made the development of quantum physics necessary; wave-particle dualism. Schr&ouml;dinger's equation and probabilistic interpretation. Some simple one-dimensional examples. A more abstract formulation, including some remarks on general Hilbert spaces and operators. Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. Heisenberg picture of time evolution. If time permits, an outlook on symmetries, the Hydrogen atom, and other topics.
Books:
&bull; Bransden, Joachain "Quantum Mechanics" gives a fairly complete account, including a lot of physics background information.
&bull; Isham "Lectures on Quantum Theory" provides a good and detailed summary of the mathematical tools and discusses interpretational issues.

  Aims and objectives:
This course sets concepts from the 'methods' course 4CCM113a (CM113A) (e.g. determinant and dimension) in the more general framework of abstract vector spaces. It also gives the precise definitions and proofs that are essential for much of higher mathematics, both pure and applied. Further concepts and methods are also introduced in the same manner. Examples from Rn and Cn will be given where possible to illustrate the geometrical meaning behind the algebraic ideas. The course will emphasise the interplay between abstract and more concrete ideas.
Syllabus:
General definition and properties of vector spaces, subspaces and linear maps. Linear independence, basis and dimension. Rank and nullity for linear maps. The relation between linear maps and matrices. Change of basis and similarity of matrices. Inverse matrices. Eigenvectors, eigenvalues and diagonalisation of matrices. Inner product spaces and orthogonal diagonalisation.
Books:
The course will not follow one particular textbook. There is a vast array of books on linear algebra that contain the material of the course (often also covering the preliminary material from linear methods). Here is a small sample, listed in roughly increasing order of sophistication:
&bull; Elementary Linear Algebra', Howard Anton, 8th ed., Wiley, 2000.

  Aims and objectives:
Mathematical biology is a very active and fast growing interdisciplinary area in which mathematical concepts, techniques, and models are applied to a variety of problems in developmental biology and biomedical sciences. Many biological processes can be quantitatively characterized by differential equations. This course introduces you to a variety of models mainly based on ordinary differential equations and techniques for analysing these models. Mathematical concepts on nonlinear dynamics and chaos will be introduced. Population models (predator-prey, competition), epidemic models and reaction enzyme kinetics will be discussed. Some probabilistic modelling of molecular evolution will also be introduced.
No previous knowledge of biology is necessary.
Syllabus:
Continuous population models for single species; Discrete population models for single species; Continuous population models for interacting species; Modelling infectious disease transmission/spread using ODEs; Reaction kinetics; Introduction to DNA and modelling of molecular evolution

  Aims and Objectives:
The theory of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) forms the basis for many fundamental areas of mathematics. Apart from their fundamental role in physics and mechanics, such as in describing how electromagnetic-waves propagate through space, PDEs also provide the tools for many areas of pure mathematics. In 'geometric analysis', for instance, the way in which a given space is curved (e.g a surface such as a sphere) is studied by associating to it a geometric evolution equation ---- the idea is this, different spaces sound differently when you tap them, as for example we know from tapping drums of different shapes and sizes; the question, then, is "can you hear the shape of a drum"?
An important technique in solving PDEs is provided by functions of a complex variable, which constitutes one of the most elegant branches of pure mathematics. The second part of the module will be devoted to the implementation of those techniques.
The module will be taught in a manner akin to Calculus II, That is, this is a 'methods course' and so will not deal with the many abstractions that a more rigorous exposition would entail. Nevertheless, a student who has mastered this module will be in a strong position to appreciate the subtleties of a rigorous module on Complex Analysis such as 6CCM322A, or one of the many third and fourth year modules dealing with various aspects of PDEs.
Syllabus:
Partial Differential Equations
Basic ideas: linear equations, homogeneous equations, superposition principle. Laplace's equation in two variables, simple boundary value problems. Separation of variables. Fourier series. Introduction to Fourier transforms with applications.
Complex Variable
Revision of complex numbers. Basic definitions: open sets, domain, curves, trace of a curve. Definitions of continuity, differentiability, analyticity. Cauchy-Riemann equations. Integration along a smooth curve; integration along a contour; Cauchy's theorem. Cauchy's integral formula, Laurent's theorem, Taylor's theorem. Calculus of residues. Contour integration.

  Aims and objectives:
This is a second module in abstract algebra. It aims to develop the general theory of rings (especially commutative ones) and then study in some detail a new concept, that of a module over a ring. Both abelian groups and vector spaces may be viewed as modules and important structure theorems for both follow from the general theory. The theory of rings and modules is key to many more advanced algebra courses e.g. Algebraic Number Theory. It can also help with others, e.g. Galois Theory, Representation Theory and Algebraic Geometry.
Syllabus:
Basic concepts of ring theory: subrings, ideals, quotient, product, matrix and polynomial rings; factorisation in integral (euclidean, principal ideal) domains. Basic concepts of module theory: submodules, quotient modules, direct sums, homomorphisms, finitely generated, cyclic, free and torsion modules, annihilator ideals. Matrices and finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain: Equivalence of matrices, structure theory of modules, applications to abelian groups and to vector spaces with a linear transformation.
