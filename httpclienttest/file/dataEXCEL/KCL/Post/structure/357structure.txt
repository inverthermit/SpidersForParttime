   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Full-time study: Approximately 20 hours of taught classes per week with some entire weeks spent at research establishments in the UK and abroad. Part-time study: Not offered. The programme will comprise lectures, tutorials and seminars with a large practical component. The latter will provide personal experience and experimental studies of a wide variety of Space relevant environments including flight, acceleration, heat and cold, noise, and spatial disorientation.   Modules are assessed by coursework and/or examinations. The 10,000 word dissertation (with 10+5 min oral presentation) aims to facilitate student research in the labs of world renowned supervisors in space agencies, academia and industry across the globe.

  This module seeks to investigate the physiological, medical and operational issues relating to placing humans in space for prolonged periods - be those on the International Space Station or for exploration of the Solar System. As a result we receive expert lectures  from Space Agencies, academia and industry from across the globe.  
In addition a research project in conducted at the Centre of Aviation Medicine (RAF Henlow) using the hypobaric chambers and we spend a week at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne (incorporating Astronaut lessions and  visiting training and operations facilities plus the German Space Agency research facilities  eg.  ESA short arm centrifuge.  
This module aims to: 
Provide detailed and in depth knowledge of the physiological effects of the space environment upon humans and of the methods employed to mitigate such effects.
Provide practical experience in experimentation methods appropriate to investigate the physiological effects of the space environment and those employed to mitigate such effects. A knowledge of instrumentation, calibration, data acquisition and the analysis of results whilst applying the appropriate statistical methods.
Provide an understanding of the effect of the space environment upon human behaviour and performance.
Provide a detailed knowledge of the practical implications of disease and physical deconditioning in space-faring humans and the practices required to counter and manage such events.
