  By way of an interdisciplinary approach, and in support of more detailed case study analysis on optional courses available on this MA, this core module introduces the history and politics of the Middle East   Mediterranean. Special emphasis is placed on the dialectics of unity and fragmentation, created by a millenarian legacy of universal empires, and their impact on the modern Middle East and Mediterranean, introducing you to the main religious, intellectual, political and cultural trends that have flourished in the region since antiquity.

  The aim of this module is to provide an in-depth historical analysis of the origin and development of the Arab-Israeli conflict from its onset in the early 20th century to the present day.
More specifically, it provides an introduction to the primary literature and the historiographical debate surrounding the creation of the State of Israel, the collapse and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society, and the ongoing conflict between Arabs and Jews over the Holy Land.
The course begins with a broad survey of Jewish and Arab/Muslim history in Palestine in general, and since the late 19th century in particular. It then looks at the impact of the British mandate on Arab-Jewish relations and its culmination in the establishment of the State of Israel and the collapse and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society, before proceeding to explore the successive Arab attempts to reverse the consequences of the 1948 war, or the Naqba (the catastrophe) as it is known in Arab parlance, against the backdrop of regional and global developments. Finally the course discusses the various peace initiatives over the past six decades and assesses the chances of attaining this cherished goal.

  The module commences with a review of the theories of international trade and key policy issues affecting the world trading system since the creation of the GATT in 1947 and subsequently the WTO in 1995. The overarching focus is on trade protection and trade liberalization through an examination to a number of bilateral and regional trade arrangements across the Middle East and how these arrangements affected the economic development of the region. The module gives students the opportunity to debate the challenges facing inter-Arab trade relations, including regional and sub-regional groupings such as the Greater inter-Arab Free Trade Area, the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Agadir Agreement. Key policy issues such as dumping and antidumping, intra-industry trade, trade creation and trade diversion are examined. Trade relations between the Middle East and major trading partners, including the European Union, and the United States, are analysed in the context of broad policy frameworks such as the Barcelona Process. Turkey&rsquo;s customs union with the EU and the GCC trade relations with China, India and Japan are also explored.
The module is expected to provide students with an understanding of current international trade flows and trade policies, and allow them to appreciate and participate in the debates and discussions that constantly rage in this area in the Middle Eastern contextthrough detailed case studies. It will also provide students with the tools to address the theoretical approaches underpinning the development of foreign trade policies and institutions, as well as the analytical, research, presentation and writing skills that are essential for employability and marketplace.

  Iran's traumatic encounter with Russian and British imperialism in the modern age did not only bring the country into direct contact with two powerful and aggressive European nations. It also brought about a deep sense of insecurity towards a foreign form of military, economic, political and social modernity that the Iranian intellectual elites will attempt to comprehend, emulate, reject, or hybridise. From the early modernists and constitutionalists who aimed to reform the Iranian state to catch up with Europe, to nativisits and Islamists who emphatically rejected the Pahlavi state's westernisation programme, Iranian intellectuals of the modern period have all, in one way or the other, been 'obsessing with the West'. This module will cover modern Iran's intellectual history in order to shed light on this momentous, and often painful, process of transformation. In other terms, this is a history of Iran's entry into modernity, seen through the eyes of intellectuals.

  This module analyses contemporary Islamist revolutionary movements in the Middle East, charting the rise of leading figures in the Egyptian, Saudi and Iraqi Islamist movements. Examining the influence their ideas had on Islamist groups in Algeria, Lebanon and the Palestinian Territories, this course evaluates the challenge militant Islam poses to the Middle East state system and how this challenge has been met.
Using comparative analysis, this course enables you to evaluate the origins of political Islam and its impact on the contemporary Middle East. It will familiarise you with the scholarly theoretical debates over the rise of militant Islam and Western responses to the phenomena of international jihadism.

  The contemporary state system in the Middle East is a relic of World War I, in the aftermath of which the European powers and their regional allies dismembered the defeated Ottoman Empire and distributed the parts in accordance with their interests. But the artificiality and instability of the resultant entities created a political legacy whence the role of the absolute leader supersedes the role of political institutions, and where citizenship is largely synonymous with submission. This course offers an in-depth analysis of the origin, scope, and implications of this phenomenon through an examination of the main leaders who shaped Middle Eastern history during this period.

  The module will commence with a 1-hour lecture introducing key issues in EU-Middle East relations from the birth of the EEC in the late 1950s up until the end of the cold war and beyond. This will be followed by weekly lectures and seminars which will provide the opportunity to delve into four key topics: EU diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Union&rsquo;s policy towards Iran, its relationship with Turkey and finally the EU&rsquo;s growing ties with the GCC states. In particular, we will examine evolving bilateral political and economic relations between the Union and these states and the Union&rsquo;s role in contributing to conflict resolution in the region and also consider the EU&rsquo;s reaction towards the Arab Spring as one of the most recent developments in the region.

  The United States has become the pre-eminent power in an area that stretches from the western Mediterranean to central Asia. Americans have had an enduring fascination with the region beginning with the arrival of missionaries on Middle Eastern shores in the 19th century, but it is only relatively recently&mdash;slightly more than 50 years&mdash;in which Washington has become an important political actor in the region. The goal of this course is to examine and explain the determinants of U.S. involvement in the Middle East. In order to ground the subject matter in firm analytical foundations, the course applies general concepts and theories of international politics to illuminate Washington&rsquo;s role in the region.
The module begins with an introduction to historic US intervention   mediation in the Middle East region. It then proceeds to look at the involvement of the United States in the Middle East in the Cold war and the post-Cold War eras. It will look at America&rsquo;s bilateral relations with key regional players including Israel/Palestine, Iraq and Iran. It will also examine Washington as an intervening power throughout the region, its role in facilitating Arab-Israeli peacemaking since the 1970s, and its reaction to the Arab Spring.
