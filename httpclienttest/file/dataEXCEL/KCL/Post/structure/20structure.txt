   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  This masters programme is assessed through a combination of assignments, written examinations, clinical case presentations and a dissertation. In the first two years, most modules within the programme are assessed by a combination of 60 per cent written examination and 40 per cent written assignments. 
For each module, you must complete a self-assessment exercise, a formative assignment and a final summative essay/assignment, to be entered into the end of year written examination. Exams can be taken in London or, for overseas students, at centres in the student's country of residence. If you fail an examination at the first sitting, you will be permitted one further attempt. 
During years one and two, years clinical work is also undertaken which is assessed by submission of clinical case presentations. In the final year, you will be allocated a supervisor and undertake a dissertation or project between January and September. The dissertation provides the mark for Year 3.
