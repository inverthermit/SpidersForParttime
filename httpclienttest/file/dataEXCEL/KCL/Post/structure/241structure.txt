  This module explains how current immunological knowledge is applied to diagnosis, disease assessment and therapeutic management of the cancer patient. We discuss how knowledge of the impact of cancers on the immune system is dependent upon an understanding of the neoplastic process as well as of the immune system itself, and we illustrate the field with reference to tumours of the immune system as well as other body tissues.
Cancer cell biology
Immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis and staging of tumours
Immune response to tumour: cancer surveillance and immunodepression
Cytokines: their role in the host-tumour relationship
Monoclonal antibodies in diagnosis and treatment of cancer
Cellular therapy for cancer: from peptides to dendritic cells
Cancer vaccines  
Cancer gene therapy
Immunological readouts to measure effects of cancer immunotherapy

Students are thereby expected to appreciate that the immunological response to tumour may be sensitisation or secondary immunodepression and to understand the rationale for research into cancer vaccines and gene therapy. This module deals with application of some of the leading-edge developments of molecular medicine to the problems of diagnosis and treatment of the tumour-bearing host.

  This module concerns the spectrum of extrinsic allergic diseases attributable to local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions of the sensitised host to non-replicating antigens of plants, animals, insects, fungal spores, occupational chemicals, anaesthetic and diagnostic chemical agents. The immunopharmacology, immunopathogenesis and clinical features of allergic diseases of the respiratory tract, skin, eye and gastrointestinal tract are described and the systemic reactions of acute anaphylaxis are explained. Particular attention is directed towards understanding the cellular mechanisms and immunopharmacology involved, and how this knowledge contributes to the understanding and development of anti-allergic drug treatment as well as to patient management. The importance of this module lies in the increasing prevalence of allergic diseases in both children and adults; and evidence of genetic predisposition is brought up-to-date.

IgE structure, function and measurement
Mediators of IgE dependent reactions
Immune and inflammatory mechanisms and the T-cell allergic response
Asthma/rhino-conjunctivitis
Atopic dermatitis; genetic predisposition

Treatment of allergic disease: allergen avoidance, hyposensitisation
Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions

  This module reviews current knowledge and growing points in the understanding of genetic (primary) and acquired (secondary) forms of immunodeficiency and the clinical disorders that can develop in association with them in infancy, childhood and adult life. Knowledge of pathways of haemopoiesis and immune/accessory-cell maturation reveal sites affected by genetic immunodeficiencies which might also be &lsquo;risk sites&rsquo; for forms of secondary immunodeficiency. The clinical features of immunodeficiency disorders are illustrated by case presentations and there are laboratory practical demonstrations which concern how the individual with a suspected immunodeficiency disorder is investigated.
Haemopoietic cell and immune-cell maturation pathways
Ontogenesis of the human immune system
Genetics, molecular basis and clinical features of B-cell, T-cell, opsonin, complement, and the phagocyte deficiency syndromes

Hypergammaglobulinaemia: diagnosis and treatment of antibody deficiencies
Secondary immunodeficiency: arguably, the most important immunological disorder
Laboratory tests for the investigation of suspected immunodeficiency
Case scenarios and quiz

Having attended this module students are expected to understand how knowledge of the genetics and cell maturation pathways now identified in forms of primary immunodeficiency leads to immunodiagnostic tests and therapeutic management. Students are also expected to understand how the many factors that cause secondary immunodeficiency, including virus infections such as HIV, disturb specific molecular and cellular pathways of the immune response; and to appreciate the implications for diagnosis and management of the associated disorders.

  The purpose of this module, which may be taught in two blocks, is to put into perspective the practical aspects of NHS clinical immunology laboratory services in the United Kingdom. In practical immunodiagnosis we review the scientific basis and clinical interpretation of the common categories of immunological laboratory tests and discuss the major criteria of diagnostic performance whereby the utility of these procedures is judged in clinical practice. Quality Control and Quality Assurance are the subject of lectures and class exercises aimed to clarify the definitions and usage of terms used to express variations in results; whilst laboratory and clinical audit, and accreditation procedures, are presented in the context of clinical governance of the NHS and the clinical and scientific need to continually improve the quality of laboratory and clinical services in Immunology.
Concepts of normality and abnormality as applied to immunological status
Laboratory performance criteria of within-test, and between-test variation of results
Clinical performance criteria of immunochemical, autoimmune and cellular-based laboratory tests for diagnosis, monitoring and exclusion of immunological disease
Internal quality control, external quality assurance and the use of biological standards of immunological reactants
Laboratory and clinical audit
Accreditation procedures and their relationships to continued audit in the maintenance of quality
Clinical governance: principles and practice of the management of immunological services

By means of this module the student will appreciate how abnormal immune status in disease is quantified within individual patients and how the diagnostic and prognostic utility of the various test procedures make up the field of medical Immunology. The student will thereby understand the conceptual and operational basis for maintaining the quality of service work in applying immunological science to the practice of clinical immunology in the NHS.
