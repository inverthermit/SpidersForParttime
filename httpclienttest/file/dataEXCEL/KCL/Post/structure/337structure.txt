  This module aims to provide students with a critical understanding of the ethical approaches and governance of health and social science research, as applied to sensitive issues and vulnerable populations.  The module will explore contrasting responses from different interest groups and theoretical standpoints, including the social and behavioural sciences, and public and social policy where appropriate.  NB: The module will not cover issues relating to basic clinical research.
On successful completion of this module, students will be able to demonstrate a critical understanding of:
1. The fundamental ethical considerations and legal frameworks underpinning health and social science research.
2. The ethical considerations arising throughout the research process: from initial project concept to research governance and dissemination.
3. Consent, capability and autonomy in research participation.
4. The general principles and practices underpinning the interests and protection of vulnerable research participants, including confidentiality and anonymity.
5. The dilemmas and required responses to &lsquo;wearing two hats&rsquo; of clinician and researcher.
6. Ethical and practical issues relating to the safety of researchers
