  This module enables students to derive a greater understanding of the relationship between methodology and method and the related notions of epistemology and ontology. The module is a mix of lectures and tutorials and enables students to develop skills in the appropriate use and application of quantitative and qualitative methods, which will have been worked through in tutorial sessions. The module lays the conceptual groundwork for the design of the dissertation and enables students to appreciate the connections between epistemology and the students particular programme of study.

  This module aims to provide a background in issues and methods involved in doing environmental research, including research methods and design. To achieve this, the module consists of a series of lectures, seminars, and practicals giving an overview of methods in designing, analyzing, presenting and evaluating environmental research. A subcomponent of this module will be an additional unassessed but required set of practicals and seminars giving a overview of laboratory and field equipment available in the KCL Department of Geography. On completion of this module, the student will be able to define the features of environmental problems and will be able to assess environmental investigations in terms of their design strategies for collection of data, data analysis, and results presentation. When taken with SG/5111 the students will be fully equipped to carry out their own independent research into environmental problems using these methodologies.

Appreciate the potential contradictions existing between the European-derived system of delimiting state territory by linear boundaries and non-European concepts of sovereignty/non-Western notions of social and spatial organization.
Apply a range of classifications, typologies and interaction models from political geography that will aid understanding of individual international boundaries and borderlands and allow for comparative analysis.
Understand the interrelationship between the concepts of territory, sovereignty and jurisdiction in international law and its implications for the conduct of international boundary disputes.
Evaluate the potential maritime zone generating capacity of various coastal and insular features.
Gauge the extent to which boundary and territorial disputes are used to symbolise wider differences between states.

  This module is organised around three main themes that have been central to the way that thinkers have conceptualised the city: shape, circulation and crowds. Shape refers to the physical form and layout of the city which together comprise its legibility; circulation refers to the importance of movement, networks and transactional spaces in the city; and the crowd refers to the significance of anonymity and numbers of people in cities. Each of these themes is explored in the context of different theoretical approaches that have been important in the history of urban thought.

  The module enables students to adopt a critical approach to the relationships between the environment, agricultural production and change and political ecology in southern Africa. It covers the agricultural and environmental characteristics of the southern African region, including both the small-scale and large-scale agricultural sectors, and the discourses and debates about how these should be interpreted and analysed.  It provides a strong appreciation of how structural factors such as land alienation and migrancy influence contemporary agricultural performance, and the significance of indigenous knowledge and the limitations of technocratic solutions.  The module also addresses critically the philosophy behind, and empirical outcomes of, CBNRM approaches in a region rich in wildlife and national parks.

  This module introduces students to contemporary and historical mechanisms for boundary territorial dispute resolution. Provide a practical understanding of the manner in which the World Courts gain jurisdiction to try territorial/boundary disputes and of the manner by which they have resolved them to date. Facilitate an appreciation of the range of underlying issues that characterise contemporary individual territorial disputes, from complex issues of decolonisation, through partition and secession to attempted annexation. Review in detail recent cases of international boundary settlement on land and sea, reached through remodule to bilateral negotiations, arbitration or judicial settlement and appreciate the arguments, principles and evidentiary issues that prevailed. Provide a basic familiarity with the types of primary evidence used in boundary territorial settlement before the international courts, typically documentary and cartographic materials held in the major London repositories.

  After charting the growth and development of tourism at a global level and also within countries of the South, the module adopts an analytical approach, examining the impact of power relations and risk on tourism development at different scales in developing countries. It examines the different roles played by different interest groups in the industry and the inter-relationship between these groups. It analyses the advantages and disadvantages of tourism on economies of the South and examines possible ways of bringing theory and practice in tourism together in the pursuit of socio-economic development.

 The module aims to critically explore the politics and practices of &lsquo;ecotourism&rsquo;. It draws on diverse work in social theory, political ecology and related approaches to outline a range of critical lenses for approaching ecotourism. The potential of these critical lenses is illustrated through investigations of key issues in ecotourism, which are grounded in examples of ecotourism in practice in Spain, Mexico, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.

  This module aims to provide key knowledge and understanding of the urban atmospheric system to support the development of sustainable environmental management strategies for cities. Specifically the module will: - identify the major atmospheric issues that are likely to compromise the sustainability of cities; critically assess the relevance and utility of current environmental legislation in the context of urban atmospheric management and sustainability; critically examine current knowledge concerning the measurement and modelling of the flows of energy (heat) and mass (water and gases) between the urban surface and the atmosphere as a basis for understanding urban atmospheric dynamics and managing the outcomes of urbanisation; identify the nature of urban atmospheric science required to serve urban sustainability policy needs.

  This practical module will provide masters students with hands on experience working with selected urban research organisations (e.g. national and local government departments, museums, urban think tanks) involved in urban-based research, policy formulation and implementation in a major city (normally expected to be London). The module will enable students to ground theoretical and conceptual issues relating to urban research in a practical setting.

Assessing urban growth patterns in this region and its periodization and the changing nature of rural-urban migration and linkages over time. The constraints on planning and servicing imposed by extreme resource constraints and the privatization encouraged by structural adjustment are evaluated. The module also explores the specificities of the urban experience in southern African countries with their legacies of institutionalised and racially-based influx control.

  This module provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the recent history of water resource allocation and management especially in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Priority will be given to outlining a conceptual framework identifying the relevant underlying ecological, economic and sociological principles relevant in the evaluation and management of water resources. The conceptual framework will also show the link between these underlying principles and environmental and economic policies. The roles of the institutions and technologies through which such policies can be implemented will also be analysed and exemplified.
