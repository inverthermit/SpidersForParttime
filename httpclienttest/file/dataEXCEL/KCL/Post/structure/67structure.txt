  This module focuses on core clinical competencies (skills) necessary in undertaking CBT. This covers cognitive models, maintenance and developmental conceptualisations of cases and the core aspects of the cognitive and behavioural process of therapy. Weekly clinical workshops address the most up-to-date evidence for the effectiveness of CBT and provide direct training in applying CBT to straightforward cases. These workshops are facilitated by experts in the field and consist of information giving, role-play and experiential exercises, and case demonstrations. Experiential exercises encourage self-reflection, increase in self-awareness and skill acquisition. Skills include the development of a collaborative &ndash; empirical approach to change: developing a cognitive conceptualisation, delivering a CBT rationale for treatment, agenda setting and structuring of sessions, cognitive techniques for changing beliefs and appraisals that influence behaviour and emotion. Separate sessions are also included with a focus on therapists' beliefs.

The Fundamentals Module also focuses on delivering a systematic knowledge of the fundamental principles of CBT. This includes the cognitive theory of emotion, the role of experimental psychopathology, the scientific principles and evidence base for the application of CBT models and techniques. Journal Clubs encourage the development of critical thinking and a critical understanding of the theoretical and research evidence for cognitive models and an ability to evaluate the evidence. The course aims to be integrative in its approach to enable students to have an understanding of how the scientific principles inform CBT clinical practice. The weekly clinical workshops provide students with a strong foundation in the evidence base for CBT, and address the most up-to-date research developments. In addition to the weekly workshops, students have a journal club and specific workshop focusing on Evaluating Research in CBT.

  This module aims to develop skills in CBT for anxiety to an advanced level, improving proficiency in the fundamental techniques of CBT, and developing competency in the specialist techniques applied to anxiety. Specific models, evidence base, assessment and specialist treatment strategies will be covered in workshops on anxiety disorders such as Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, PTSD, GAD and Health Anxiety. The clinical workshops will also provide students with a strong foundation in the evidence base for working with CBT and anxiety, and address the most up-to-date research developments.

The Anxiety Module will also focus on delivering a critical understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostic classifications and epidemiological characteristics of anxiety disorders, competency in assessing patients for suitability for CBT with anxiety, constructing maintenance and developmental conceptualisations of cases of anxiety and developing and implementing CBT treatment plans for a range of anxiety disorders. It will enable students to evaluate the theoretical evidence based interventions integrated within and guiding therapy with anxiety. The anxiety workshops will be facilitated by world renowned experts in CBT such as Professor David Clark and Professor Anke Ehlers. Students will also be supported in making best use of supervision with anxiety disorders on the course.

The clinical workshops will also provide students with a strong foundation in the evidence base for working with CBT and Depression, and address the most up-to-date research developments.

The Depression Module will also focus on developing a critical understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostic classifications and epidemiological characteristics of depressive disorders, assessing patients with depression, taking into account clinical manifestations, co-morbidity, past history, present life situation, course and outcome of depression in suitability for CBT, assessing risk factors associated with depression and the integration of risk management within treatment plans, constructing both cognitive and behavioural development and maintenance formulations in cases of depression and developing and implementing cognitive and behavioural treatment plans for depression.
