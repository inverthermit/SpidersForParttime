      Cellular And Molecular Neuroscience (30 Credits) - Required

  The student will understand the cellular and molecular basis of neurological disease. A background on normal molecular mechanisms and cell biology underlying neuronal function will be given, followed by an exploration of the interaction of pharmaceutical agents with neuronal receptors and the clinical effects expected. A background on genetics and gene-hunting techniques will be given and an exploration of genetic defects and the insights this gives to neurological disease mechanisms. The student will understand the basis of therapeutics. The student will understand the principles of neuronal function. The student will understand genetics and how genes relate to neural proteins and function.
The programme provides knowledge and understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of neuronal function, an overview of neurophysiology on a cellular level, neurogenetics, population genetics and pharmacogenetics, and an understanding of pharmacotherapeutics on a molecular level. Students will understand how this relates to neurological disease, allowing them to understand the scientific principles of clinical neuroscience, identify multiple ways to solve a clinical problem and critically assess the evidence for and against interventions or treatments. Students will therefore be able to identify relevant information from a variety of sources and order and interpret appropriate investigations and treatments.
Assessment is by a two-hour unseen examination, a 2000-word essay (each worth 50% of the final grade for this module).

  The educational aims of this module are to enable the student to: conduct an independent small research project; collect, collate and analyse primary and secondary data; develop the skills required to evaluate literature and critically assess evidence base; acquire an appropriate level of statistical knowledge and the ability to apply this; understand how to discuss and explain methodology specific to a research project; develop writing skills and an understanding of the logical flow of a thesis.
At the end of the module, the student will have demonstrated the ability to: conduct an independent small research project; collect, collate, analyse primary and secondary data; evaluate literature and critically assess evidence base; demonstrate an advanced level of application of statistical tests to a data set; discuss and explain methodology specific to a research project; write up research findings and arrive at informed conclusions.
Assessment is by a 10,000-word dissertation, which accounts for 100% of the final grade for this module.

  The student will understand the methods and interpretation of clinical signs and symptoms in neurological disease. A background on history taking and interpretation, examination, examination findings and their interpretation, and the tools available to neurologists for the investigation of neurological disease will be given. The emphasis will be on neuroimaging, but neurophysiology, immunology and pathology will be included. Students will understand the use and interpretation of neurological investigative tools and their relationship with the underlying lesion or functional disturbance. Therapeutics will be discussed at a mechanistic level and in clinical practice.
The programme provides a knowledge and understanding of the methods and interpretation of symptoms, signs and investigations used in neurological disease. This will include effective history taking, correct examination technique, and the diagnostic logic used to arrive at a diagnosis. The use of neuroimaging, neurophysiology and psychological investigations in coming to a diagnosis will be understood. The therapeutic options available and their mechanisms will be understood.

  The educational aims of this module are to gain advanced knowledge and understanding of research design and methodology. A background will be given on the procedures required to plan, develop and run a research project, with an emphasis on clinical trials. Ethics, grant-writing, project design, analysis and interpretation will be explored. Students will understand the issues in undertaking research.
The programme provides students with knowledge and understanding of the methods required to undertake a research project, including the ethical approval process, R D requirements, grant writing, study design and publishing. Students will understand the methods that lead to the generation of hypotheses through critical evaluation of existing knowledge, the design of studies to test the hypotheses generated, the evaluation of study designs in published data, and the critical evaluation of research papers required for advanced learning.

  The student will understand the anatomical basis of symptoms reported by patients and signs elicited by the examiner. A background in neuroanatomy will be given starting with single neurons and progressing to networks and tracts. The relationship between disruption of neural function either in individual neurons or in networks will be explored, and the symptoms and signs this is expected to produce will be discussed. The student will understand the relationship between clinical findings and underlying anatomical lesions.
The programme provides a knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of neurological disease, allowing students to understand the scientific principles of clinical neuroscience, identify multiple ways to solve a clinical problem and critically assess the evidence for and against interventions or treatments. Students will therefore be able to identify relevant information from a variety of sources and order and interpret appropriate investigations and treatments.
