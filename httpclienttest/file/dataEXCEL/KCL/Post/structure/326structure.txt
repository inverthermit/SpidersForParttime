  This module enables students to undertake a substantial written project relevant to their field of practice. Students draw on learning and skills acquired in the taught components of the MSc programme. The module offers a choice of one of three options: an analysis of an area of healthcare provision, an empirical study, or a systematic review.
Students are supported in their project work through guidance from a designated supervisor. Additionally, all students, once enrolled, have access to group online tutorials via discussion boards situated within the module e-Learning site. The online discussion boards provide a medium where queries can be addressed and suggestions offered by both fellow students and the module leader.

  This course aims to equip you with the skills and knowledge required to identify best evidence for your practice. It focuses on searching for, appraising and synthesising evidence from health care research. You are introduced to a range of electronic databases for accessing evidence and the principles of systematic review. Learning is facilitated through lectures, workshops and a student-directed search for evidence to address a question emerging from your own practice. Issues surrounding research implementation and evidence at the level of the individual practitioner and the health care organisation are addressed. Assessment is by means of a review of literature which answers a focussed question utilising explicit methods.

  This module aims to provide students with a broad knowledge of the key research approaches and techniques used in healthcare research. It intends to promote students&rsquo; understanding of published articles and enhance skills of critical analysis and enhance skills for critiquing research articles. Further it aims to promote the development of skills required to undertake a research-based project in the future. This module is a good stepping stone to Master's level work for those who have studied research methods at level 6 and those who would benefit from revision of this knowledge. It will consider philosophical bases for research, traditions and features of qualitative and quantitative research designs, data collection tools used in qualitative and quantitative research and analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. This module is a precursor for the second research methods module, &lsquo;Issues in the Conduct of Healthcare Research&rsquo;
