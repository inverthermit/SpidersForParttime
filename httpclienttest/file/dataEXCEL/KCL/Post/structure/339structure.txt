  This module enables students to derive a greater understanding of the relationship between methodology and method and the related notions of epistemology and ontology. The module is a mix of lectures and tutorials and enables students to develop skills in the appropriate use and application of quantitative and qualitative methods, which will have been worked through in tutorial sessions. The module lays the conceptual groundwork for the design of the dissertation and enables students to appreciate the connections between epistemology and the students particular programme of study.

The module aims:
To provide the students with a history of the risk perception literature with a focus on both natural and technological hazards;  
To develop an understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of risk communication;  
To examine the successes and failures of risk communication programmes in both Europe and North America; and  
To develop an understanding of how regulators, policy makers and industry use risk communication techniques in every day policy making.

To develop an understanding and knowledge of risk assessment concepts and tools,  
To develop an understanding and knowledge on the uses of risk assessment in government and industry,  
To develop an understanding of the application of risk assessment concepts and tools to human health, environmental and site-specific hazards,  
To evaluate the ability of risk assessment tools to achieve their objectives, and  
To develop understanding on the role and function of risk assessment tools in decision-making.

  This module aims to develop a critical understanding appropriate of how theoretical risk analysis is operationalised by industry and government. This practical module will provide students with experience working with selected industrial, government or regulatory actors (e.g. multinational companies, national and European government policy-making departments and arms-length regulators) involved in risk analysis, management and governance in the UK and Europe. The module will enable students to validate and question risk theories and assumptions explored elsewhere in the degree. It will also provide vital practical experience for future employment.
 The course aims:
To develop understanding on the development of risk policy,
To evaluate techniques for rational decision-making on risk issues,
To develop understanding of risk management decision-making based upon different deliberative approaches such as epistemological, reflective and participatory discourses,
To develop knowledge and understanding on risk governance structures, and
To develop understanding of risk regulation regimes.
