      1  3 hour examination  (100%)
     
  The module will appeal to students with interdisciplinary interests in (socio)linguistics, social anthropology, social psychology, media and cultural studies. The main aim is to draw on the cross-fertilizations of those areas to examine critically the interrelationships between language, identity and culture, as attested to both at the level of theorizing and at the level of empirical work. More specifically, the module will demonstrate the role of language in the reproduction but also construction of social and cultural practices and relations. To do so, it will look into case studies of language use in a variety of communication contexts ranging from small group to organizational and mediated communication. It will also refer to studies of the examined phenomena in different cultures, societies, speech and language communities, with the aim of providing students with further insights.

      Two essays (one 4,000 word ethnographic essay and one 2,000 word data elicitation task
     
  This module covers methods for research on spoken language data, including basic procedures such as transcription, linguistics techniques (elicitation of linguistic structures, grammaticality assessments), basic sociolinguistic methods (ethnographic fieldwork, transcontextual and micro-analysis), techniques of endangered language recording and preservation. It thus introduces students to social, cultural and cognitive research perspectives on language and speech.

      Brief for 5,000 word project
Select/collect narrative data (e.g. audio-recorded conversations, interviews, questionnaires, printed or electronic media material) and apply tools and modes of narrative analysis so as to conduct a study either a particular linguistic/interactional choice (device) in them or the relations amongst different linguistic/interactional choices with a view to uncovering links between such choices and the teller(s) identities (or identity aspects). Write up your analysis (questions and objectives, data and methods, analytical tools, findings).
     
  The study of narrative represents a diverse and interdisciplinary area of enormous
consequence both methodologically and analytically for the humanities and social
sciences. This module is specifically aimed at delving into linguistically informed
approaches to narrative (e.g. social pragmatics, discourse analysis, interactional
sociolinguistics). It will discuss a representative range of narrative theories,
foreground their links with related areas (e.g. narrative psychology, literary
theory), where appropriate, and above all provide students with a toolkit for the
analysis of narrative. The discussion and presentation of narrative approaches will
be complemented by close analysis of a variety of narrative texts (spoken, written,
multi-modal) but emphasis will be placed on non-literary oral narratives, more
specifically a) narrative data as research methodology (i.e. life stories mostly
elicited through interviews) and b) interactional narratives occurring in ordinary
conversational contexts.

  This module is designed for students committed to pursuing MPhil/PhD research, and it enables them carry out a limited piece of empirical analysis, working under the supervision of a tutor who has worked on broadly the same data. The student is provided with a manageable dataset and some relevant texts, and they are then required to identify their own research question, to re-process the data in ways that relate to their question, to conduct the analysis (noting strengths   weaknesses), and to write a report and archive the reprocessed data. The student is also required to attend any MPhil/PhD data sessions running concurrently.
The module involves less classroom contact time than other modules, and requires a high level of self-organisation on the part of students, who would also benefit from some prior experience of empirical data analysis. It runs by special request and with prior agreement of the tutor involved. If you are interested, please contact Prof Ben Rampton.

  All students need to be able to meet the linguistic demands of a course of study and this need is critical if they are studying in a second or foreign language. This course focuses on the central problem of written communication in academic contexts, and gives participants an opportunity to develop an understanding of the language and teaching issues that are central to EAP programmes. The course draws on a range of important theoretical and descriptive frameworks in building an account of how best we can help EAP students in particular functional systemic linguistics, genre analysis, and corpus linguistics. It also give practical insights into how to use this understanding in preparing practical courses for students studying in English. Apart from this focus on teaching writing, this course gives students the chance to focus on important issues in EAP in particular: preparing for the IELTS test, study skills, needs analysis and the management of EAP courses.

  This module scrutinises the 'standard' principles and theories of language teaching against the backdrop of the socio-political context of ESOL/ESL in the UK, and other English dominant settings such as the USA, Canada and Australia. It places the teaching of migrants in the broader contexts of globalisation, 'superdiversity' and public policy, with particular reference to the backgrounds of adult migrants and ESOL/ESL teachers. We will explore some key social theories, eg theories of identity, Bourdieu's theory of capital, which have been applied to English language teaching and learning in English dominant settings.

  This module aims to extend students&rsquo; understanding of the key theories that underpin modern foreign language teaching and learning and to explore how these concepts can be applied effectively in different language teaching practices and contexts represented by students in the group. Topics include a critical approach to the communicative language teaching, new insights into learner motivation, the increasingly important topic of learning/learner strategies, content-based language learning, collaborative learning and the linguistic and cultural representations modelled through film in the classroom. Students, having examined a range of teaching and learning approaches and the underlying theoretical precepts, will relate these to their own cultural and educational contexts. The module is interactive, being based on active learning methods and is very student-focused. The session formats are varied and involve both personal reflection and collaborative study as we learn together as a learning group. All sessions draw on data collected by students for the session in order to develop research skills. Key texts are identified for each session and draw on a wide range of international research. Students choose to focus on a related topic in greater depth for their end-of-module essay which is agreed by the module tutor. Support is provided for assignment writing.

  This module addresses a number of perspectives on the relationship between language and power. It sets up a dialogue between theories and methods from social theory, critical discourse analysis, interactional sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. It examines the dynamics of language and power in, for example, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, education, informal, institutional   mass-mediated discourse, and global and local interaction. The module also helps students to conduct their own analyses. By the end of this module, participants will have an understanding of relations of language and power in a wide range of domains and communicative settings, and an understanding of how relevant research approaches might be practically applied.

  In the contemporary world, people are saying that language and discourse are now more important than ever before, and across the Humanities and Social Sciences, there has been a major &lsquo;discursive/linguistic turn&rsquo;. Instead of trying to identify the central, stable features that characterise different individuals, groups or &lsquo;cultures&rsquo;, researchers are now much more interested in trying to establish the ways in which language and discourse are used to construct cultural difference and social identity, both in face-to-face interaction and in public representations.
So this module looks at the debates about the role that language places in power, ideology, resistance and social change, and considers several major 20th century cultural theorists, such as Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault and Erving Goffman.

  This module covers various aspects of how research has attempted to explore and delineate the interaction between language and mind. In the course of our discussions, we will aim to familiarise the group with a variety of theories that have driven much of the research in this field. In addition, the potentials and limitations of research methods will form a significant part of our discussions. In the past, research has been focussed on Western languages, mainly English, ignoring the majority of people in the world, who speak one or more non-English languages. We will discuss the consequences of equating language and mind processes across the world and attempt to uncover the nuances of more recent research that addresses the ways speakers of different languages think. One of our main goals is to highlight the ways that theoretical perspectives and research methods can both guide and blind researchers to the conclusions they draw from their studies.

  The analysis of communication on social media is rapidly becoming a key-area in  (socio)linguistics and discourse studies. This module introduces you to the main  methods of data collection and analysis of language and discourse for a variety of  social media contexts. The module combines familiarisation with frameworks of  analysis with practical steps on how to approach data. A variety of case-studies of  social media afforded practices (e.g. sharing, tagging, Like and Follow) ranging  from YouTube to Facebook and Twitter illustrate the role of a range of language  and multimodal resources in presenting ourselves and relating with others online.  Throughout the module, you will be encouraged to bring in your own experiences  of social media engagements and gradually put together your own technolinguistic  biography.

  Linguistic Politeness looks at different ways of conceptualizing politeness; from folk definitions and lay perceptions of what constitutes polite language and behaviour to politeness theories. It introduces you to pragmatic and discursive approaches to politeness, as well as having a strong practical component which will involve investigating how politeness can be best captured in everyday interaction and compared across groups. We will discuss different types of data and different methodologies and cover the full range of politeness phenomena, including impoliteness.

      3,500 word assignment
     
  This course will give participants a better idea of the role of materials within the ELT curriculum, and provide them with tools to investigate learners' needs, plan courses for ESP and General English classes, and analyse, design and adapt tasks and materials for their students. The course builds on work already done in all the previous courses, especially on task-based instruction and SLA, descriptions of English, curriculum design and pedagogy. Participants will have the opportunity to apply theory and principles from these earlier courses and put them to practical use. 
 This is a theory-informed practice oriented course and quite a large part of class time will be used for workshops where participants will work together in pairs and groups, evaluating, adapting and designing materials, and planning courses based on the needs of their students, with the help of the tutors. Some of the outputs from these workshops may be included in participants' assignments. Participants will be expected to find time between sessions to do further work on materials development tasks that they start in the workshop sessions, in addition to reading the key texts. It is also recommended that during the course participants spend some time looking carefully at published materials as a source of ideas on content, topics, task types, layout and design, methodology and syllabus. The assignment for this course can be in the form of a piece of professional work in materials design or materials evaluation, rather than a traditional academic essay.

  This module offers an introduction to the role of discourse in health, illness and medical practice. Discourse analysis explores social life through the analysis of language in its widest sense (including verbal interaction, non-verbal, images, symbols, documents). In this module, we will study genres of language including case reports, scientific papers, drug advertisements and media health stories, as well as interaction in consultations. There will be a particular focus on introducing students to relevant methods in the study of medical discourses.

  This is an optional module that provides an introduction to principles and applications of Psychology to Learning in formal and informal contexts. Over the last three decades, psychological theories and explanation of learning have developed far beyond simple, mechanistic models (such as reinforcement) that are applied in formal settings (especially schools). Within this module, participants will have the opportunity to explore: individual and social circumstances that may promote or hinder learning; characteristics of learning in formal and informal contexts; and individual and social theories of learning. Further, the module will explore how theories of learning have been adapted and ignored in education policies: at pre-school, primary and secondary school levels; with regard to curriculum; and with regard to assessment. In considering explanations of learning, the module will consider issues of development, multiple intelligences, interpersonal support that underlies learning and the effect of culture/activity on learning experience.

      1 report of 4500 words on a language learning experience (65% of the assessment), plus 15 minute oral presentation (35% of the assessment)
     
  The module will explore the nature of language acquisition and learning primarily from a second language perspective, but it will also look at aspects of first language acquisition in order to better understand the challenges of learning a second language. It will introduce students to key concepts in psycholinguistics and the role of the brain, the mind and memory in language learning. It will provide insights into how languages are learned by both children and adults.
The module will provide students with an extensive overview of SLA theory and research, identifying key trends and principles relevant to both classroom-based and informal pedagogies. It will explore the individual and social processes involved in the development and use of a second language, highlighting how in contrast to more conventional approaches to the field, SLA can be framed within a bi/multilingual development perspective. It will explore the ongoing debate between theorists adopting a psycho-cognitive perspective and those adopting sociolinguistic perspectives.
Throughout the module students will be encourage to evaluate critically established psycholinguistic and SLA theories in light of their own experience of language learning and teaching, and to apply these to a range of contexts in order to describe and explain the key issues involved. They will undertake a language learning experience which they will report on as part of the assessment for the course.
The course will cover the following key issues:
The relation between the brain, cognition and language;
How language is produced, both in spoken and written from, and how it is understood;
Similarities and differences between first and second language acquisition;
The roles of explicit and implicit learning of language;
Input and output hypotheses;
Form and meaning focussed learning;
Task-based interaction;
Socio-cultural theories in SLA;
Motivation in language learning;
Learner identities

  For teachers who have little or no experience of teacher training, this course will provide a thorough overview of the field and introduce participants to the key issues. For those who are already teacher educators or responsible for teacher development in a managerial role the objective will be to extend and deepen knowledge and understanding of the central issues in teacher training, education and continued professional development in English language pedagogy. The course will familiarize participants with the relevant literature and encourage critical evaluation of this in the light of individual experience in order to develop awareness of the key choices available to a teacher educator in terms of approaches, methods and materials. This will involve the development of teacher training skills through collaborative workshops and through simulated teacher supervision and evaluation. 
 In addition to discussion of teacher education literature, there will be consideration of recent developments in applied linguistics. This will involve reflection on the implication of these with regard to the nature of curricula in existing teacher education programmes, and in relation to the planning and implementation of training/education/development initiatives in different teaching contexts.

  Professionals with an interest in genre analysis, discourse analysis, cultural studies, materials development, ESP course development, or the study of literature need to understand how to work with texts.
This module is designed for students who are interested in developing analytic skills which will enable them to engage with texts for use in language teaching, applied linguistics or literary research. Drawing on techniques drawn from corpus linguistics, students will learn how to make practical use of commercial and open sources text analysis programs in linguistic and social research, or materials development in language education.
Although written texts will be the major focus of the option module, students will also be able to use the the tools and techniques they have learned how to use in the analysis of spoken texts.
