  This course looks at principles and theories which develop from and underpin the practice of language teaching. Its aims are to provide students with an advanced level understanding of how key theories of language (such as communicative competence) and key theories of learning (such as the behaviourist theory of learning) are related to approaches to language teaching; provide students with a critical overview of different approaches and methods in the field of language teaching, and conceptual frameworks for analysing, comparing and evaluating approaches and methods; provide students with a theoretically-informed understanding of the concept of a language education curriculum and how it relates to language teaching in different contexts; enable students to critically evaluate the following dimensions of the curriculum with reference to established perspectives: Syllabus Design, Learning Activities, Materials Design, Classroom Management, Roles of teachers and learners Curriculum development and renewal processes.
It will also enable students to use current theoretical frameworks to critically analyse their own professional practice, and identify areas and directions for development.

      1 report of 4500 words on a language learning experience (65% of the assessment), plus 15 minute oral presentation (35% of the assessment)
     
  The module will explore the nature of language acquisition and learning primarily from a second language perspective, but it will also look at aspects of first language acquisition in order to better understand the challenges of learning a second language. It will introduce students to key concepts in psycholinguistics and the role of the brain, the mind and memory in language learning. It will provide insights into how languages are learned by both children and adults.
The module will provide students with an extensive overview of SLA theory and research, identifying key trends and principles relevant to both classroom-based and informal pedagogies. It will explore the individual and social processes involved in the development and use of a second language, highlighting how in contrast to more conventional approaches to the field, SLA can be framed within a bi/multilingual development perspective. It will explore the ongoing debate between theorists adopting a psycho-cognitive perspective and those adopting sociolinguistic perspectives.
Throughout the module students will be encourage to evaluate critically established psycholinguistic and SLA theories in light of their own experience of language learning and teaching, and to apply these to a range of contexts in order to describe and explain the key issues involved. They will undertake a language learning experience which they will report on as part of the assessment for the course.
The course will cover the following key issues:
The relation between the brain, cognition and language;
How language is produced, both in spoken and written from, and how it is understood;
Similarities and differences between first and second language acquisition;
The roles of explicit and implicit learning of language;
Input and output hypotheses;
Form and meaning focussed learning;
Task-based interaction;
Socio-cultural theories in SLA;
Motivation in language learning;
Learner identities

  All students need to be able to meet the linguistic demands of a course of study and this need is critical if they are studying in a second or foreign language. This course focuses on the central problem of written communication in academic contexts, and gives participants an opportunity to develop an understanding of the language and teaching issues that are central to EAP programmes. The course draws on a range of important theoretical and descriptive frameworks in building an account of how best we can help EAP students in particular functional systemic linguistics, genre analysis, and corpus linguistics. It also give practical insights into how to use this understanding in preparing practical courses for students studying in English. Apart from this focus on teaching writing, this course gives students the chance to focus on important issues in EAP in particular: preparing for the IELTS test, study skills, needs analysis and the management of EAP courses.

  This module scrutinises the 'standard' principles and theories of language teaching against the backdrop of the socio-political context of ESOL/ESL in the UK, and other English dominant settings such as the USA, Canada and Australia. It places the teaching of migrants in the broader contexts of globalisation, 'superdiversity' and public policy, with particular reference to the backgrounds of adult migrants and ESOL/ESL teachers. We will explore some key social theories, eg theories of identity, Bourdieu's theory of capital, which have been applied to English language teaching and learning in English dominant settings.

  This course will give participants a better idea of the role of materials within the ELT curriculum, and provide them with tools to investigate learners' needs, plan courses for ESP and General English classes, and analyse, design and adapt tasks and materials for their students. The course builds on work already done in all the previous courses, especially on task-based instruction and SLA, descriptions of English, curriculum design and pedagogy. Participants will have the opportunity to apply theory and principles from these earlier courses and put them to practical use. 
 This is a theory-informed practice oriented course and quite a large part of class time will be used for workshops where participants will work together in pairs and groups, evaluating, adapting and designing materials, and planning courses based on the needs of their students, with the help of the tutors. Some of the outputs from these workshops may be included in participants' assignments. Participants will be expected to find time between sessions to do further work on materials development tasks that they start in the workshop sessions, in addition to reading the key texts. It is also recommended that during the course participants spend some time looking carefully at published materials as a source of ideas on content, topics, task types, layout and design, methodology and syllabus. The assignment for this course can be in the form of a piece of professional work in materials design or materials evaluation, rather than a traditional academic essay.

  Students will be required to draw on their experience reflexively in order to relate ideas from the course and from their reading to the practice of CLT in the various contexts that they are familiar with. Research on the nature of the skills of listening, reading, writing and speaking in a second/foreign language, will be critically examined together with research into the processes and strategies involved in acquiring these skills. Students will have the opportunity to relate current issues in teaching the language skills to their own contexts, through discussions and tasks in class as well as through the assessed coursework essays. Students will be able to choose an assignment title which focuses on one or more of the key topics covered, or they can negotiate their own title relating principles to practice in a specific context.

  For teachers who have little or no experience of teacher training, this course will provide a thorough overview of the field and introduce participants to the key issues. For those who are already teacher educators or responsible for teacher development in a managerial role the objective will be to extend and deepen knowledge and understanding of the central issues in teacher training, education and continued professional development in English language pedagogy. The course will familiarize participants with the relevant literature and encourage critical evaluation of this in the light of individual experience in order to develop awareness of the key choices available to a teacher educator in terms of approaches, methods and materials. This will involve the development of teacher training skills through collaborative workshops and through simulated teacher supervision and evaluation. 
 In addition to discussion of teacher education literature, there will be consideration of recent developments in applied linguistics. This will involve reflection on the implication of these with regard to the nature of curricula in existing teacher education programmes, and in relation to the planning and implementation of training/education/development initiatives in different teaching contexts.

  Professionals with an interest in genre analysis, discourse analysis, cultural studies, materials development, ESP course development, or the study of literature need to understand how to work with texts.
This module is designed for students who are interested in developing analytic skills which will enable them to engage with texts for use in language teaching, applied linguistics or literary research. Drawing on techniques drawn from corpus linguistics, students will learn how to make practical use of commercial and open sources text analysis programs in linguistic and social research, or materials development in language education.
Although written texts will be the major focus of the option module, students will also be able to use the the tools and techniques they have learned how to use in the analysis of spoken texts.
