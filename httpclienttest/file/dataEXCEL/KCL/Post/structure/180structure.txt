      This module is assessed by written examination (70%) and coursework (30%).
The coursework consists of preparation and presentation of a poster (15%) and preparation and presentation of a research paper (15%)
     
  This module is designed to acquaint students with fundamental cellular processes involved in the generation of an immune response. It will provide students with detailed knowledge of the cells and organs of the immune system, their organisation and diversity, and their specialised functions at different anatomical locations. The importance of immune cell receptors and cytokines in cellular interactions and co-ordination of immunological mechanisms is also emphasised. The lectures will be supported by study groups and problem-based formative exercises which students will be asked to complete in class, or through individual study. Assessment is by written examination, poster and journal preparation.

      The research project is assessed by  
Preparation of research project report (100%)
     
  The aim of the experimental project is enable students to work independently in a laboratory to an advanced level on an immunology research project. Students will undertake a six month lab based research project. In order to develop their research skills they will also attend generic research core skills training sessions and instruction in important immunological techniques. They will gain experience of attending a national Immunology Conference. They will write a research proposal and a formal scientific project report based on their laboratory work, and prepare two short seminar presentations to be given to their class on their projects. Assessment is by seminar presentation, research proposal, and dissertation.

      Assessment:  
      written examination/s;     coursework;     
   
    
    
      The module is assessed by written examinations (70%) and coursewrok which consists of a student debate (30%)
     
  This module is designed to acquaint students with structure and functional relationships of immune cell receptors. Students will acquire knowledge of structural properties of immune receptors and how these are important in receptor functions such as antigen interaction and signal transduction. In addition, the module explores how immune regulatory molecules can be designed and manipulated for use in immunotherapy of disease and novel approaches to vaccine design. The lectures will be supported by study groups and problem-based formative exercises (mainly data-interpretation) which students will be asked to complete in class, or through individual study. Assessment is by examination and coursework.

      Assessment:  
      written examination/s;     coursework;     
      This module is assessed by written examination (70%) and a supervised critical review essay (30%)
     
  This 30 credit module aims to review selected areas of immunology that relate to protective immunity against infection. This will be achieved by a series of core lectures that will deal with general mechanisms and the nature of functional immunity against selected diseases including; viral bacterial and parasite diseases. It also aims to cover immunological aspects of selected diseases that affect humans; describe in outline the clinical aspects of the conditions or diseases; deal in detail with their immunological aspects with a view to explaining how immune disorders and conditions arise, progress and may be treated. Key reading material for student private study will be identified in most lectures. Experts from outside the DIIID will deliver some of the lectures; students are urged to talk to these visitors while here, and should feel free to contact them by e-mail for further guidance if required. Assessment is by examination and coursework.
