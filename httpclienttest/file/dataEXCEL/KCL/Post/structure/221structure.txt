  Module description
This module examines core Company Law and the regulatory framework and practice on corporate governance &ndash; the system (structure and process) by which companies are governed (i.e. directed and controlled), and to what purpose (i.e. what overriding value is promoted). Although some commentators allude to convergence in corporate governance, no global corporate governance model exists as yet. Companies operate primarily within boundaries prescribed by national laws and regulations whilst also ensuring that they are compliant with applicable extra-territorial norms. Consequently, a key objective of this course is to examine UK corporate governance regulation, as the primary model, against the background of other models that exist internationally.
Topics included are: the nature of corporate governance and foundational concepts such as corporate personality and limited shareholder liability; veil impairment and the constitutional &lsquo;law&rsquo; of the company, directors&rsquo; duties; shareholder protection; effective board leadership; remuneration control; and shareholder engagement.

  Module description
This module, which was introduced by David Hayton and Paul Matthews in 1995, was the first of its kind in the world and deals with trusts in the international context. Reflecting on King's strong reputation in trust and comparative law, it examines the extremes to which trust principles may be pressed in the offshore world, as well as conflicts of laws issues. The module considers how three trust jurisdictions deal with selected aspects of trust law and what trust-like arrangements exist in non-trust countries. You are not required to have studied trust law formally in your first degree but will be assumed to understand trust law at the ordinary undergraduate level, or to be prepared to reach this level during the year. Students from civil law systems can &ndash; and do &ndash; take this module.

  Module description

The teaching part of this module takes place over two terms. The first term comprises a thorough grounding in the theory and practice of international commercial arbitration. The module provides a practical insight into fundamental principles, from an international perspective, by reference to the principal conventions and model laws, and the current approaches to this field in different jurisdictions. In the second term you move on to investment treaty arbitration and other forms of substantive protection that may be available to investors. Topics on this part of the module include the investment dispute resolution facility of the ICSID Convention, and the substantive and procedural protections that may be available to investors under bilateral (BIT) or multilateral (e.g. NAFTA) investment treaties.
All students will attend both parts of the module. The basic format entails one two-hour lecture per week, with a number of &lsquo;cross-over&rsquo; seminars over the two terms in which the interplay between these two areas of international arbitration is explored. There will also be a number of tutorials given throughout the year for which you will be expected to submit written work. In the summer term, you will have the opportunity to prepare a dissertation or research essay for submission. There will also be the possibility to participate in practical &ldquo;moot&rdquo; sessions, alongside formal classes.

  Module description

The module covers the key components of the public international law related to the protection of foreign investment. Reference is made to relevant customary and conventional international law (particularly bilateral investment treaties), as well as to relevant regional and municipal law. The module is concerned with the substantive normative framework of the international law relating to foreign investment (procedural aspects are addressed in the course on International Commercial Arbitration). It also addresses the key legal obligations of the host State (MFN, National Treatment, Expropriation, Fair and Equitable Treatment, Transparency) as well as the legal obligations of the foreign investor. Policy considerations underlying this area of the law will also be examined.

  This module aims at providing students with the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of the international investment law and policy regime. Students will have to develop an awareness of the critical legal issues in the current regime, including the substantive protections afforded to foreign investors and the dispute settlement mechanisms provided by the system. Policy considerations underlying this area of the law will be examined as international investment law broadly limits States&rsquo; regulatory prerogatives in many important and sensitive economic sectors such as energy, transportation, water services.
As the practice project will be different every year, during the first seminar, we will provide more details on the specific project.
While strictly speaking there is no pre-requisite for the course, we strongly suggest enrolling in either the International Commercial and Investment Arbitration or International Investment Law modules.

  Module description
This module considers taxation in an international context. Domestic tax systems have increasingly had to respond to globalisation so that taxation can still be viable in an environment where activities which have traditionally attracted taxation can be carried out without domestic borders to define their scope. The module will consider taxation and international law in general and then move on to looking at the ways in which domestic systems have sought to deal with double taxation where activities attracting taxation are carried out over more than one country &ndash; namely through double taxation conventions. The focus will be on the OECD Model and double taxation conventions based on this and why international business gives tax systems a problem and how this can be addressed.

  Module description
A contract for the sale of goods lies at the heart of and is central to commercial law. Similarly, an international sales contract is a key international commercial transaction which often gives rise to several interrelated legal arrangements. They are the arrangements with a bank for the payment or finance of the purchase price, contracts of carriage of goods and marine insurance, covering the goods. This module examines: how these contracts are governed; the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties to the respective contracts; and the relationship between the sales, financing, carriage and insurance contracts. The module will address these issues on the basis of English law, which is often the preferred choice of law in international trade, and the relevant international instruments.
Part I of the course will focus on the salient features of the cross-border sale of goods contracts. It will explore in detail the rules of English law (Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the common law) governing the international sale of goods contracts. The issues covered will include: the basic concepts of English law of sale of goods; the implied terms of a sales contract (such as the implied terms of quality and description of the goods); the structure of and legal issues arising from contracts incorporating such trade terms as CIF (&lsquo;cost, insurance, freight&rsquo;) and FOB (&lsquo;free on board&rsquo;); remedies for breach of an international sales contract. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 1980 (CISG) &ndash; a leading international sales law instrument, now ratified by more than eighty countries - will also receive a substantial amount of attention. The course will address such aspects of the CISG as the scope of its application, general provisions, rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer and remedies for breach of contract governed by the CISG.
Part II will examine the key financial instruments and methods of payment used in international trade. These instruments are used either to enable payments in the underlying transaction or to provide a guarantee in the case of a breach of the underlying transaction. The instruments covered in this course are collections, documentary credits (letters of credit) and autonomous bank guarantees. The key international instruments covered in this course have all been produced by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and include: Uniform Rules for Collections (URC 522; 1995 revision); Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 2007 (the UCP 600); Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG 758; 2010 revision); International Standby Practices (ISP98).
Part III of the course examines legal issues arising from the need to transport the goods by sea (the main mode of transport in international trade) and how contracts for the carriage of goods by sea are governed. The issues addressed in this part of the course will be: the common rules implied in contracts of carriage; the voyage and time charterparties; bills of lading; the application of the Hague-Visby Rules, incorporated into English law by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. The Hague-Visby Rules are an amendment to the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading (Hague Rules, adopted 1924), incorporated in a document known as the Brussels Protocol 1968. Other international conventions, such as the UN Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea 1978 (the Hamburg Rules) and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (the Rotterdam Rules) 2008, will be touched upon briefly.
Part IV will be concerned with the fundamentals of the marine cargo insurance contracts. The examination will be based on the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the Institute Cargo Clauses and Insurance Act 2015. This part is intended to introduce students to the marine insurance contracts and aims to examine the origins, functions and role of insurance generally and of marine insurance in particular as well as their linkages with risk taking as the main catalyst for commercial ventures and economic development. The issues covered in this part will include: an introduction to the marine insurance law and practice; insurable interest in the subject-matter insured; the doctrines of utmost good faith, disclosure and representations; warranties; perils covered by the marine insurance policy; claim for indemnity.

  This module (together with the International Finance 2 and the International Finance 3) is focused on the major transactions carried out by investment banks, transnational banks and multinational corporations in the vast global financial markets which have developed in London, New York and Tokyo in recent years as well as in locations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Paris and Sydney. It is designed to examine the legal structures used in these transactions and the complex legal issues arising in the context of these transactions due to their transnational and multijurisdictional nature. Law of International Finance 1 is designed to cover the following major transactions * International Syndicated Loans * International Bonds and MTNs * Convertibles * GDRs. Regulatory law of the US and of the European Union which affects primary issues in the international capital markets will also be examined.
The three modules on the Law of International Finance are not designed to cover domestic banking law or company law in the UK or elsewhere nor is it concerned with the law affecting international trade. The orientation of this module is entirely practical and is designed to enable you to practice as a lawyer in the global financial markets whether as an attorney in the global law firms or as legal counsel with investment banks, transnational banks and multinational corporations engaging in these transactions.

  This module is intended to be taken only in conjunction with International Finance 1 and will be taught as an adjunct half module covering in detail two major international banking transactions in the markets as its centrepiece. It will first examine the legal structures used in the financing of very large scale projects (some well over several billion dollars in value) in such areas as gas and oil exploration, infrastructure projects such as airports, harbours and mass transit railway systems. It will secondly cover the vast market in loan sales and trading including distressed debt.
This module will enable those interested in pursuing a career in the transnational banking world to explore in depth the legal issues that arise in relation to large scale projects in emerging markets and will also cover the legal instruments used to cover political risk in such emerging markets. The orientation of the module will be strongly towards students intending to practise in this field. The module will be taught in the second semester after you have obtained a grounding in International Finance 1.

  Taxation is a key factor in business decisions, and how to raise tax from businesses without damaging the economy is a central element in all government&rsquo;s policy.
In this module we will examine the taxation of businesses under UK income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. We will also consider, to a lesser extent, VAT, the UK interaction with foreign taxes, and stamp duty.
Although it is based around the UK tax system, the module deals with questions about the taxation of businesses that face all tax systems. Its object is to provide a solid grounding in the principles of the taxation of businesses, and the main rules will be studied in depth in the context of those principles.

  This module is set against the background of the internationalisation of the flow of goods, services and capital. It studies the private law response to this development and the emergence of trans-national commercial and financial law as a new lex mercatoria to support these flows. In this context, the creation of a new legal order is discussed and the spontaneous development of an independent international normativity in it, the sources of law that become relevant in this connection and the hierarchy amongst them.
The function and approaches of official or unofficial international bodies in the formulation of industry practices, like the ICC in the Incoterms and UCP, of Unidroit and Uncitral in the formulation of uniform law like for the international sale of goods and receivable financing, or of groups of academics in the formulation of principles, like those of contract and trust law, will also be discussed. Their findings will be compared with those adopted in the US, especially in the Uniform Commercial Code.
At the academic level, this module will study the operation of the major legal systems, especially those of Common and Civil Law. At the practical level, it will consider the details especially of the modern laws of contract, sales, agency, payments, personal property, trusts, secured transactions, conditional sales, financial leases, repurchase agreements, factoring, securitizations and financial derivatives including swaps.

  In a world which is dominated by global trading and free movement of capital and investment it is very likely that insolvency proceedings will not be hermetically contained in a single jurisdiction. Large multinational companies will often conduct business via a multitude of subsidiaries and branches in a number of different jurisdictions worldwide. Thousands of shareholders and debt investors may be scattered around the world. Even small and medium sized companies may have had dealings with parties from other countries, or may own or have interests in property which is located in different jurisdictions. Liabilities may be owed to parties domiciled in a different country from that of the debtor; or the relevant obligations may be governed by foreign law; or may be due to be performed abroad. These situations give rise to complex issues in respect of conflict-of-laws as well as the substantive law of insolvency and reorganisation.
The module is set against this background. In the first part of the module important issues of substantive corporate insolvency law will be analysed on a functional and comparative basis, taking into account the laws of major Western economies (US, UK, Germany, France). Over the last decade the three European jurisdictions under consideration have substantially reformed their insolvency laws (Germany in 1999, UK in 2002, France in 2005 and again in 2008/09). Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code has in many respects influenced these reforms and facilitated the rise of the rescue culture in Europe. Accordingly, particular emphasis will be put on the law of corporate reorganisation inside as well as outside formal proceedings (workouts). Despite this remarkable trans-Atlantic convergence, substantial differences remain, not least resulting from the interaction of corporate insolvency law with other areas of law such as company law, contract law and property law. We will trace these differences and try to explain them in the light of their social and economic contexts.
In the second part, the module will focus on the national and international instruments dealing with the conflict-of-laws issues in transnational corporate insolvency and reorganisation: the European Insolvency Regulation, the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, it implementation in the UK and the US, as well as Domestic Jurisdiction in the United States. The issues of jurisdiction, recognition of foreign proceedings, judicial cooperation in concurrent proceedings and the applicable law pursuant to these instruments will be studied, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective.

  With the globalization of corporate activity, capital movement and foreign direct investment, corporate governance has become a border-crossing concern and a contested field of debate on a global scale. At the same time, corporate governance rules and principles are increasingly being created and disseminated through a complex mixture of public, private, state and non-state based norm-making processes that involve different domestic, international and transnational actors. This module will study this fast-evolving regulatory landscape and provide students with a deeper understanding not only of the rules themselves but of the transnational political and economic conditions under which they are developing.
In the first part, the module will address different concepts of the corporation and of corporate governance from both a contemporary and historical perspective. The second part of the module will provide for a series of detailed studies of pressing issues in corporate governance regulation today by looking at both the 'hard' and the 'soft' law in these areas, including takeovers, hedge funds governance, rating agencies and corporate board composition.
The module exposes students to a variety of domestic, comparative and transnational bodies of law and norms and to a selection of cross-disciplinary debates that address the changing roles of corporate actors in a globalizing world. It is suitable for students interested in the transnationalization of corporate governance from both a practice perspective and a focus on the wider debates surrounding this lively regulatory field today.

  The premise of this module is that world trade law, as a specific sector of international economic law, is developing so rapidly and is increasingly occupying such a central role in international law that it merits separate treatment in a full LLM subject. The study of the subject will focus on the law of the World Trade Organization, within several contexts: political, economic, other instruments and rules of international law-making, and jurisprudential. As such, the study of world trade law will be a lens through which the role and position of law in the evolution of globalisation can be looked at and analysed. By learning to use that lens you will at once acquire practical legal knowledge and a firm conceptual framework of analysis.
The module looks at the various areas of WTO law, including institutions, dispute settlement, essential GATT principles, the TBT and SPS Agreements, trade protection, trade in services, intellectual property protection, treatment of developing countries, and constitutional issues such as the relationship with other international law and with domestic law.
