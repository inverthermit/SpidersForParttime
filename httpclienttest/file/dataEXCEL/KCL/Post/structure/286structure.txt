  This is an introductory module which provides an overview of drug delivery and drug disposition, ie drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and elementary pharmacokinetics, providing essential background knowledge for the pharmaceutical scientist. 
On completion of the module the student should have: An understanding of the significance of physicochemical properties in drug delivery and drug disposition; an appreciation of the approaches for delivering drugs to the body and the associated dosage forms; an understanding of the methods for evaluation of drug release from tablets, capsules and inhalers; an understanding of the structure of biological membranes and the various mechanisms associated with drug transport across them; an appreciation of the potential sites, reactions and factors which influence drug metabolism; an appreciation of the significance of drug metabolism in relation to biological activity; an understanding of the principles of pharmacokinetics and  an ability  to define and calculate the commonly used pharmacokinetic parameters.
  
    Research Project/dissertation - Pharmaceutical Sciences - Required

  Students on all three Masters Degree Programmes in the Pharmaceutical Sciences (Drug Metabolism   Toxicology, Pharmaceutical Analysis   Quality Control, Pharmaceutical Technology) are required to carry out a research project. The aim of the  research project  is  to provide students with the opportunity to study a particular topic in depth, give practical experience of research methodologies and in the presentation of scientific data, both orally and as a written report. 
 The Department of Pharmacy at King's is research active and as a result, Masters candidates are offered a considerable choice of research topics from across the entire spectrum of the pharmaceutical sciences, including:
Computational methods with applications in the pharmaceutical sciences
Drug delivery   formulation science
Drug metabolism
Toxicology
Pharmaceutical analysis
Isolation, identification and biological evaluation of materials derived from natural sources

The selection and allocation of research projects is carried out in November, and students are required to select three possible topics from a list of usually over sixty available, the final allocation being made by the Programme Directors. Obviously the projects selected must be appropriate for the degree programme being undertaken. 
 Project work starts in the second semester and students are expected to spend the equivalent of two days a week working on their projects. Following the summer examinations (these are generally held in May/June), work on the projects is carried out full time, and the final report is submitted for assessment in mid-August. 
 Students undertaking the degree programmes part-time are normally expected to carry out a practical-based project at their place of work, and they frequently have ideas for areas of investigation which would be of interest to their employers. However, depending on the nature of their employment it is appreciated that this may not be possible for everyone. In such instances these individuals are permitted to submit a critical survey of the literature (dissertation) rather than a practical-based research project. 
 Research projects/dissertations are assessed on the basis of the final written report (90 per cent) and a short oral presentation (10 per cent) at the end of the second semester.
