Description
The Dissertation is a core requirement for the MA, and represents one third of the assessment overall. It is therefore an important element of the MA programme, since it provides the opportunity to demonstrate specialised understanding and engagement with associated scholarly debates, and exercise independent critical judgment. This makes the Dissertation a major project, which demands considerable time, effort and organisational ability, but which also provides you with an opportunity to explore an aspect of war in the modern world that particularly interests you.
Researching and writing a Dissertation is one of the most challenging and rewarding tasks you will face as an MA student. In contrast with the mode of study in the taught modules, it is your responsibility to identify a viable topic; conduct the necessary research; and produce a sustained and coherent argument within a limit of 15,000 words.
The Dissertation preparation module will equip you with the knowledge and skills to undertake this work. We first consider what is involved in the planning and design of a research project. We then move on to study the particular strengths and weaknesses of the range of research methods available, provide guidance on conducting bibliographic searches and compiling a literature review, and discuss the wide variety of online and print resources. Finally, you are asked to put together an outline and preliminary bibliography for your Dissertation, which will be approved by your tutor, and assign you a supervisor before you embark on your research and writing.
A key element in this part of the MA programme is ensuring that your Dissertation project is viable, and this aspect will form a major part of your supervisor's assessment of the suitability of your outline. A viable topic is one that can be addressed within the resources available. You will be given further guidance on this when you embark on the Dissertation Preparation module.
Dissertations must be written by the student, without unacknowledged quotation or close paraphrasing of the work of other authors. Additionally, a dissertation may be original in that it makes a fresh contribution to knowledge or presents a wholly novel interpretation or argument: MA dissertations often meet this high standard of originality, but it is not a requirement that they do so.
The manner in which your Dissertation is presented, and the diligence with which it has been prepared and illustrated, are considered integral to its quality and will be reflected in marking. Typing errors, spelling mistakes, inaccurate calculation, poor grammar and convoluted syntax are frowned upon. On the contrary, effective written expression is a core criterion for assessment.
Please note: the Dissertation Preparation module, as a self-study module, will be available to you in KEATS from the beginning of your studies at the start of the year of entry. You can access the materials at any time. Familiarity with the processes involved is a good beginning. Although your dissertation may seem a long way off, it is worthwhile giving some thought as early as possible to a topic that must interest you sufficiently to write 15,000 words on it.
You will have access to the Dissertation Preparation discussions with your tutor until Term 3 of your second year of study. At this point, you will be guided through the module by a WSO tutor, who will provide advice and assist you with locating a supervisor. Note that the taught Dissertation Preparation module runs concurrently with your last WSO option module.

Description
This module examines the development of contemporary warfare during the period from the end of World War II to the early 1970s. It is a key component of the overall programme and provides the foundation for the more detailed engagement with issues and concepts relating to the conduct of war in the modern world that follows in the later modules. As well as gaining knowledge and understanding of the key events of the early Cold War, students are encouraged to examine developments in strategic theory and crisis management. This is achieved by extensive use in the learning objects of archival material to demonstrate how vital issues of war and peace presented themselves to political leaders at times of crisis, and the difficult choices they faced.
Our main focus is the military and political impact of the global rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The module begins by examining the origins of the Cold War with the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and the division of Europe, culminating in the Berlin Blockade in 1948&ndash;49. The module then analyses the spread of the Cold War to Asia and the Middle East, with a particular focus on the Korean War and the 1956, 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars. The module also examines another key feature of the Cold War: the nuclear arms race. It follows the qualitative and quantitative nuclear arms race between the superpowers and considers the different strategies of nuclear war. As an example, the unit looks at the most dangerous nuclear confrontation of the Cold War, the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The module concludes with a detailed study of the Vietnam War.

Description
This module examines the development of contemporary warfare and changes in the global balance of power from the mid Cold War until the early 21st century. It is a key component of the overall programme and provides the foundation for the more detailed engagement with issues and concepts relating to the conduct of war in the modern world which follow in the later options modules. As well as knowledge and understanding of the key events of the years from 1975 to 2011, students will be encouraged to examine developments in strategic theory and the conduct of war.
An important focus of this module is the end game in the Cold War, as the United States finally overcame the Soviet Union and established itself as the dominant global power. The module starts off by assessing the Sino-Soviet Split, China&rsquo;s rapprochement with the United States and the abortive Soviet-American d&eacute;tente in 1970s. The module then examines Ronald Reagan's global offensive against the USSR in the 1980s with increased American support for anti-Marxist rebels in the Developing World. In particular, we analyse the Soviet war in Afghanistan and investigate why the Soviets failed to achieve their goals there. The following unit looks at the end of the Cold War, with Mikhail Gorbachev's disengagement from the Developing World, the revolutions in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet Union. We assess why the Cold War ended and why it ended with a Soviet defeat.
The second half of the module examines the configuration of world politics in the wake of the Cold War. We consider some of the key texts that influenced the immediate post-Cold War security debates: were we witnessing the start of an American led 'New World Order' or a return to international anarchy? As part of this discussion we study the main crises and conflicts of the 1990s, such as the first Gulf War, the wars in the former Yugoslavia, the failed United States' intervention in Somalia and the genocide in Rwanda. In the final unit we analyse the challenges to American power which arose in the first decade of the 21st century and the conflicts that they caused. These challenges came from Islamist terrorism, with the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but also from the revival of Russia and the rise of China.

Africa and International Security
  
Description
This module allows for more specialized study of security in Africa than is possible in the core modules. It focuses more closely on the internal dynamics of particular conflicts, as well as the role of external actors. Key issues that have brought Africa to the focus of international attention include the autocratic tendencies of some leaders, economic mismanagementin particular the corruption of elites with regard to the exploitation of natural resourcesand the weakness of state institutions, notably those charged with the management of security.
Given Africa's diversity, we must be wary of making generalizations but some common themes and experiences do link many African countries. These include: the legacy of colonialism; the nature of post-colonial regimes; super-power competition during the Cold War; and internal struggles for the control of valuable natural resources. In this module, we take a closer look at these themes together with post-Cold War security challenges of state failure, poverty, disease, ethnic conflict and external intervention as they affect specific countries or regions in Africa. We also consider the ways in which the continent is trying to use the experiences of the past to address the challenges of the present and expectations about its future.

Air Power and Ethics
  
Description
Since the advent of air power during World War I its advocates have argued that in many ways it changed strategy forever. Traditional beliefs that decisive battles determined the outcomes of conflicts gave way to new assertions that, by operating directly against the enemy's centres of governance or its population, air power could achieve strategic results without the need for costly and bloody battles. Throughout the twentieth century's seemingly endless wars, attempts to achieve results in this fashion had the nature, and sometimes the appearance, of experimentation. Strategists and campaign planners struck at different targets at different times with mixed results that have been difficult to assess and measure. Alongside those campaigns, and ordinarily gaining far less attention, "tactical" aviators attacked traditional military targets upon battlefields, believing that the destruction of enemy forces in victorious battles would still, as always, prove decisive. Unfolding in a broadly chronological fashion, with a much closer focus on theories and ideas than on events, this module will explore the relative strategic influence of both independent and integrated air campaigns through analysis of their aims, effects and ethics.

Description
Consistent with and building upon the theme of Air Power Studies 1:The Quest for a New Strategy, but fully self-contained and able to stand alone, this module assesses a range of historical case studies of campaigns in which air power ostensibly contributed significantly to joint battles. Through in-depth campaign analyses the module seeks to determine the degree to which so-called 'tactical' inputs to battle can produce 'strategic' outcomes. It also examines the complex and sometimes awkward relationship between air forces and surface forces. These issues are powerfully important in our era in which protracted wars between industrialised states have become less frequent and less likely than intra-state conflicts and insurgencies. The case studies include: the Eastern Front, the North African Campaign, the Arab-Israeli Wars, the Vietnam War, the Falklands War, the Gulf Wars and the War on Terror.

Approaches to Post-Soviet Conflict
New States, Civil Wars
The Secessionists
Russian Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency
Ukraine and the Future of Eurasian Security

Description
The conflict in Ukraine has brought into sharp relief an enduring set of security issues related to Russia and its fellow post-Soviet states. This course focuses on the most acute and destructive end of the security spectrum: the armed conflicts that have plagued &ndash; and continue to plague &ndash; the independent states of the former USSR. These include civil wars, insurgencies, terrorist campaigns, and even (supposedly unfashionable) inter-state warfare. While each conflict must be examined within its own context, a number of structural conditions are shared across the post-communist space, and all have far-reaching implications for future Eurasian security.
The module seeks to provide specialised knowledge and understanding with regard to four key questions:
What types of conflict have occurred in the former Soviet space, and what are some of their common features?
What are the drivers of such conflicts, and what might determine their future trajectories?
What is the relevance of these conflicts for broader Eurasian and international security?
How have different theoretical approaches within strategic studies and international relations attempted to explain and define post-Soviet conflicts?
We begin in unit 1 by defining our area of focus, and considering several different analytical approaches to the region. We revisit the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the reformulation of European security and East-West relationships, and examine the ways in which this epochal transformation facilitated conflict, and whether 'decolonisation' is an appropriate framework for viewing this process. Next, we consider the role of ethno-nationalism as a driver of fragmentation and conflict, and contrast it with a more political economy driven explanation (focused on resource competition, neopatrimonialism and organised crime). Finally, we examine the rise and role of Islamist movements in the region, and responses to them.
In unit 2, we focus on civil wars and their regional repercussions. We begin with an exploration of 'militia-based warfare', a type of war-fighting rooted in neopatrimonialism that characterised these conflicts (as well as others in the region). Then, we examine the series of conflicts in Georgia, from independence to the Russo-Georgian war of 2008. This conflict introduces many of the variables we discuss in the module (political instability, nationalism, secession, corruption) as well as several different types of conflict within one arena. Ongoing issues with respect to Russia's relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and Georgia's quest for European integration, are also considered. Next, we explore the little-known Tajik civil war (1992-1997), which features an interesting mix of conflict types (civil war, refugee-based insurgency, Islamist terrorism) and external interventions (Russia, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan). We conclude by considering the current state of Central Asian security given domestic challenges and developments in Afghanistan. A major aim of this unit is to enable students to better interpret ongoing events in the Caucasus and Central Asia, two regions expected to experience greater instability in the coming years.
In unit 3, we focus on a series of secessionist conflicts that began in the late communist era, and remain unresolved to this day. We begin by considering the literature on 'frozen conflict' and interrogating its validity as a concept &ndash; and as a strategy. We then focus on the conflicts over Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria in the 1990s, and discuss possible future trajectories given more recent developments. Next we consider the first Chechen War (1994-1996) and other secessionist movements within Russia itself. This unit thus further elaborates the discussion of ethno-nationalism, intrastate conflict, borders and sovereignty, as well as the question of Russia's future as a unitary state.
In unit 4, we take a close look at Russian counterinsurgency and counterterrorism efforts. First, we set the stage by considering historical Russian and Soviet experiences with insurgency and terrorism, including the 19th-century anarchists, the Basmachi rebellions and the Soviet-Afghan war. This locates more recent efforts within a specific tradition and context. The unit focuses heavily on the second Chechen War (1999 to 2009), the domestic campaign of Chechen terrorism, and Russia's stance within the post-2001 global war on terror. We compare Russian and Western narratives on terrorism, and consider the question of whether (as often assumed) Russia is more successful than the West when it comes to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism?
Finally, in Unit 5 we focus on recent events in Ukraine and the current state of Eurasian security relations. First, we return to the context laid out in Unit 1 with respect to East-West relations and the remaking of Europe following the collapse of communism. Against this background, we deconstruct competing Western and Russian narratives with respect to the origins of the Ukraine conflict. We discuss the outbreak of the conflict and the annexation of Crimea, and then ground these events within theories of international relations and international security, considering realist, liberal and constructivist interpretations of the conflict. A key aim in this discussion is to explain why the Ukraine conflict has generated so much attention and debate in policy and academic circles, and provide space for comparing disparate narratives and interpretations. We discuss the implications of the conflict for NATO and European security relationships, as well as the broader spectrum of security challenges for Russia. Finally, we conclude the module by considering what the Ukraine conflict &ndash; as well as all the other conflicts we have examined &ndash; portends for the future of Eurasian security. While the module cannot keep up to the minute with ongoing events, its presentation of overarching historical, strategic and structural factors in this specific region should give students the tools better to understand and analyse ongoing developments after the conclusion of the module.

Complex Irregular Warfare
Global Insurgency
  
Description
This module is about forms of conflict known as insurgency, acts of rebellion against constituted political authorities. There are many ways of challenging the political order through violent and non-violent means, and the subject of insurgency is consequently a broad one. For many years, it has suffered relative professional and academic neglect, perhaps because it is so complex and perhaps also because it generates much confusion and debate. Ultimately, it refuses to be straitjacketed into the rubric of &lsquo;regular&rsquo; war, a situation compounded by a series of recent conflicts that throw into question strategic assumptions about contemporary and future warfare.
This module takes an evolutionary approach to the study of insurgency. Insurgency can be traced back millennia as a means of mobilising collective action by the population against an established administrative authority or state, but we focus in this module on the more recent history of insurgency and counterinsurgency (COIN).
Unit 1, 'Before Mao', looks at the roots of insurgency in order to outline its enduring principles and features. We look in particular at the legacy of one of the more romantic insurgent figures, Lawrence of Arabia, who wrote a treatise on The Science of Guerrilla Warfare. We will also examine the defining tactical method of the insurgent &ndash; propaganda of the deed &ndash; before moving on to consider pre-Maoist counterinsurgency, focusing primarily on British practice and theory.
Unit 2, 'Maoist and After,' begins with the 1949 victory of Mao's revolution in China and describes the essential characteristics of Maoist insurgency, the insurgent archetype for many decades after. We explore the counterinsurgency doctrines that emerged in response to it, with a particular focus on Galula and Kitson. We will also consider the varying approaches of France in Indochina, Britain in Malaya and the United States in Vietnam, in order to understand the respective outcomes in these campaigns.
Unit 3, 'Transition', explores the evolution of the Maoist prototype of insurgency to a form more reflective of the increasingly urbanised and international post-WWII world. A major focus is on how two insurgent groups in particular, the IRA and the PLO, harnessed the international media to achieve their strategic aims. We will also look at the phenomenon of failing states and its impact on insurgency thinking, and discuss the characteristics of the so-called 'new wars' and other ways of understanding insurgent violence after the end of the Cold War.
Unit 4, &lsquo;Complex Irregular Warfare&rsquo;, focuses on expeditionary COIN in the early 21st century and how COIN theory and practice have been applied, misapplied and argued over. We also explore what the implications of these debates are for force posture and structure, and for national strategy and international security, in the years to come. We will look at the case studies of counterinsurgency in Afghanistan and Iraq and assess how American and British COIN doctrine and practice fared in these expeditionary conflicts.
Unit 5, &lsquo;Global Insurgency&rsquo;, assesses evolutionary theories proposing a new mode of political violence, the &lsquo;global insurgency&rsquo;, epitomised thus far by al-Qaeda since 9/11. We look at insurgency as a globalised form of political violence, enabled by networked flows of people, resources and ideas in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. We ask whether there is a new &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; dimension of political violence and how we might revise the concept of propaganda of the deed as a key strategic factor in global insurgencies fought not only on physical battlefields but in the hearts and minds of diverse and globalised populations.

Understanding Intelligence
Evolution and Organization of Intelligence
The Intelligence Analyst and Policy Maker
Intelligence and War
Intelligence and Counter-insurgency
  
Description
Intelligence in War and Peace explores the complexities and difficulties of using intelligence in war and outside war. It is not explicitly a history of intelligence use, but rather incorporates study of various intelligence theories, as well as how intelligence failures occur and how they might be avoided. It deals with practical issues of intelligence analysis, explores intelligence organisation in the Western world over the last 60 years, and examines how the use of intelligence in conventional and unconventional warfare has changed in this period. The module explores a range of themes, from cognitive dissonance and other practical problems of intelligence analysis, to the history of the evolution of intelligence organisation in Britain and the USA since 1945. It explores the use of intelligence in peacetime, including national security and counter-terrorism. The use of intelligence in war is also explored in a thematic fashion. Intelligence has been and will continue to be an important force-multiplier in conventional warfare, and new technology is increasing its value. However, in counterinsurgency, high-tech means of intelligence collection is partnered with more conventional approaches, focusing on the attainment of cultural, social and demographic intelligence.

Law and war in the post-9/11 world
  
Description
International law is at the forefront of political, academic and public discourse about the use of force. This was increasingly evident in the decade following the end of the Cold War, when the Security Council acted with renewed vigour in situations they deemed to constitute a threat to international peace and security, including the 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and subsequent Gulf War, and interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and elsewhere. Legal arguments featured increasingly prominently, in debates about whether the international community was in breach of its obligation to intervene to stop the genocide in Rwanda, and, conversely, whether NATO&rsquo;s action against Serbia over Kosovo in the absence of explicit UNSC authorisation overstepped the boundaries of the law. More recently, it has been evident in discussions about the United States and its allies response to the threat of global terrorism, the invocation of self-defence as justification for the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, debates over the conduct of military operations, including allegations of misconduct, and criticism of the treatment of detainees, and new technologies on the battlefield, such as unmanned systems (drones) pose challenges to existing law, as does the potential displacement of the battlefield to cyberspace. Meanwhile, we have witnessed a halting, but seemingly irreversible trend toward a norm of accountability when the law is breached, exercised in domestic and international courts, and concerning the responsibility of individuals and that of the state. Discussions of legality feature ever more prominently in public discourse on the use of force, with allegations of war crimes levelled against political leaders on all sides. All of this has given rise to a need for a more systematic and thorough understanding of the relevant legal and ethical restraints on the use of force. This course is designed to provide a framework in which to discuss these important issues.
The course begins by considering the evolution of ethical and legal restraints on the use of force, culminating in the prohibition on the use of force enshrined in the United Nations Charter in all but exceptional circumstances. Units 2, 3 and 4 consider the scope of these exceptions in detail. Drawing on legal texts, academic debates and case studies, in unit 2 we consider the meaning and application of collective security under Article 42 of the UN Charter, the evolution of peacekeeping from its inception to the large footprint peacebuilding missions of the late-1990s and the legal framework for the regulation of peace operations devolved to regional actors. In unit 3, we consider the evolution of the Responsibility to Protect and its application in Kosovo, Darfur, Iraq, Libya and beyond. In unit 4, we consider the scope and application of the right of self-defence, from traditional understandings and interpretations of Article 51 of the UN Charter to its application in a contemporary world faced with new and old threats of nuclear weapons proliferation, acts of terrorism and cyber-war. Finally, in unit 5, we consider the scope and application of international law governing the use of force in the post-911 world and consider key challenges posed by the character and conduct of contemporary war.

The Nature of seapower

Seapower in the contemporary world
  
Description
Sea power explores a variety of aspects relating to the development and employment of naval forces in relation to war in the modern world. The approach encompasses elements of naval strategic thinking, naval history and an overview of contemporary naval operations to provide a broad understanding of the interaction between sea power and nations' wider strategic interests. The module begins by highlighting the complexities of defining what sea power is and how differing approaches to the employment of naval force have evolved over the past century. The components of sea power are outlined, as is the relationship between technological innovation and the evolution of naval power.
It further explores the concepts surrounding securing command of the sea and conversely denying its use by opponents. Unlike land warfare the purpose of naval force is not to take and hold ground, but rather to protect maritime communications and influence events ashore. In this role naval power projection and expeditionary warfare are examined. In addition to the wartime activities of naval forces the considerable array of peacetime duties, ranging from diplomatic tools and confidence building measures, constabulary and humanitarian operations are explored. Historic case studies are employed to outline timeless principles and key moments in the evolution of modern sea power. These are balanced by contemporary examples, like anti-piracy operations or the current maritime build-up in the Asia-Pacific region to illustrate the continued importance of sea power in the contemporary world.

Description
Some of the most important events in world history since 1945 have taken place in South Asia. At the beginning of the 21st century the region is a centre of both profound economic importance with the rise of India, but also a locus of global conflict in the context of the War on Terror, especially with military operations in Afghanistan. Historically, Afghanistan has been an important part of the strategic and security atlas of South Asia and as such is included in this module. The region is also the site of potential major war between two nuclear powers. This module will provide students an opportunity to study the region in depth, adding to knowledge gained in the core courses. The first part of the course will set the scene by examining the imperialist history of the region, and particularly the form and impact of decolonisation which set the stage of the Indo-Pakistan Wars, as well as the importance of the Kashmir region as a source of conflict. The next part of the course will look at the interaction of the region with two key external strategic players: the United States and China. Finally it will address the development of nuclear weapons in the region and its impact on the security dynamic therein.
