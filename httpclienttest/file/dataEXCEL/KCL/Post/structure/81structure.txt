  NB This module is the core module for the MA in Conflict Resolution in Divided Societies, and is available only to students on that programme.
This course, by way of an interdisciplinary approach and in support of more detailed case study analysis on optional modules, aims to introduce the student to the theory of ethnic-conflict regulation, engage with different scholarly debates and methodological approaches, and apply them to contemporary practice. It examines how national, religious and ethnic conflicts have been viewed and addressed in the contemporary world. A special emphasis will be laid on the historical nation state building failures that are at the heart of many of today&rsquo;s contested pluri-national disputes, with particular focus on the applicability of theories of conflict regulation to a wide range of cases.

  The aim of this module is to provide an in-depth historical analysis of the origin and development of the Arab-Israeli conflict from its onset in the early 20th century to the present day.
More specifically, it provides an introduction to the primary literature and the historiographical debate surrounding the creation of the State of Israel, the collapse and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society, and the ongoing conflict between Arabs and Jews over the Holy Land.
The course begins with a broad survey of Jewish and Arab/Muslim history in Palestine in general, and since the late 19th century in particular. It then looks at the impact of the British mandate on Arab-Jewish relations and its culmination in the establishment of the State of Israel and the collapse and dispersal of Palestinian Arab society, before proceeding to explore the successive Arab attempts to reverse the consequences of the 1948 war, or the Naqba (the catastrophe) as it is known in Arab parlance, against the backdrop of regional and global developments. Finally the course discusses the various peace initiatives over the past six decades and assesses the chances of attaining this cherished goal.

Using comparative analysis, this course enables you to evaluate the origins of political Islam and its impact on the contemporary Middle East. It will familiarise you with the scholarly theoretical debates over the rise of militant Islam and Western responses to the phenomena of international jihadism.
