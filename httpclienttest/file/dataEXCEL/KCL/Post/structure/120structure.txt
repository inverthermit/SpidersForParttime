  The aim of this course is to learn by individual experience through theoretical and practical work to achieve a specific objective within a fixed time independently; to combine the learned academic knowledge and to effectively use this knowledge for the work to be carried out in design, experiment, modelling and analysis; to develop skills in project planning and management; and to be trained in the skills of a practising engineer and a scientist.
Specific objectives are determined and recorded in the project plan after discussion with the Supervisor.
Syllabus
A project is normally selected in the first semester.
A 'project plan' should be agreed with the supervisor and discussed with the second marker. This should be prepared by the student by the first two weeks of the second semester and presented on an A4 page, submitting the aims and objectives of the project and a brief outline of the work programme.
The student will submit a project report, give an oral presentation and attend an oral examination.
