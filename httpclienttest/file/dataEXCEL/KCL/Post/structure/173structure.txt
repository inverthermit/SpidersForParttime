  Latin for Graduates aims to provide students with the translation skills necessary to carry out research for an MA dissertation or PhD thesis in late antique, medieval, or early modern studies. The module consists of intensive instruction in Latin grammar, from the basics to complex sentence structures involving a range of clauses, indirect speech, participles, etc. Students will also read a variety of texts in order to achieve an understanding of the particular features of post-classical Latin. The module is divided into beginning and advanced sections: the beginning section presumes no previous knowledge of Latin, while those students who have studied Latin to GCSE level or above are welcome to enter the advanced section.

  This module introduces students both to the wide range of legal materials surviving from the early fourth century to the Carolingian Empire, and to the wide range of historical issues that they raise. Late Antiquity was a hugely formative period in the history of Roman law, and also dictated the nature of at least some of the formal legal texts (the so-called Barbarian Codes') produced in early medieval, post-Roman, Europe. Equally important, the period between c.300 and c.900 AD saw slow but steady progress towards the emergence of the Christian Church as an institutional entity. Part and parcel of this process was the generation of a body of rules and regulations - Canon Law &ndash; with the same individuals often implicated in the making of both secular and ecclesiastical law. The module investigates not only the formal codes produced between the fall of Rome and the Carolingians, but also takes full account of the mass and range of less formal legal materials produced in the period, such as charters, wills, and books of formulae. Between them, this range of texts provides a large percentage of all the source material to survive from the early medieval west. 
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/chs/modules/level7/7AAH1011.aspx

 Students will read widely and extensively in the surviving legal sources, the vast majority of which are available in modern English translations. The focus of the module is as much social history as legal history. Why did kings and emperors publish law codes, and how were they used in practice? What degree of overlap existed between formal written law, and practical dispute settlement?

  This module begins by examining the causes of Magna Carta. It then looks beyond 1215 to consider both the achievements of the Charter and its defects, defects that meant that by 1258/9 far more radical schemes of political reform were imposed on the king. Central to the module will be a detailed analysis of the Charter of 1215, the later versions of 1216, 1217 and 1225, and the reforms of 1258 and 1259. The module will thus provide students with a comprehensive grasp of the issues in dispute between the king and his subjects in the central Middle Ages, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the constitutional means by which attempts were made to bring those disputes to resolution.

      In the first term, students will complete an essay (worth 25%).
In the second term, they will be required to edit a section of text (worth 75%). Translation and commentary will show linguistic competence.
     
  The course is in two parts. The first term is exploratory: students will read selected texts from the whole medieval period - from late antiquity to the high Middle Ages - in a variety of genres (theology, poetry, history, law, etc.) In the second term the class will learn how to edit a medieval Latin text. The text chosen will be one which (i) has not been published, or critically edited, before; (ii) exists in at least one accessible MS(S) for first-hand collation (i.e. BL or Lambeth; other witnesses may be supplied in microfilm or located online); (iii) is of interest to the current takers of the course.
In the first part of the course students will be expected to prepare texts for each week and to write a short essay on a medieval Latin source or sources. In the second term each student will be given a section of the text to edit with critical apparatus, translation, and commentary on all aspects.

  This module will consider the history of slavery and unfreedom from the late Roman empire down to the Renaissance. The middle ages saw the disappearance of European slavery in the Roman mould, in which a restricted number of persons were under the complete legal and material control of their master, and its replacement with serfdom, a lighter form of subjection, but one which involved the majority of the rural population. Alongside these local developments, the slave trade, both in Northern Europe and in the Mediterranean, remained buoyant, and apparently subjected to fundamentally different rhythms of evolution. This course will be unique in offering students the opportunity to study this important topic throughout the medieval period, from late antiquity and the fall of the Roman empire through to the late medieval slave trade, in Western Europe as well as in Byzantine and Islamic regions. 
 The module will consider a variety of themes, such as enslavement, captivity and conquest; ways in and ways out of slavery; the slave trade; gender and sexual exploitation; the ability or inability of slaves to form families; slaves as the &lsquo;other&rsquo;; the scope for social mobility as well as exclusion; and the concept of social crisis, often linked with the subjection of the free by both contemporary writers and modern historians. The course will also consider slavery in the context of wider social change, since it cannot be assumed that the free-unfree divide, much insisted on by Roman masters and medieval lords after them, would always have been the most crucial form of social differentiation (the free poor, among others, constitute an important point of comparison). The available sources vary widely according to time and place: they include the writings of philosophers and moralists, letters, inscriptions, agricultural handbooks, laws, Christian polemic, saints&rsquo; lives, poetry, penitentials, archive documents and estate-surveys.

  The course is broken into three unequal parts, which, between them, will enable you think about more or less a thousand years of Christianity from c.300 to 1300 AD. The focus throughout will be on the tensions between various versions, in different eras, of what exactly constituted &lsquo;True&rsquo; Christianity, both in terms of doctrine and in competing views of &lsquo;proper&rsquo; ecclesiastical and especially lay piety. The course begins with three weeks devoted to the late Antique period, where some of the key building blocks of medieval Christianity were laid in place, followed by two sessions on developing patterns of Christianity in the early medieval west. After reading week, we will then spend five weeks looking at some key aspects of Christian development in the High Middle Ages. Examination will be a 4000 word essay on a relevant topic of your choice developed with guidance from the module coordinator.

  How, why, where and when 'feudal' society came into being has long been a concern of medieval historians. During the 1950s, Georges Duby, a prominent historian working in France, came up with a totalising argument explaining how all the elements we associate with the medieval period - chivalry, knighthood, homage, fealty, the fief as the unit of property, aristocratic lineages - were caused and unleashed by a radical transformation in the way in which power was exercised around the year 1000. For Duby, the old public order of the Carolingian Empire suddenly and irreversibly disintegrated, leaving in its stead a private order of lordly power, closed family units, and a larger aristocratic class. Power was no longer exercised by the public order of the state but by the private order of lords. Because of their wide explanatory power, Duby's view found great favour among historians working within and outwith France for about thirty years. Since then, however, Duby's 'revolution' or mutation has become far more controversial. Fewer and fewer historians believe in the historical reality of such a transformation or revolution in the exercise of power over the year 1000 and even fewer believe that these political arguments explain the wide range of social and cultural phenomena that Duby posited. Even the concepts of 'feudalism' and 'feudal society' have become inherently problematic. Yet it is still extremely difficult understand historical change between the years 980 and 1200 without recourse to the explanation of feudal revolution. Understanding these debates, and what the problem is with feudalism, is thus key to any one wishing to research any social, legal or political phenomenon in medieval Europe. This module will thus be of interest to anyone wishing to do further research on lordship, medieval hierarchies and the exercise of power, and who wishes their work to span the great divide between the early and the central Middle Ages.
You do not need to have a reading knowledge of foreign languages but French would help.

  During the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, there was a gigantic expansion in the records produced by royal government in England, an expansion itself reflecting a revolution in the workings of that government. Many of these records survive in The National Archives at Kew. They provide a resource for historians unparalleled in the rest of Europe. The aim of this course is to understand these records, and through them understand the development and workings of government and its increasing impact on society. The course will also show how the records can open windows onto the politics, economy and wider culture of the period. The course will thus engage closely with the records of the chancery, and its fine, charter, patent, close, and liberate rolls. It will do likewise with the records of the exchequer (the pipe, memoranda and receipt and issue rolls) and the law courts (the plea rolls of the king&rsquo;s justices in the localities and at Westminster). The course will provide a grasp of both the burdens of government (through its financial exactions) and its benefits (through the developing procedures of the early common law). There will also be a session on the development of parliament. Students taking this course will be well for using the records in their doctoral research.

It examines the varieties of women&rsquo;s position in law, and of women&rsquo;s economic activities in town and countryside and at different social levels. Special attention will be given to the role of gender in the work of women writers from Dhuoda to Christine de Pizan and, in social and political history at large, to the interplay of gender and class.

  This module will focus on the development of Latin and vernacular writing in England in a particularly formative period. The centuries between the conversion to Christianity and the Norman Conquest saw the development of new written language &ndash; English &ndash; and experimentation with a range of novel types of writing, each produced to meet contemporary needs in an environment in which writing was not only exceptionally precious but carried particular social and political significance. The module will introduce students to techniques for dating and localizing manuscripts and will investigate circumstances in which writing was developed and practised. It will consider library books, new compositions and documents, and the development of new types of script to meet the demands of readers and patrons.

  This module offers a broad overview of texts and debates on fourteenth- and fifteenth-century politics and society, with a focus on Italian thinkers. An age of incessant political and institutional experiments, the centuries between Aquinas and Machiavelli shaped the political languages of modern Europe. We will analyse canonical and less canonical texts as voices in wider debates and contexts. The conflict between secular and religious power, the different ways in which the body politic was imagined, the subordination of women and the young in the family-state compact, the problem of legitimate and illegitimate political authority are some of the themes that will be explored. We will read the works of Dante, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Saxoferrato, Christine de Pizan, Leon Battista Alberti, Lorenzo Valla, Savonarola and others, together with everyday texts such as letters and memoirs.
