STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
     
  Core programme content
   Core modules (students with an appropriate degree and full SVT accreditation may be allowed exemption from the first two modules / PG Certificate modules):
Fundamentals of Ultrasound Practice (Core for PG Certificate)
Vascular Ultrasound (Core for PG Certificate)
Research Methodology (Core for PG Diploma   MSc)
Advanced Vascular Ultrasound (Core for PG Diploma   MSc)
Research Project (Core for MSc).

     
   Indicative non-core content
   There are no optional modules in this Vascular Ultrasound MSc. Students may exit with the 60 credit PG Certificate, the 120 credit PG Diploma or progress to the MSc. Students may study a specialist topic as an individually negotiated work-based module as part of the PG Certificate Ultrasound in Specialist Practice. Qualified sonographers may study the Vascular Ultrasound module as a stand-alone module.
     
   
   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  The programme is offered on a block release basis in conjunction with compulsory clinical placements. Coursework, practical assessment and written examinations assess the modules. Clinical competence is assessed by ongoing formative and summative assessments and an observational visit by a member of the programme team.

      The examination involves an OSCE where students answer questions on relevant images. Students must present cases and other material to their peers and write two essays. The clinical assessment  includes submission of a case log book.
     
  The aim of this module is to explore specialist areas of vascular ultrasound practice and critically examine health issues  in relation to vascular ultrasound in an innovative way. This will facilitate development of a critical reflective approach to vascular ultrasound practice  and promote an independent approach to learning in order to develop the student personally and professionally and to actively challenge, and critically evaluate current practice and evidence of best practice. Assessment is by coursework, assessed presentation and clinical assessment.

  This module will enhance students&rsquo; understanding of research and  equip them with the skills to evaluate the research of others.  Students will be taught how to use and interpret descriptive statistics and how to use statistical tests in relation to a given hypothesis. Students will acquire skills to construct a research proposal, and to carry out independent research or audit confidently
  
    Research Project - Required

   
      
  
    
      
     Module code:

      This is assessed by a written case study, a written examination, an OSCE and a clinical assessment.
     
  The aims of this module are:
To provide the student with an understanding of the use of ultrasound in vascular diagnosis.
To provide the student with an understanding of blood flow and pathology in vascular disorders.
To provide the student with an understanding of other non-invasive and invasive techniques for vascular diagnosis and an understanding of the relative merits and limitations of these techniques.
To produce, recognize, interpret and report on normal and abnormal ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound images for vascular diagnosis.
