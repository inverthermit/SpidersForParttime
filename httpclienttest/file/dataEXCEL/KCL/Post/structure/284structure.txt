  Over four days this module provides advanced training in the principles of clinical pharmacology essential to drug development. This includes practical and ethical issues associated with non-patient volunteer studies, the design of such studies and interpretation of the results. Completion of this module will enable you to take an active role in a multidisciplinary team to design and analyse clinical pharmacology studies.
Key topics include: Non-patient volunteer studies, planning a clinical development strategy, use of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic measures in clinical pharmacology studies.
You will take part in practical sessions to plan a clinical development strategy for a potential new medicine, prepare a study protocol, analyse study results and learn how to present clinical pharmacology study results through both verbal and written presentations.

  In this module, two of the most important issues within the drug development process and the whole of clinical research are addressed.
In addition to reviewing the general principles of medical ethics and how they apply to clinical research as defined within the various guidelines and statutes we will have presentations from patient groups and a member of an ethics committee. The issues around business ethics and marketing will also be explored.
We will look at the mechanisms of cellular toxicology, the value of spontaneous reporting and the use of large electronic data bases as means of evaluating the safety of medicines. We will look at safety issues from the point of view of the sponsor, the investigator and the regulator and learn how to develop and implement a risk management plan.

  Pharmacoeconomics is of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry as health care budgets become even more squeezed and purchasers are continuously looking at the costs of medicines as a place to start saving money. Thus, simply saying that a product is safe and effective is no longer enough and companies are increasingly having to justify their prices by showing the value-added benefit of a particular product in terms of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
This module is designed to give you the skills to understand a pharmacoeconomic evaluation, plan a pharmacoeconomic study, interpret the results of completed studies and critically appraise them, and assemble the information for a health technology appraisal.
The module is lead by Professor Julian Guest, Visiting Professor at King&rsquo;s College London. Professor Guest has conducted a large number of pharmacoeconomic studies in a broad range of therapeutic areas and many of them have been published.
  
    Preclinical Science - Optional

    
  
      
     Module code:  
7BBP0002

  This module covers three major areas:
The pharmacology part of the module will include basic principles, plus the use of animal models, including transgenic models. You will see how the pharmacology studies inform the choice of drug candidates.
You will learn of the importance of preclinical safety testing, including what tests are needed to start and progress a clinical development programme. You will learn how to look for critical information within a toxicology report and will visit a major toxicology laboratory. 
The module will also introduce aspects of pharmaceutical sciences, including the choice of formulation, stability testing, scale-up and how these issues can impact on a clinical trial programme.
