    Teaching pattern:  
Students will have 4 hours of class contact time each week. Sessions will include lecturing, teacher-led class discussions and student-led group work. Group discussions will focus on core readings in the field, and other practical, analytical tasks carried out in class time.

      1. 2 x language analysis tasks (1500 words each)
2. Coursework involving professional tasks that show the application of applied linguistic knowledge in language teaching (3000 words)
     
  This module focuses on the systems of English language, i.e. grammar, lexis, pronunciation and pragmatics. It introduces different frameworks and categories for analysing these components and provides opportunities to use these to analyse language use in spoken discourse and written texts. It examines the changes in English resulting from its role as a global language. In particular, this module provides opportunities to apply this knowledge to the teaching of English as a second or foreign language and to the evaluation and design of syllabuses, teaching materials and lesson plans.

  All students need to be able to meet the linguistic demands of a course of study and this need is critical if they are studying in a second or foreign language. This course focuses on the central problem of written communication in academic contexts, and gives participants an opportunity to develop an understanding of the language and teaching issues that are central to EAP programmes. The course draws on a range of important theoretical and descriptive frameworks in building an account of how best we can help EAP students in particular functional systemic linguistics, genre analysis, and corpus linguistics. It also give practical insights into how to use this understanding in preparing practical courses for students studying in English. Apart from this focus on teaching writing, this course gives students the chance to focus on important issues in EAP in particular: preparing for the IELTS test, study skills, needs analysis and the management of EAP courses.

  This module scrutinises the 'standard' principles and theories of language teaching against the backdrop of the socio-political context of ESOL/ESL in the UK, and other English dominant settings such as the USA, Canada and Australia. It places the teaching of migrants in the broader contexts of globalisation, 'superdiversity' and public policy, with particular reference to the backgrounds of adult migrants and ESOL/ESL teachers. We will explore some key social theories, eg theories of identity, Bourdieu's theory of capital, which have been applied to English language teaching and learning in English dominant settings.

  This module addresses a number of perspectives on the relationship between language and power. It sets up a dialogue between theories and methods from social theory, critical discourse analysis, interactional sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. It examines the dynamics of language and power in, for example, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, education, informal, institutional   mass-mediated discourse, and global and local interaction. The module also helps students to conduct their own analyses. By the end of this module, participants will have an understanding of relations of language and power in a wide range of domains and communicative settings, and an understanding of how relevant research approaches might be practically applied.

It aims to offer an up-to-date account of current developments and thinking in the field of language testing and assessment, with particular reference to English Language Teaching in different world locations. Discussions on theory and practice will be explicitly referenced to the two established paradigms in language assessment: psychometrically oriented language testing and classroom-based teacher language assessment.

  In the contemporary world, people are saying that language and discourse are now more important than ever before, and across the Humanities and Social Sciences, there has been a major &lsquo;discursive/linguistic turn&rsquo;. Instead of trying to identify the central, stable features that characterise different individuals, groups or &lsquo;cultures&rsquo;, researchers are now much more interested in trying to establish the ways in which language and discourse are used to construct cultural difference and social identity, both in face-to-face interaction and in public representations.
So this module looks at the debates about the role that language places in power, ideology, resistance and social change, and considers several major 20th century cultural theorists, such as Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault and Erving Goffman.

  Linguistic Politeness looks at different ways of conceptualizing politeness; from folk definitions and lay perceptions of what constitutes polite language and behaviour to politeness theories. It introduces you to pragmatic and discursive approaches to politeness, as well as having a strong practical component which will involve investigating how politeness can be best captured in everyday interaction and compared across groups. We will discuss different types of data and different methodologies and cover the full range of politeness phenomena, including impoliteness.

  This course will give participants a better idea of the role of materials within the ELT curriculum, and provide them with tools to investigate learners' needs, plan courses for ESP and General English classes, and analyse, design and adapt tasks and materials for their students. The course builds on work already done in all the previous courses, especially on task-based instruction and SLA, descriptions of English, curriculum design and pedagogy. Participants will have the opportunity to apply theory and principles from these earlier courses and put them to practical use. 
 This is a theory-informed practice oriented course and quite a large part of class time will be used for workshops where participants will work together in pairs and groups, evaluating, adapting and designing materials, and planning courses based on the needs of their students, with the help of the tutors. Some of the outputs from these workshops may be included in participants' assignments. Participants will be expected to find time between sessions to do further work on materials development tasks that they start in the workshop sessions, in addition to reading the key texts. It is also recommended that during the course participants spend some time looking carefully at published materials as a source of ideas on content, topics, task types, layout and design, methodology and syllabus. The assignment for this course can be in the form of a piece of professional work in materials design or materials evaluation, rather than a traditional academic essay.

Key concepts and issues in sociolinguists
The difficulty in defining &lsquo;standard&rsquo; English
The global spread of English
World Englishes, English as a Lingua Franca and implications for ELT
Pidgin and Creole language
Language, thought and culture
Gendered language
Politeness theory
The role of sociolinguistics in ELT

  This module will introduce students to the latest technologies and on-line learning environments used in language teaching. These will be presented in the context of theoretical discussions on their pedagogical value and in terms of their applicability to a range of learning contexts. Students will also be able to try these tools in hands on sessions. The assessment will give students the opportunity to design and develop their own lesson plan and/or materials applying pedagogical principles relevant to the digital classroom and using one or more of the on-line and digital technology tools introduced during the module.

  Professionals with an interest in genre analysis, discourse analysis, cultural studies, materials development, ESP course development, or the study of literature need to understand how to work with texts.
This module is designed for students who are interested in developing analytic skills which will enable them to engage with texts for use in language teaching, applied linguistics or literary research. Drawing on techniques drawn from corpus linguistics, students will learn how to make practical use of commercial and open sources text analysis programs in linguistic and social research, or materials development in language education.
Although written texts will be the major focus of the option module, students will also be able to use the the tools and techniques they have learned how to use in the analysis of spoken texts.
