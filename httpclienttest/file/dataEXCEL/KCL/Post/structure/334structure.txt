  This module provides an understanding of anthropological and sociological approaches to the study of religion in contemporary Western and non-Western societies. Students learn how to investigate religion empirically, through discussion of case studies as well as through formulating their own hypotheses, and designing, conducting and analysing surveys, interviews, and participant observation.

  This is an optional module for students studying MA programme Religion in Contemporary Society. It is designed to introduce theoretical perspectives and methodological tools to study the intersection between religion and politics in Western democracies. It complements the already existing anthropological and sociological modules on religion and society (7AATC822 and 7AATC823). The focus is on the role religion plays in different types of established &ldquo;secular&rdquo; democracies. It maximises students&rsquo; awareness of the way political actors and institutions assert power by either invoking or excluding religious discourses and practices in the public sphere. The module uses case studies to illustrate theoretical arguments.
