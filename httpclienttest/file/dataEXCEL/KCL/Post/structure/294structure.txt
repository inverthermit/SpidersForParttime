   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  From October to March you will study specialised taught material, attend lectures and seminars, carry out related assessed tasks, prepare an assessed research proposal, select your project topic and plan how your project will be performed. Lecture courses attended between October and March will be assessed by examination in May. Other assessments include a project plan and a patent draft. You will carry out your project full-time from April with a mid-project review and submission and oral presentation in September. Your project will contribute 50 per cent of the marks for your degree and you must also achieve at least 50 per cent in each module. The taught material is assessed by essays and exercises.
