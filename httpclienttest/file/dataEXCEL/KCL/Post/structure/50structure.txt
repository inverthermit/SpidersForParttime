  The module will teach students about the sustained and rich discussion of the theme of the beautiful in the Western Church, a discussion which runs through every century of its history and has often provoked fierce contention (as in the Reformation). It will introduce students to this tradition, tracing its debts to classical models of the relationsihp between beauty and goodness (especially in the works of Plotinus), through the medieval discussions of beauty as a transcendental (especially in the work of Aquinas), to the theological influence on philosophical aesthetics in the 18th and 19th centuries (including the observation of a distinctively British tradition in Coleridge, Ruskin, Hopkins and others). It will conclude with the major works in the area of theological aesthetics that have been produced since the 20th century (Jacques Maritain, David, Jones, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Davie Bentley Hart, Rowan Williams). The module will encourage students to judge the status of 'aesthetics' as a theological locus, and to relate the philosophical and theological discussions they encounter to actual works of art.

This module will look closely at the ways in which different Christian environments and needs have helped to foster particular kinds of art. This will require art-historical and church-historical input; a knowledge of the history of religious ideas and devotional practices, of the aspirations of patrons as well as of popular piety, and of how all these things shaped artistic commissions and objects.
This is one of two modules in the MA in Christianity and the Arts that relate principally to paintings in the National Gallery collection. The module is 20 taught hours, in 10 sessions during the Michaelmas Term 2010, and will be taught in the Gallery &ndash; one hour in a seminar room and one on the Gallery floor.

  Through seminars students will explore the ways in which key thinkers/literary texts have sought to make sense of, and come to terms with, the role of Christianity in a period of intense doubt and scepticism. Students will explore such matters largely in an ethical context. The module will be essentially structured around discussion based on the reading of the texts set. Students will have a chance to present material for discussion by the group.
Sample topics
Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s Crime and Punishment: Christianity, guilt, innocence and repentance.
T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s Four Quartets: Christianity &lsquo;under conditions/That seem unpropitious&rsquo;.
Gerard Manley Hopkins &lsquo;The Wreck of the Deutschland&rsquo; and other poems: Suffering and loss in God&rsquo;s grand and terrible world
James Joyce&rsquo;s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: Youth, guilt and loss of faith.
Graham Greene&rsquo;s The Heart of the Matter: Faith in a hostile environment: love, pity and sin.

NB Books studied may vary from year to year, and will be confirmed at the start of the term.

  In recent years, art and religion have frequently been cast as mortal enemies, with &lsquo;modern art&rsquo; playing the part of the villain, spitting&mdash;or worse in the case of Andres Serrano&rsquo;s Piss Christ (1987)&mdash;on the symbols and ideals of religion.
In this module we will avoid erecting simple binaries between modern art and religion, instead seeking to understand the ways in which each has opened up new understandings and trajectories for the other, sometimes by virtue of tension and controversy. As we progress from the 19th century to the present, we will sometimes encounter works with explicitly religious subject matter, as in Chagall&rsquo;s crucifixions or Warhol&rsquo;s images of the last supper. Often, however, we will identify less explicit ways in which religion has inspired modern artists, from Turner&rsquo;s attempts to evoke the sublime or the Abstract Expressionists&rsquo; interests in mythology and mysticism.
After examining artists&rsquo; personal commitments, we will conclude by looking at how modern artists have worked within institutional frameworks, creating such iconic spaces as the Rothko Chapel in Houston and the Matisse Chapel in Vence.
Throughout this module, we will make a special effort to take advantage of the unique resources of London&rsquo;s museums and religious spaces, from Tate Modern and Tate Britain, to such nearby churches as St. Stephen&rsquo;s Walbrook and St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The readings for this module will be consummately interdisciplinary, pairing the writings of artists and art historians with theologians and philosophers, including Kant, Merleau-Ponty, and Tillich.

  This module engages with a series of literary texts across historical periods from the perspective of both their theological content and contexts. It therefore offers an analytical, hermeneutical approach to both the history of theological literature (Augustine, Eckhart, Dante), and to theologically related literatures (H&ouml;lderlin, Paul Celan and Yves Bonnefoy), as well as to the hermeneutics of language use in specifically theological frameworks (Pauline texts). In this module we will further the study of both the implicit and explicit understandings of language, its possibilities and limitations, in different theological contexts and genres.
