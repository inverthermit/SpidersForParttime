   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  This Masters programme is assessed through a combination of assignments, written examinations, clinical case presentations and a dissertation. In the first two years, most modules within the programme are assessed by a combination of 60 per cent written examination and 40 per cent written assignments. 
Each year you will receive an assignment schedule to follow for the year and must complete two assignments from each module between January and August to be entered into the end of year exams. Exams can be taken in London or, for overseas students, at centres in the student's country of residence. 

Further details of overseas exam arrangements and applicable fees can be viewed at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/about/structure/admin/acservices/examinations/students/sea/alternative
The 
Clinical Practice module is undertaken over the three years of the programme and is assessed 100 per cent on a clinical portfolio of four cases. The Report module is undertaken in the final year. Students will work towards a 10,000 word dissertation/project with an allocated supervisor which will be assessed 100 per cent on the basis of the report.
