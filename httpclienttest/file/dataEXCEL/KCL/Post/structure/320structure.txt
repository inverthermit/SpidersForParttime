      This is an Introductory but compulsory module
     
  The aim of this module is to introduce students to a range of advanced statistical techniques frequently used in psychological research and to prepare them for a career involving psychological and psychiatric research. Specific topics include:
- Advanced multiple regression
- Effect modification
- Mediation, Reliability and Validity
- Explorative Factor analysis
- Survival analysis 
- Meta-analysis
The emphasis throughout the module is on combining a conceptual understanding of these forms of statistical analysis procedures with practical skill in using them to analyse data sets and presenting such analyses. Assessment of model assumptions and a critical assessment of the strengths and shortcomings of the various techniques will be an integral part of this module. The lectures will be written and presented by expert statisticians from the Department of Biostatistics of the Institute of Psychiatry, often using examples taken from their own experience.

      This is an Introductory but compulsory module.
     
  This module aims to prepare students for scientific research by providing the opportunity to learn how to transform their ideas for a scientific project into a published paper. The module will be a dynamic interplay between presentations, practical exercises and discussions to optimally prepare the student for scientific research. The module will include several lectures fitting in one of the following three categories:
1) Study design
2) Funding and 
3) Writing a paper. 
The first category will focus on how to structure an idea, recognise limitations (population, money, ethics) and the importance of this stage, design and conduct the actual study. The second topic will focus on acquiring funding: where does one find information on funding bodies, and how one writes a funding application. This will also include a session on how to best present yourself, including writing a CV. The third topic focuses on writing a paper: how to shape different sections, reference managers, how to sell your story, where to submit (open access or not), how to cope with rejection and how to resubmit. The lectures will be written and presented by expert scientists and clinicians from the Institute of Psychiatry, often using examples taken from their own experience.

Students will also be proficient in: univariate statistical analyses, and be able to interpret stratified analysis and linear regression; critical appraisal of research reports.
 Assessment is by two three-hour unseen written examinations, which each account for 50% of the final grade for this module. There is also a written assessment and critical appraisal at the end of the first term, which is mandatory but does not contribute to the final mark.

  This module will focus on the pharmacological impact of drugs on the brain in the context of psychiatric illness. Initial topics include an introduction to fundamental principles of pharmacology, an overview of synaptic transmission, receptor models and signal transduction cascades. This will be followed by lectures that will relate major psychiatric disorders to the corresponding malfunctioning brain circuits and discuss the rationale for the use of specific class of drugs in each psychiatric disorder. Detailed lectures on the classes of psychopharmacology drugs, their mechanism of action and side effects will follow. This module will also provide an overview of clinical scales used to measure psychopathology as a tool to measure treatment outcomes. Research methods employed in psychopharmacological research related to psychiatric illness will be highlighted during the talks. The lectures are designed to give students a fundamental understanding of how psychiatric drugs work in order to enable them to undertake psychiatric research.

  This module will focus on what is meant by translational research in the context of psychiatric illness. The lectures will cover the different steps in the process of translation of findings from basic or epidemiological research to treatments/ interventions available to the patient as well as the process of reverse translation. Students will also learn about the different stages of translational research and the potential blocks to effective translation as well as why translational research has become the buzzword in psychiatric research circles now more than ever before. Exemplars of ongoing translational work from different areas of psychiatric research will be presented by internationally acclaimed researchers to give an understanding of how translation of research onto practice happens in real life by giving a glimpse of research at various stages of the translation pathway as well as within different domains of psychiatric research. While the majority of the lectures will be from academicians, the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry will also be provided through guest speaker/s from the industry. Finally, an attempt will also be made to give an understanding of the funding landscape for translational research within the UK in particular and the critical importance of taking into account the perspective of service users and carers for truly effective translational research.
