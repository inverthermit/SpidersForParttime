  This course sets the mental health assessment in a broad context. It looks at it in terms of the mind/brain relation, the experience of mental illness, what it is to make a diagnosis and the &ldquo;biopsychosocial&rdquo; model of mental disorder. It examines aspects of psychiatry that have ethical and legal significance such as assessment of decision-making capacity, risk and treatment with and without patient participation. The course will equip students to identify concepts of psychiatry and understand why this branch of healthcare has particular ethical and legal significance.

Taught by: Professor Genevra Richardson

In the UK, as in many other jurisdictions, the law makes special provision for people with mental disorder. The principles underpinning the law relating to people with mental disorder are introduced and you consider the rationale and possible justification for this special legal provision. Concentration is on the law relating to non-offender patients and examines the relationship between mental health law and the law relating to those who lack capacity.

  This module is for students who wish to increase their knowledge of, as well as develop a critical understanding of, the complex moral issues arising in the context of disability. The notion of disability is one of the most contested in medical ethics. This module explores different conceptions of disability and how these differences affect both how we think about individuals with disability and public policy. Using the examples of autism and bi-polarity it will explore the idea of neurodiversity and cultural identity. It will also consider the moral problems raised by potential developments in enhancement technologies, particularly in the areas of cognitive improvements, sport and even morality.

Taught by: Professor Rosamund Scott

This module addresses the law relating to assisted reproduction and the embryo, primarily in England   Wales. You explore the law on assisted reproduction and surrogacy and consider legitimate uses of the embryo beyond the reproductive sphere, studying embryo research / stem cell research / therapeutic cloning. These themes are united by the fact that the latter activities may stem from the embryos created but not used in medically assisted reprodution. You also consider some key underlying ethical issues.

  Half-module

Taught by: Professor Penney Lewis

The question whether assisted dying should be legalised is often treated as one which transcends diverse legal systems. As a result, the important context in which individual jurisdictions make decisions about assisted dying and the significance of the legal methods chosen to carry out those decisions is often lost. You study the legal regulation of assisted dying in a wide range of jurisdictions, including those which permit some form(s) of assisted dying and those in which legalisation attempts has been unsuccessful.

  Below are the indicative topics that can be taken. Any two of the topics listed below can be selected for Topics in Medical Ethics I (20 credits); any two topics not already selected can be taken for Topics in Medical Ethics II (20 credits). These modules provide you with a knowledge and critical understanding of key topics in medical ethics.
Psychriatic Ethics
Psychiatric practitioners and other mental health professionals face a set of distinctive ethical questions that link into deep philosophical issues to do with the mind. This topic addresses a range of central issues in this area: how to define mental disorder, and corresponding issues concerning diagnosis and the relevance of neuroscience; ethical dilemmas concerning autonomy and mental disorder, particularly in relation to substituted decisions and advance directives; and the question of why mental disorder is taken to be relevant to moral and criminal responsibility.
Justice    the Allocation of Health Care Resources
In a situation of permanent scarcity of health care resources but with a National Health Service, many difficult moral problems arise about how the resources we have should be used. This module addresses these issues by examining what social justice requires and whether considerations of justice can give us a practical resolution of the problem of scarce resources. It looks at some of the decisions made by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and at the cost-benefit analysis behind its decision-making.  You will also consider some of the problems associated with other countries' approach to these issues.
Reproductive Ethics
This module covers the central issues in reproductive ethics by addressing a number of key topics such as abortion, and disability and in so doing it familiarises  you with the key ethical arguments in this context. The main theme concerns the scope of the moral interest in having or not having a child or children.
Reproduction    Genetics
This module covers the central ethical issues in genetic selection practices by addressing key topics in relation to selection by means of pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD), prenatal diagnosis (PND) and selective abortion and by identifying and clarifying the key ethical arguments in this context.
Autism
Autism, once thought to be a rare condition, is now estimated to affect 1 in every 100 people (some estimates are 1 in 68). As a complex neurodevelopmental condition autism manifests itself very differently from one person to another, ranging from very high functioning to very low functioning abilities and all the points in between. This course will consider what we actually know about autism spectrum conditions and how best we should understand them. The ethical questions are correspondingly complex. The topic will address some of these, including the crucial question of whether autism is best understood as a disability in all cases or should be understood as an acceptable cognitive difference. Other key issues include the surprising association between autism and talent and how this might affect our thinking about disability, reproductive decision-making and the search for a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for autism.
Neuroethics
Recent advances in the brain sciences offer new ways of learning about ourselves and others, using powerful technologies. These developments raise a range of ethical questions, some that are versions of familiar questions in bioethics, and others that are completely new. This topic addresses both kinds of question, providing a survey of this emerging field. The issues covered include the ethics of incidental findings in the context of neuroscience research; issues arising in the context of new technologies for detecting minimally conscious states; the use of neuroimaging in the courtroom; and the implications of cognitive science for our understanding of morality and freedom.
Autonomy and Public Health
Public health ethics is concerned with justifications for public health programmes, policies and law. Work in this area addresses population-level questions about the promotion and protection of health. This topic focuses on the core tension between individual autonomy and health. The appropriate limits of state action in promoting or preserving health are considered through the examination of: interventions that &ldquo;nudge&rdquo;; the use of health incentives; supported decision-making and a relational understanding of autonomy; and what should be done in the context of contagious disease.
