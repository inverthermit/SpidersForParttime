  The module aims to provide a firm theoretical grounding in cross-cultural literary studies. It is intended primarily for students on the MA Comparative Literature/Literature across Cultures pathway, for which it serves as the core module, but it will also be available to students on the main pathway of the MA Comparative Literature, and may prove valuable to students on other literary MA programmes across the School of Arts and Humanities.

  This course is designed to relate and confront a series of theoretical perspectives that are rarely subjected to a comprehensive critical comparison. From Aristotle to Bakhtin, and beyond, literary critics, philosophers and others have constructed theories of, or have reapplied principles to, comedy. The course seeks to illuminate comedy by looking critically at the main theories and the issues involved, through close study of a series of theoretical or theory-related texts. Among a range of topics, the problematic relationship with tragedy and the question of comic seriousness will be kept in mind throughout.

  Depression nowadays has such a high profile and has been so thoroughly medicalised that it is easily taken for what philosophers call a &lsquo;natural kind&rsquo; - existing out there in nature, independently of what we think about it. It is tempting to take the same view of melancholia and treat it as depression avant la lettre. But how do we square this with the historical phenomena? The 18th century was the second great age of melancholia (after the Renaissance). Like the melancholy geniuses of the Renaissance, 18th century melancholics were credited with the ability to perceive the world more clearly and sharply than non-melancholics. And yet there was also a realisation that this was an illness that needed medical treatment. Others dissented, arguing that the supposed symptoms were imagined, pretended, or created by the medical profession itself. As for the literature of melancholia, it is hard to distinguish between empirical observation of melancholy psychology and mere traditional iconography, or to be sure whether literary melancholia is discursive engagement with a body of knowledge or a form of self-conscious entertainment. As the ever sceptical Georg Christoph Lichtenberg wrote: &lsquo;to write with sensibility requires more than tears and moonlight&rsquo;. So to what extent is there a distinct eighteenth-century literary aesthetics of melancholy?
Our aim is to investigate how these tensions are manifested in the literature of 18th century Britain, Germany and (to a lesser extent and for reasons we may want to discuss) France. A range of canonical authors will be read, including Defoe, Johnson, Hume, Sterne, Rousseau, Goethe, and Schiller. Each week focuses on an issue or theme, which is studied through one or more primary texts and a piece of secondary literature, usually with a strong theoretical slant. Whilst a reading knowledge of French and German will be useful, it is not essential and all primary and theoretical texts (and most secondary literature) are available in translation.

  We will explore the genesis and origins of novels in different cultural and geographical contexts, and discuss how, although the genre&rsquo;s foundations are in the Western tradition, it has been able to successfully transform itself and permeate other literary cultures. The emphasis of this course will be on considering how, from its beginnings in the Hellenistic Mediterranean to its establishment in 19th century Europe, the novel form has always flourished in a multilingual, cross-cultural traffic of ideas. We will question the extent to which the novel has again proved capable of reflecting rapidly-changing conditions of the global world, and of communicating to an even wider and more diverse readership across different cultures.
How the world novel reaches a compromise between global language and local material, and what tensions this gives rise to will be some of the central questions this course will address. We will discuss the relevance of concepts of dominant and subordinate positions in the cultural discourse, and seek to trace the influence of such imbalances in the patterns of conservation and subversion of the norm, both in the sphere of novel writing and consumption.
A range of 20th century authors will be read, including novelists of the early decades of the century like Natsume Soseki and Joseph Roth as well as contemporary writers like Orhan Pamuk and Gao Xingjian.
