It will be the aim of this course to demonstrate that the Cold War was not simply a conflict between the two superpowers, with lesser powers like the UK simply acting as their agents, but that in UK&rsquo;s case the response was based upon the long history of Anglo-Russian and subsequently Anglo-Soviet relations; on the challenges that Britain faced as European power with a declining global Imperial presence; on her position in Europe after the World War II; on her military strength (or weakness); and her determination to remain on the &lsquo;top table&rsquo; of world affairs.

  This course gives an advanced critical study of the political history of Britain since the Second World War. It covers all the major political developments including the political consequences of the war, both Labour and Conservative administrations, foreign policy and the Suez crisis, Europe, immigration and the place of the trade unions. It studies the effects of successive prime ministers in office, their styles of government, and the major public policy issues with which they struggled. It considers changing interpretations of the post war years: thus until the 1970s it was customary to regard this period as one of success, marked by full employment and the development of the welfare state, but from the 1970s many historians see the period as one of national decline. The impact of planning and decolonisation on British society and politics is considered, and the entry into the House of Commons of nationalist parties from the non-English parts of the United Kingdom. The module considers the impact of Thatcherism and then of New Labour on the government and politics of Britain, two powerful movements which seemed for a time all-powerful. By the end of the course, students should be familiar with the main academic controversies amongst historians and political scientists, and be able to argue for their own informed opinions on the issues involved.

  Increasingly within Whitehall and other public institutions, policy-makers are paying attention to the potential benefits of the historical discipline. It is a trend that creates both opportunities and challenges for historians. This module considers from a theoretical and practical perspective the part that history can play in public policy formation. It begins with a consideration of the concept of applied history and its methodology. It then discusses how decision-making processes function, and how history might fit into them without compromising its core values. The module then assesses the different specific openings that exist, such as public consultations, parliamentary inquiries and more informal routes, and the drafting of History   Policy papers. It then presents a series of case-studies in particular policy areas. A number of guest speakers will take part.
