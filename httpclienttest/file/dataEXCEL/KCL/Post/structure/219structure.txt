  Module description
EU administrative law has always been an integral part of the law of the European Union, but has only recently attracted greater attention by academics. Its significance is not only demonstrated by the large number of acts which are adopted every year in this area at European level (some 3,000), but also by the content of those acts (risk regulation through the approval of the release of genetically modified organisms and approval of medicinal products, market regulation through antitrust decisions imposing considerable fines on undertakings, etc). EU administrative law also involves a wide variety of actors (European Commission, national administrations, EU agencies, networks, private bodies) and forms (traditional legal instruments, but also a wide range of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; law).
The aim of this module is to introduce you to the principles of administrative law and policy of the European Union. The module discusses the foundations of EU administrative law, its constitutional framework, its modes of delivery (comitology, agencies, open method of co-ordination, social partner agreements), its procedures (centralised and decentralised), the general principles of law which it has to observe (legal certainty and legitimate expectations, equality, proportionality, the precautionary principle, transparency), and the supervision of EU administrative action (political supervision and judicial review).

  Module description
The EU&rsquo;s external policies are ever more sophisticated and wide-ranging, and the EU is a very active international actor. This module concentrates on studying the legal foundations of the EU&rsquo;s external action. It looks at the scope and nature of the EU&rsquo;s external competences, in particular treaty-making powers and the relationship between international and EU law. It also focuses on a couple of case-studies of major EU external policies, namely the EU&rsquo;s common commercial policy and its common foreign and security policy. Those case-studies will exemplify the interaction between the many facets that shape the EU&rsquo;s external relations. The module aims to give you a thorough grounding in what is a very dynamic subject.

  This module explores the new financial regulatory architecture of the European Union and its economic governance. This is an area, in which the EU has only recently asserted more centralised control, mainly due to the financial problems of financial institutions and Member States following the recent financial crisis. The course will discuss the evolution of financial harmonisation law in the Union, the new institutional architecture of the European Supervisory Authorities, as well as the regulatory and enforcement tools at their disposal. 
In addition, the module will discuss the efforts of the European Union to strengthen its economic governance, in particular within the Eurozone. It will analyse the regulatory arrangements and institutional structures within and outside EU law (Banking Union, European Financial Compact, European Stability Mechanism). Students will discuss the constitutional constraints of the system, its practical operation, and the policy choices and challenges behind the new regulatory regime.
This module is of considerable practical relevance to practising lawyers in the financial services industry, but also for those who are interested in the constitutional and administrative law problems which the new regulatory regime raises.

  Module description
EU public procurement law has emerged as a major area of practice for EU lawyers, bolstered by the increased use of PFI contracts, the introduction of new enforcement procedures in 2009 and a growing volume of cases before the European and Member State courts. This module offers a comprehensive grounding in the EU regime. It covers: 

the policy objectives of the EU public procurement law regime and its foundations in the TFEU;
the substantive rules relating to entities and contracts covered, award procedures, selection of bidders and contract award criteria;
information disclosure requirements, in particular the European courts&rsquo; evolving case law and the relationship with the general principle of transparency and Freedom of Information laws;
the use of public procurement to further social, policy and environmental objectives; and
enforcement mechanisms and practice throughout the EU, including the new Remedies Directive and Article 258 TFEU infraction proceedings.

  Module description
The EU regulation of public undertakings and EU state aid law are increasingly important parts of EU competition law. The case law at national and European levels is growing in both number and importance, particularly of late. The reasons for this increasing focus on public intervention in the economy are numerous and varied but they primarily relate to the impact of such intervention on the completion of the internal market and the current liberalization and privatisation processes. The module focuses on the relevant provisions of the Treaty, most notably Articles 86, 87 and 88; analysing them (and the resulting case law/ decisions) through various legal, political and economic prisms. For more details please see the module outline at the bottom of this page. No previous knowledge of the subject is required.
The module is taught in seminars; you are encouraged to actively engage with the issues being addressed.

  Module description
The concept of a common market involves the elimination of all obstacles to intra-community trade in order to merge the national markets into a single market bringing about conditions as close as possible to those of a genuine internal market&rsquo; (Schul, 1982). The module, by focusing on the development and application of the principle of free movement, assesses whether those objectives have been fully achieved. The structure is firmly grounded on the four fundamental freedoms: goods, persons, services and capital. Each of the freedoms is thoroughly analysed with reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to relevant legislation. &lsquo;Exemplary&rsquo; areas such as financial services, food law or the regulation of monopolies are also included. Particular attention is devoted to the debate on whether the same criteria and principles may be applied to the whole of the internal market and to the degree of convergence of the economic freedoms in EU law.

  Module description
European Labour Law is divided into six parts. 
Part One examines the historical development and evolution of European Labour Law, as well as its economic and social purposes. 
Part Two examines the wider international human rights context within which European Labour Law operates, including in particular the legal instruments of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Council of Europe. 
Part Three examines the institutional competences and framework for the making of European Labour Law, and examines the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the development of the discipline. Consideration is also given to different ways of developing standards at EU level, by way of regulatory legislation and collective bargaining.Thereafter, European Labour Law examines selected areas of substantive law dealing with worker protection. 
In Part Four these include areas dealing with the position of so-called atypical workers (agency, fixed term and part time workers); working conditions (including working time and the protection of posted workers); and job security (including transfer of undertakings, redundancy and insolvency). 
In Part Five the focus turns to collective matters and the duty of the employer to inform and consult, including European Works Councils. 
Part Six deals with recent judicial decisions relating to trade union rights and considers their implications for European Labour Law as a whole.
In addition to the foregoing, time will be devoted to assessing future prospects in light of the current crisis in the Eurozone. Parts One &ndash; Three are dealt with in Semester One, while parts Four &ndash; Six are dealt with in Semester Two. Two &ndash; four classes are devoted to each part.

  EU law impacts in a wide variety of ways on almost every aspect of commercial life in the European Union (and often beyond). This module aims at providing students with the opportunity to gain deeper understanding and knowledge of the impact of EU law in commercial transactions and to develop commercially viable solutions to what are often complex legal issues. Students will have to develop an awareness of how EU law can restrict or facilitate such transactions. They are expected to research selected areas of substantial and procedural aspects of EU law and to employ their knowledge in a commercially relevant way. Students will be confronted with different practical scenarios (be it in meetings where they need to negotiate, or by submitted written documents) on various sides of the transaction (be it as Commission officials, representatives of law firms, general counsel of companies and so on).

  The EU is based on the rule of law and the European integration process has been characterized as &lsquo;integration through law&rsquo;. At the heart of the EU legal system are the EU&rsquo;s judicial institutions, in particular the Court of Justice. On the basis of a few EU Treaty provisions the Court has fashioned a comprehensive and dynamic system of judicial protection. This module studies that system by analysing its two essential components.
It first concentrates on the application and enforcement of EU law in the Member States. In that context the module analyses the concepts of direct effect and Member State liability; the preliminary rulings system; and enforcement actions by the Commission. The second component consists of judical review of EU acts, where you study both actions for annulment and the non-contractual liability of the EU. This module has a strong practical orientation, to make you familiar with the system of EU judicial protection, so as to enable you to use EU remedies in practice.

  In the era marked by the internationally notorious WikiLeaks and Snowden affairs, transparency and openness are becoming buzzwords of most of the debates on government legitimacy and accountability. The European Union is no exception, with the principle of transparency having been progressively integrated into the law, first through the decisions of the Court in relation to the right of access to documents and then, after the 1990s, through Treaty amendments and secondary legislation. Currently enshrined in Article 1 TEU and 15 TFEU, the principle consists essentially of various forms of active cooperation and communication between the EU institutions and the public, typically entailing access to information. However, establishing to what extent open government is also good government is not a straightforward question. Thus, lifting the veil of secrecy over various institutional practices is a matter on which consensus is often hard to reach.
This module aims at enabling reflection on open government at the European Union level. It will explore in depth the principle of transparency and the way it has been rendered operational in EU primary, secondary legislation, and case law, as well as in EU institutional practices. At the theoretical level, the focus is on determining the rationale, the content and the boundaries of the principle of transparency. In particular, we will be assessing the highly contested link between the principles of transparency on the one hand and legitimacy and accountability on the other. The module will also look at the contents of the principle of transparency &ndash; is it just a passive right of every citizen to have access to information or is it a broader concept, entailing a pro-active institutional duty to ensure that all its actions, as well as the information about these actions, are carried out in an accessible and understandable way? Furthermore, we will be discussing the costs of transparency, and to what extent does this principle interact with other fundamental principles such as respect of private life of individuals or impartiality of justice.
These questions shall be contextualised through an analysis of the degree of openness of different European institutions. We will be covering issues ranging from the refusal to grant access to files held by the European Commission, to the disclosure of information on how various countries vote within the Council, and to the reasons for which a large part of the activity of the Court of Justice of the European Union is still exempted from the application of the principle of transparency. The debates will draw mainly on legal arguments, but also on interdisciplinary sources, in particular on theories coming from sociology, political science, and public administration.

  Through the analysis of a case-study, students will apply their knowledge of EU state aid law to develop a hands-on experience of the political, legal, economic and procedural components of EU State aid control.  As in moot court, students will have an opportunity to discuss all aspects of the case taking into account the perspective of all the actors involved in the various phases of State aid control, from the conception of the aid measure, to the investigation, to decision-making and judicial review.
The course will be assessed on the basis of oral and written presentations, and students will be required to work proactively and in teams..
Students wishing to take this option will be required to take the EU State Aid course in the first semester or to prove a good working knowledge of this area of EU law.

  Value Added Tax is an increasingly important tax in the UK and throughout the EU. Not only does it generate a large amount of revenue for governments, its character as a European tax makes for interesting case law and controversy within domestic systems.
This module considers the nature of VAT as a tax and considers the system of VAT as implemented in the UK. It considers the various elements of the tax and how the tax has developed in response to EU movement and pressure.
As well as gaining a comprehensive understanding of VAT in the UK, the aim of the module is to provide you with the tools to be able to comprehend other systems of VAT in Europe and also to understand why what seems like a simple tax has proved so complicated in the EU.
