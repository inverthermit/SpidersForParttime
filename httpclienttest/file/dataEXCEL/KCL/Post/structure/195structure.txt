  The explosion of international business activities has had a marked impact on our lifestyles, income and on the economic environment in general. Companies are forced to seek international trade and investment opportunities in distant markets. Doing business overseas is, however, still considered to be a difficult task. Often we hear stories about unsuccessful encounters between business executives from different cultures mainly because they are not able to communicate and negotiate effectively with each other. Treating negotiations as a technique that can be learned and adapted to international business relations, this module deals with four main inter-related themes: conflict resolution, business negotiations skills, the cross-cultural communication and management of cultural differences in international business deals, and ethical issues in doing business abroad.
