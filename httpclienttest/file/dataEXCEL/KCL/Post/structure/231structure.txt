&bull; Apply these models to inform the design of interventions to promote health-enhancing behaviours
&bull; Critique published research of evaluations of psychological interventions designed to influence health behaviours
&bull; Design the evaluation of a psychologically-informed health behaviour intervention
Please note: psychology research makes considerable use of statistics.
