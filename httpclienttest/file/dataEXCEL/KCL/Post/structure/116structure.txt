  In this module, students will be introduced to the range of research methods available to social scientists. They will be provided with a theoretical and critical understanding of the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, and of mixed methods, and equipped with methodological skills and analytic techniques with which to formulate research questions and develop a valid and reliable approach to both quantitative and qualitative research design, data collection, data analysis and data representation. 
This module will also enable students to identify and address methodological and practical issues that may be encountered in conducting qualitative and/or quantitative research; and to reflect on and address the ethical and political implications pertaining to the collection, analysis and dissemination of research data.

In parallel, students will be introduced to key concepts and issues related to informal education, pedagogy and learning within/through culture and the arts. The overarching aim of this module is to inform reflexive approaches to the conception, design and delivery of educational practice within arts and cultural organisations.

  The aim of this module is to develop students&rsquo; work-related knowledge, skills and capabilities via a pre-approved and monitored internship placement within an approved host arts and cultural organisation, in the UK or abroad. It offers students who opt for it the opportunity to have a grounded understanding of education and learning in arts and cultural work environments, organisational structures and working practices and techniques relevant to the arts cultural sector through work-based learning, reflective learning and field research. 
Observation of and participation in the practice field can also provide students with a good understanding of the knowledge, skills and capabilities needed to support further career development in educational roles within arts and cultural settings. At the end of the process students will be able to critically assess their personal professional development over the course of the internship, including with regard to i) securing an appropriate internship project; ii) working in the context of the internship project; and iii) understanding how this experience relates to their longer-term career goals.
Students must spend at least 160 hours (20 working days) on the internship placement.

  Those tasked with managing today&rsquo;s educational institutions are confronted with all manner of problems which require them constantly to assess priorities in the face of competing demands. Rising to this challenge requires a rich understanding of the social, economic and political contexts within which schools and other educational institutions must operate. The last two or three decades have seen profound changes in the demands placed on schools and those who manage them. School principals, headteachers and those in senior and middle leadership roles need to be alert to a wide range of issues arising from questions about educational quality, equity and accountability, questions about organisational change and the difficulties faced by schools required to succeed in an education &lsquo;market&rsquo;. In this module we go beyond mere &lsquo;problem-solving&rsquo; techniques to adopt a more purposeful and critical analysis of the problems facing educational institutions today, both in the UK and around the world.

  This module is designed to provide a framework through which to examine the conflicting aims, claims, values and beliefs which have underpinned educational provision over time. The module considers several key social science concepts or fields of study with education as the major substantive focus and processes of social change providing the major context of concern. The key concepts include: gender, 'race', class, reproduction theory, globalisation, the market, the politics of knowledge and performativity. The overall aim of the module is to introduce students to a set of concepts, theories and ideas which will enable them to place their own subject interests in relation to wider social, political and economic changes taking place in modern society.
