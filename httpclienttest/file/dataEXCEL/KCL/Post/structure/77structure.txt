   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  In order to gain MA Computing in Education, students must complete and pass four taught modules (30 credits each) and a dissertation (60 credits). There are no examinations - all modules are assessed by written work.
The programme may be taken over one year (full time) or two years (part time). A serving teacher would normally complete the MA on a part time basis and complete one module in each of the autumn and spring terms in year 1, plus a further two modules and the dissertation in year 2. 
The sessions for each module normally take place on one evening each week from 5.30 - 7.30pm at the Waterloo Campus. The compulsory Recent Developments in Digital Technologies in Education module involves two face-to-face sessions on Saturdays and 10 online sessions.
Students who have gained 60 master's level credits as part of their PGCE can normally transfer these in, and would then only have to complete two 30 credit taught modules instead of four, plus the dissertation.  Please note that the period between first registration on the previous programme of study and the date of the College award will not normally exceed ten years. For example, if you are intending to start the MA as a part time student in September 2015 and you would like to transfer in master&rsquo;s level credits from your PGCE, you must have started your PGCE in 2007 or later.

  This module will introduce a broad range of current major developments associated with ICT in education. In particular it will include a consideration of computational thinking in the curriculum and its importance for learning. Students may be from a range of subject areas including computer science and they will consider computational thinking as well as the use of computers and the Internet in their subjects for learning, teaching and the curriculum, the nature of educational software, how learners may be changing in the digital age and the impact of new technologies such as multimedia and social networking software. Other areas covered include web-based learning, the role of computer-mediated communications, pedagogy with technology, modelling, learning though gaming, mobile learning and e-assessment. Module teaching is comprised of two face-to-face workshops held at the start and middle of the module on a Saturday together with weekly tasks and readings in ten on-line sessions. Online activities each week will involve:
A task related to the week's theme usually including the study of a specific paper, with each student posting their reactions, comments and reflections to an on-line asynchronous discussion board for others to view and respond. Online synchronous (chat) seminars in small groups to discuss the week's theme. These happen on the same evening each week.

  In times of great challenge and flux, it is very important that mathematics teachers and mathematics consultants, policy makers and managers are able to critique their work in terms of the rich traditions of the mathematics education curriculum. By the end of the module, participants will be able to delineate the main assumptions behind a range of theoretical frameworks for conceptualising and analysing the learning and teaching of mathematics and their implications for policy and classroom practice. In particular, participants will engage with core readings in learning theories (from cognitive constructivist, socio-cultural, interactionist, to sociological perspectives), and the teaching and assessment frameworks they often imply. Through their encounter with seminal scholarly texts, participants will develop a critical perspective on contemporary schemes currently impacting on mathematics learning, teaching and assessment, and shaping alternatives for the future. Developing academic skills (reading and writing and argumentation based on scholarly sources and critique) will be an important emphasis of the module.

  Policies are developed in order to tackle what are perceived to be social issues or problems. For example, currently we have policies which aim to include children, students and all learners in society in order to improve their life chances. However, concerns about 'problems' in society are not new. In the nineteenth century in Britain, the movement of many people from the country-side to the newly emerging cities was accompanied by social changes and concerns about poverty, poor housing, child labour and what were viewed as the threats of the growing urban working class. It became accepted that the government (the state) would have to do something about these issues. Social policies were enacted to try to ameliorate these problems. Obviously education &ndash; the focus of this module - was one form of policy intervention. In this module we want to consider the origins of state intervention (policy) into educational provision. We will examine how and why certain policies were taken up, which ideologies have dominated at certain times and we will explore the sorts of policy outcomes which have come from all this. We want to consider how policies are developed and how they are implemented. We also want to consider how they change in the different contexts in which they are interpreted, experienced, enacted and/or resisted as well as through the actions of those charged with their implementation. Our module title includes the word 'city' because it is in cities that we can most easily see the way in which educational and other policies do their work and are resisted/ appropriated/impact on the lives of those who 'people policy'.
  
"The city concentrates and makes highly visible the contrasts between the rich and the poor. This concentration and visibility means that conflicts over scarce resources, not least education, between rich and poor are more likely, more extreme, and in turn, more visible in urban areas" (Coulby, 1992, p. 221)

  The idea that the role of managing education should involve &lsquo;leadership&rsquo; has come to prominence around the world in recent years, not least because leadership has come to be seen as the means of achieving organisational change and improvement. Today it is not just headteachers and college principals who are involved in leadership; increasingly leadership is seen as something that permeates throughout the organisation, something that might potentially involve many or even all of the staff in a school or college. Recent official policy has made much of the need for leadership, yet there is a need to distinguish between official rhetoric and educational reality. In this module we look beyond the rhetoric to consider what it takes to be a leader, the kind of knowledge and abilities it requires. We also look at some of the challenges of leadership and the responsibilities leadership brings. What participants should take away from this module is a richer and fuller understanding of how leadership can properly contribute to the running of an educational institution.

  What can you learn from comparing education systems, schools or teachers? International comparisons have recently risen to prominence in the education policy discourse. At its best, comparative education can inform us about learning in different places or times and can provide us with fresh perspectives on ourselves. When we engage in international comparative education, differences are often stark. A world of alternatives opens up to us - with the capacity to challenge and reassure in equal measure. But caution is advisable. When we observe differences, what are the less visible factors we need to account for? When we find trends across countries, do they reflect national consensus or international pressures? What then is the influence of organisations such as the OECD, UNESCO, the World Bank and the EU? The question arises: are policy makers&rsquo; interpretations justified or do they merely reflect pre-set political imperatives? In this module, we will: familiarise ourselves with the field of comparative education; consider the relationship between education and aspects of national contexts; evaluate the methodology, contribution and limitations of international comparative education; and, identify international trends in curriculum, assessment and pedagogy. During the module, students will be required to identify a topic for their written assignment. One session will be devoted to short presentations on initial exploration of the topic and formative feedback for the full assignment. Students will benefit from the international perspectives of the tutors, outside speakers, and their fellow students.

  This module aims to extend students&rsquo; understanding of the key theories that underpin modern foreign language teaching and learning and to explore how these concepts can be applied effectively in different language teaching practices and contexts represented by students in the group. Topics include a critical approach to the communicative language teaching, new insights into learner motivation, the increasingly important topic of learning/learner strategies, content-based language learning, collaborative learning and the linguistic and cultural representations modelled through film in the classroom. Students, having examined a range of teaching and learning approaches and the underlying theoretical precepts, will relate these to their own cultural and educational contexts. The module is interactive, being based on active learning methods and is very student-focused. The session formats are varied and involve both personal reflection and collaborative study as we learn together as a learning group. All sessions draw on data collected by students for the session in order to develop research skills. Key texts are identified for each session and draw on a wide range of international research. Students choose to focus on a related topic in greater depth for their end-of-module essay which is agreed by the module tutor. Support is provided for assignment writing.

  This is an optional module that provides an introduction to principles and applications of Psychology to Learning in formal and informal contexts. Over the last three decades, psychological theories and explanation of learning have developed far beyond simple, mechanistic models (such as reinforcement) that are applied in formal settings (especially schools). Within this module, participants will have the opportunity to explore: individual and social circumstances that may promote or hinder learning; characteristics of learning in formal and informal contexts; and individual and social theories of learning. Further, the module will explore how theories of learning have been adapted and ignored in education policies: at pre-school, primary and secondary school levels; with regard to curriculum; and with regard to assessment. In considering explanations of learning, the module will consider issues of development, multiple intelligences, interpersonal support that underlies learning and the effect of culture/activity on learning experience.

  Those tasked with managing today&rsquo;s educational institutions are confronted with all manner of problems which require them constantly to assess priorities in the face of competing demands. Rising to this challenge requires a rich understanding of the social, economic and political contexts within which schools and other educational institutions must operate. The last two or three decades have seen profound changes in the demands placed on schools and those who manage them. School principals, headteachers and those in senior and middle leadership roles need to be alert to a wide range of issues arising from questions about educational quality, equity and accountability, questions about organisational change and the difficulties faced by schools required to succeed in an education &lsquo;market&rsquo;. In this module we go beyond mere &lsquo;problem-solving&rsquo; techniques to adopt a more purposeful and critical analysis of the problems facing educational institutions today, both in the UK and around the world.

  The idea that the effectiveness of a school can be evaluated in &lsquo;objective&rsquo; or &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; terms has taken hold in a good many countries in recent years, not least in the USA and the UK. Similarly, with the idea of school improvement: in many countries, official policy is based on the assumption that such improvement can be measured and its conditions reliably predicted. These ideas are bolstered by a burgeoning body of research into school effectiveness and school improvement. In this module we subject these ideas to critical scrutiny, examining their conceptual and methodological underpinnings in order to assess whether the claims arising from such research are justified. This module will be of interest to anyone who has ever wondered about the meaningfulness and educational worth of SATs, school league tables and other measures used to hold schools and teachers to account; it will be of particular interest to those who seek to have a comprehensive understanding of such measures with a view to managing their implementation in schools or other educational institutions.

  This module is designed to provide a framework through which to examine the conflicting aims, claims, values and beliefs which have underpinned educational provision over time. The module considers several key social science concepts or fields of study with education as the major substantive focus and processes of social change providing the major context of concern. The key concepts include: gender, 'race', class, reproduction theory, globalisation, the market, the politics of knowledge and performativity. The overall aim of the module is to introduce students to a set of concepts, theories and ideas which will enable them to place their own subject interests in relation to wider social, political and economic changes taking place in modern society.

  This module considers what is meant by the concept of social justice and explores some of the difficulties involved in trying to enact socially just practices in education policy. It will consider tensions between distributive, cultural and associational forms of justice by looking at some examples of contexts in which these tensions arise. Each session will focus on a different axis of social differentiation, for example, poverty, disability, sexuality and faith.

  In recent years, the gaze of researchers and policy makers has focused increasingly on teachers and teacher change. In this module, teacher development is considered as an area of knowledge from a range of perspectives including historical, philosophical, ethical, sociological, ethical, and political. Within these various concepts of 'teacher' are introduced and tensions among them explored. These include notions of the teacher as, for example: domain knowledge specialist; curriculum worker; bureaucrat; exemplary life coach and pastoral carer, and so on. The roles and representations of teachers (for example, as 'professionals' or as 'change agents') are explored in depth. Teachers' careers touching on their social, personal and professional growth are considered e.g., the reflective practitioner, the competence facilitator, the practitioner and practice oriented researcher, the professional leader, educational manager. Participants are expected to use their knowledge and experience of their own and their colleagues' development to interpret and inform their reading and discussions.
