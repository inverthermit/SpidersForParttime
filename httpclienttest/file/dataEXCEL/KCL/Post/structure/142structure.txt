  The first part of the module will focus more heavily on methodology and study skills. The methodological sessions will try to help you develop your skills in such areas as conducting surveys and assessing opinion polls, analyzing different forms of primary and secondary sources, and balancing theory with empirical research. They will also look at how wider theoretical debates surrounding European identity might influence methodological approaches.
In the second part of the module there will be four thematic sessions. The thematic sessions will examine whether there is actually such a thing as a common European identity. In particular they will investigate different attempts to construct one through the exploration of a variety of case studies on issues concerning debates over citizenship, faith, state institutions, the constitution or law. A key component of these sessions will be group work, in which students can also set out their own ideas when debating concepts of European identity.

  This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the history, institutions and politics of European integration since 1945. It begins by evaluating competing theories of integration that help us to explain the historical development of the EU. It then analyses the institutional framework established for managing this process and how and why it has evolved over time. The course ends by investigating the nature, development and rationale behind key EU policies &ndash; including economic and monetary union, foreign and defence policy, and justice and home affairs &ndash; as well as briefly considering the wider democratic implications of ever closer union.

  This module will explore literary responses (in English translation) by Italian and Spanish writers to conflict and division in their respective societies, from the early 20th Century to the present. Common to the history of both is the experience and legacy of dictatorship and a community driven by highly polarized political ideologies and discourses. Although the markedly different trajectories of Italian Fascism and Francoism mean that over the course of the 20th Century writers in Italy and Spain come to engage with divergent political and social realities, social crisis, division and dysfunction continue to provide points of connection. This module will set the respective accounts of Italian and Spanish writers in their historical context and examine and compare their various approaches to the circumstances and events which their works depict. It will consider literary representation, device and effect, along with the ideological framework informing perspectives, encountering in the process a range of subjects and themes arising from these writers&rsquo; engagement with the political and social realities of their time; subjects and themes such as totalitarianism, civil conflict, organized crime, rural and urban deprivation, censorship, exile, social anomie and alienation, social responsibility and complicity, collective amnesia, political disillusionment, historical recuperation. In this way, the module aims to offer students an insight into the ways culture responds to conflict and division, as well as an understanding of two historically conflictual and divided societies via the unique, and often intimate, perspective which literature provides.

  Economic integration remains at the core of what the EU is and why it exists. Today it constitutes the largest and most integrated single market in the world. But how is it governed? The module sets out to explore the development, structures and policies that characterise economic integration &ndash; in particular, the single market, monetary union, economic and fiscal coordination, employment and social policy, and cohesion policy. Drawing on theories of European integration, political economy and comparative politics, it analyses the distinctive &lsquo;modes&rsquo; of governance that the EU employs in these different policy fields &ndash; from &lsquo;hard&rsquo; supranational policy making through to &lsquo;soft&rsquo; informal coordination and learning. The course concludes by addressing two fundamental issues. Firstly, what are the democratic implications of economic union without political union, and is this sustainable or desirable? Secondly, what has been the impact of the global financial crisis on economic governance, and how can the EU respond to it? The module therefore seeks to provide a clearer understanding of how and why the EU shapes our lives to a greater extent than ever before.

  Module description
EU administrative law has always been an integral part of the law of the European Union, but has only recently attracted greater attention by academics. Its significance is not only demonstrated by the large number of acts which are adopted every year in this area at European level (some 3,000), but also by the content of those acts (risk regulation through the approval of the release of genetically modified organisms and approval of medicinal products, market regulation through antitrust decisions imposing considerable fines on undertakings, etc). EU administrative law also involves a wide variety of actors (European Commission, national administrations, EU agencies, networks, private bodies) and forms (traditional legal instruments, but also a wide range of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; law).
The aim of this module is to introduce you to the principles of administrative law and policy of the European Union. The module discusses the foundations of EU administrative law, its constitutional framework, its modes of delivery (comitology, agencies, open method of co-ordination, social partner agreements), its procedures (centralised and decentralised), the general principles of law which it has to observe (legal certainty and legitimate expectations, equality, proportionality, the precautionary principle, transparency), and the supervision of EU administrative action (political supervision and judicial review).

  Module description
The EU&rsquo;s external policies are ever more sophisticated and wide-ranging, and the EU is a very active international actor. This module concentrates on studying the legal foundations of the EU&rsquo;s external action. It looks at the scope and nature of the EU&rsquo;s external competences, in particular treaty-making powers and the relationship between international and EU law. It also focuses on a couple of case-studies of major EU external policies, namely the EU&rsquo;s common commercial policy and its common foreign and security policy. Those case-studies will exemplify the interaction between the many facets that shape the EU&rsquo;s external relations. The module aims to give you a thorough grounding in what is a very dynamic subject.

  Module description
The concept of a common market involves the elimination of all obstacles to intra-community trade in order to merge the national markets into a single market bringing about conditions as close as possible to those of a genuine internal market&rsquo; (Schul, 1982). The module, by focusing on the development and application of the principle of free movement, assesses whether those objectives have been fully achieved. The structure is firmly grounded on the four fundamental freedoms: goods, persons, services and capital. Each of the freedoms is thoroughly analysed with reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to relevant legislation. &lsquo;Exemplary&rsquo; areas such as financial services, food law or the regulation of monopolies are also included. Particular attention is devoted to the debate on whether the same criteria and principles may be applied to the whole of the internal market and to the degree of convergence of the economic freedoms in EU law.

  The  module aims to introduce a range of analytical approaches to the study of security in Europe today and develop a detailed knowledge and understanding of the main issues and developments since the end of the Cold War. It focuses on the response of states and international organisations to the new security challenges and considers the nature of the emerging security order. It analyses the ways in which NATO, the EU and the OSCE have adapted to the post Cold War and post 9/11 security environment, the relationship between them and their respective roles in providing security. The role of the US in Europe and the debate over the future of the transatlantic security partnership will be critically explored. National perspectives on European security issues are also considered through the comparative study of the defence policies of France, Germany, the UK, Russia and a selection of other European states. The  module concludes with a number of case-studies on specific issues and regions in order to bring together both the conceptual and empirical themes of the course.

  To what extent has the EU become a unitary actor in foreign affairs with the ability to project a common interest across a range of policy areas? What influence do member states have on common policies and actions as compared to EU institutions? And how does the EU reconcile conflicts between economic, humanitarian and security goals? These are three of the central questions to be tackled by this module. It will provide you with a sound understanding of the legal basis, complexity, range and impact of the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy(ies) in a more globalised world. It will also help you distinguish and competently apply a range of theoretical approaches used to conceptualise the EU as a foreign actor and to analyse its decision-making dynamics. The module aims to advance students understanding of the EU&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses as it related to other major states, international organisations and other non-governmental actors.

  This module offers a theoretical overview of current debates about the nature and origins of globalisation and examines various aspects of the economics of global capital along with their social and political consequences. The geopolitical reconfiguration ushered in by the collapse of the Eastern Bloc will be examined in relation to the crisis of Western liberalism and the emergence of new forms of resistance to globalisation. Do such movements represent defensive &lsquo;resistance identities&rsquo; or an attempt to create new public spaces and new forms of community? The module will conclude with an assessment of the extent to which the existing literature on social movements is able to respond to such questions, followed by an examination of alternative societal models to global capitalism. Students will develop their analytical skills in coming to terms with a wide-ranging contemporary debate which engages with various key theoretical issues in the fields of economics, sociology and political science.

  Human Rights and Migration adopts a socio-legal approach to questions relating migration and human rights. In doing do, it stresses the significance of political context in the construction of legal frameworks dealing with the politically charged question of the movement of peoples across national boundaries and examines these in relation to the agencies and institutions of the European Union. Each session considers the theoretical issue relating to human rights and migration, how the question is dealt with in international treaties, and what the implications are for migrants.
  
Aims:
The aims of the module are:
To promote in students an advanced understanding of the relationship between human rights law and the movement of people across national boundaries.  The focus throughout will be on the interrelationships both supportive and conflictual between the domestic law within states dealing with migration, EU law and International Law.

Expose students to cutting edge analyses which examine the political forces influencing the legal changes mentioned in point 3 above
Explore the ways in which forced migration is being dealt with in national and international law.Make explicit the opportunities which exist in domestic, EU and International law for migrants to seek remedies which will protect their fundamental human rights in the face of hostile political forces.  In doing this detailed consideration will be given to recent developments in the case law pertaining to these matters.
Study the links between human rights law, family law and migration.
Explore the economic outcomes of migration and how it has affected human rights law.
  
  
Learning Outcomes:

Understand the legal framework relating to   refugees and asylum seekers within the European Union and the   transformations taking place therein.    In doing this students will be able to demonstrate an ability to   find their way around a complicated knowledge base which includes law   reports, constitutions, legal text books, works in the field of   international relations and also reports in the quality press.
Appreciate the political context surrounding   the complex relationship between human rights and migration policies   within the European context.
Engage with some of the thorny ethical issues   which are raised by the legal and political disputes surrounding the   problems of migration.
Understand and analyse the issue of forced   migration and the protection of refugees under international human rights   law.
Understand the question of rights and how this   relates to family life across national boundaries.Assess the impact of economic migration on   human rights law

  This module is designed to introduce students to the most influential contemporary debates on the role of political parties in European political systems and on their recent transformations in the framework of European integration. It will also examine the causes of Europe&rsquo;s growing political instability and crisis of representation, as expressed by phenomena such as the rising turnover of parties in government, low turnouts, emergence of &ldquo;incomers&rdquo; (radical forces from either right or left) in almost all party systems. The module will not focus on single parties or party systems, but will rather analyze political parties in comparative perspective. More specifically, the first part of the module will first focus on the main theoretical approaches to understand political parties (elite theories, political market approaches, catch-all, mass, electoral-professional and cartel-party models). The second part of the module will analyze in detail recent changes in party organizations (membership, leadership selection, party finance and regulation) party ideology (party families, anti-system parties, cartelization) and the &lsquo;Europeanization&rsquo; of political parties (understood both as the impact of the EU on the national party systems and the consolidation of political parties at the EU level).

  The relationship between the EU and Asia is one of the key drivers of developments in the international system. Whereas in the past relations between these two regions were driven by economics, today political and security calculations are equally central to understand the dynamics of their interactions. This module addresses the relationship between the EU and Asia by looking at their relations at the regional level, as well as by analysing bilateral relations between the EU and key Asian countries. Particular attention will be given to how developments in the international system affect EU-Asia interactions and to how these interactions impact international relations.

  The theoretical aim of the module is, first, to understand the problem of migration, both legal and illegal, in the context of globalisation; and, second, to assess the relation between globalisation, marginalisation and the EU response to threats of mass immigration from less developed countries. The Unit therefore focuses on the following theoretical questions:
How is the process of globalisation related to the increase of migratory flows from less developed countries to Western ones?
What are the main political and economic causes and consequences of migration, in general, and illegal migration, in particular?
Is there tension between legal and illegal migration?

  This course examines, compares and contrasts the representation of war in two types of discourse other than the historical and human science idioms which are mainstream in War Studies and considers what 'philosophy' and 'literature' have in common, and how they may be fruitfully contrasted, in their treatment of military affairs. The course will explore the strengths and limitations of elucidating general questions about types of discourse through the close reading of particular 'great' texts. This will include assessing the pairing of Homer's Iliad with Plato's Republic, and two other suitably paired texts, such as a Shakespeare play with Hobbes's 'Leviathan' and Tolstoi's 'War and Peace' with Nietzsche's 'Genealogy of Morals' as models for any philosophical-literary study of war.
