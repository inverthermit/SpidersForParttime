   FORMAT AND ASSESSMENT
  Modular programme consisting of 180 credits, plus an additional 300 credits of non-modular supervised clinical work and, for KCL Candidates, a further 60 credits compromising the Graduate Certificate in Academic Practice are offered to those students whose academic progress is appropriate. Modules are grouped into three distinct types: 1) Two taught modules, covering the scientific and clinical basis of orthodontics assessed by written examination; 2) One clinical module, involving supervised clinical practice and examined by a mixture of case studies on treated and unseen patients, practical, or oral examinations; 3) One research module, involving the submission of a research project report including a literature review, with an oral examination.
