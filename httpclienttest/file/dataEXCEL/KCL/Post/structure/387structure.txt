  On completion of the module, students will be able to demonstrate substantive knowledge and critical appreciation of:
The functioning of freshwater, estuarine and coastal systems, and of the management and sustainable exploitation of their resources
The current and emerging issues and priorities in freshwater and estuarine management. Such issues include, inter alia, the implications of climate change; the development of approaches to water resource exploitation that balance human and environmental needs; the scientific underpinning of methods for management, enhancement and restoration; the development and monitoring of targets for ecosystem integrity; the interface between scientific tools for environmental management / assessment and their application in decision and policy making.
Contemporary and controversial issues in water management is informed and enhanced by external experts and practitioners, who either contribute directly as external lecturers or with whom regular liaison is maintained, and by student visits to agencies and enterprises involved in water management or exploitation.

  This module will provide a general introduction to the MSc programme in Aquatic Resource Management, with emphasis on the practical application of biological and physicochemical field techniques including survey and sampling methods; laboratory and statistical analysis of field samples and survey data; and interpretation of the results obtained. To provide direct hands-on experience at the outset of the MSc programme. In addition to these scientific and educational aims, the one week residential field course promotes integration of the student group and provides a valuable opportunity for staff and students to get to know each other.

  This module is entirely undertaken through a field-based programme at Millport Marine Biological Station. It provides knowledge and understanding of the stresses affecting the marine and estuarine environments, by reference to four main topic areas or themes, namely: biodiversity and conservation; mariculture and hydrography; environmental stresses and pollution; environmental microbiology. The module develops knowledge and understanding of the management and sustainable exploitation of marine and estuarine resources; an understanding and experience of methods for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of coastal and offshore habitats and biota; an awareness and understanding of current and emerging issues and priorities in marine and estuarine research and management.

  This module provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the recent history of water resource allocation and management especially in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Priority will be given to outlining a conceptual framework identifying the relevant underlying ecological, economic and sociological principles relevant in the evaluation and management of water resources. The conceptual framework will also show the link between these underlying principles and environmental and economic policies. The roles of the institutions and technologies through which such policies can be implemented will also be analysed and exemplified.
