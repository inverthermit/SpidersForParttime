Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.


 Foundation year

 
  This course is for students who lack the qualifications needed for direct entry onto Stage 1 of the degree programmes. The foundation year is taught entirely on the Canterbury campus and caters for students with a wide range of backgrounds and experience. Successful completion of the foundation year guarantees entry onto any of the School&rsquo;s physics or astronomy degree courses.
