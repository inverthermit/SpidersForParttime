      EC302 - Introduction to Economics

      
      
       This module has been designed for students who need to study what is often described as a Principles of Economics course. Each economics topic is introduced assuming no previous knowledge of the subject. The lectures and related seminar programme explain the economic principles underlying the analysis of each topic and relate the concepts to the real world. In particular, many examples are taken from the real world to show how economic analysis and models can be used to understand the different parts of the economy and how policy has been used to intervene in the working of the economy. This module aims to introduce you to the basic principles of Economics, to the main ways in which economists think about problems and to the important current economic issues in the United Kingdom, the European Union and the world economy. The module is self-contained, so that if you do not study Economics further, you should have a basic understanding of economic methods and debates. It is also suitable as a basis for further modules that you may take in economics, either as part of an Economics degree or as part of another degree programme or as part of a future professional qualification.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      AC508 - Principles of Finance

      
      
       This module is concerned with the principles which underlie the investment and financing decision making process. Before a rational decision can be made objectives need to be considered and models need to be built. Short-term decisions are dealt with first, together with relevant costs. One such cost is the time value of money. This leads to long term investment decisions which are examined using the economic theory of choice, first assuming perfect capital markets and certainty. These assumptions are then relaxed so that such problems as incorporating capital rationing and risk into the investment decision are fully considered. The module proceeds by looking at the financing decision. The financial system within which business organisations operate is examined, followed by the specific sources and costs of long and short-term capital, including the management of fixed and working capital.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
