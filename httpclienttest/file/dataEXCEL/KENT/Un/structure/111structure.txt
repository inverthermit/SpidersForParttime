      CP325 - World Literature:An Introduction

      
      
       This module introduces students to some of the most influential theories of World Literature, which are studied alongside a selection of literary examples. The theories include Johann Wolfgang von Goethes reflections formulated in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Goethe coined the term world literature [Weltliteratur] to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in Europe. In the course of the module, we reflect on the relationship between national literatures and world literature, and on the ways in which the literary market facilitates and complicates transnational exchanges of ideas. In addition, students are given the opportunity to hone their close reading skills by studying a selection of ancient and modern world creation myths. These include texts from the Near East, Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe. The module offers students the unique opportunity to analyse in detail different ways in which cultural backgrounds can shape literary productions, and how stories, motifs and themes travel across national boundaries. In the course of the module, we discuss key literary terms and concepts, including fictionality, literariness, translation, the canon, and the various modes of reception and circulation that shape our understanding of world literature.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      PO658 - The Rise of China

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with a critical review of Chinas hegemonic role in pre-modern East Asia and its political development since the 1840s when it was forced to open up to the outside world and to lay a solid foundation for even more detailed study of present-day China. It deals with a recurrent theme in the study of Chinese politics, that is, how successive Chinese leaderships since the 1840s have reconciled Chinese indigenous political culture with models of modernisations that originated in the West. Focus is on how indigenous and foreign models for state-building and political development have guided Chinese thinking about national rejuvenation and modernisation. This module assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese history or politics, and introduces students to the defining features of the Chinese traditional political system, including: Confucianism and Legalism, the causes of the demise of imperial China in 1911, the abortive attempts of republicanism and constitutionalism between 1912 and 1949, the rise of communism, and major political events since 1949 as well as its recent ascendancy. Questions to be explored in this module include: Why did the Chinese imperial system fail to meet the challenges and encroachment from the West and Japan? How did Chinese leaders understand modernisation? Why did Chinese political elites embrace communism? What have been the impacts of revolutions on Chinas external behaviour and relations, post-1949? How has Chinas worldview been socially constructed in its interactions with Western powers? What is Chinas grand strategy for development in the early 21st century?

      FR593 - Paris: Myth and Reality in the 19th century

      
      
       Among the capital cities of Europe, Paris has a particularly rich and interesting history.  In the revolution of 1789 and subsequent political upheavals in the course of the nineteenth century (1830, 1848, 1870-71), the city played a key role in deciding the fate of the nation.  In the same period, it grew dramatically in size and emerged as a modern metropolis.  Widely divergent views were expressed as to the wholesomeness of city living; opinion differed equally violently among writers as to the benefits to be derived from the explosive growth of the city. The module will examine conditions of life in the real Paris of the 19th Century and in particular the radical and highly controversial changes to the face of the city brought about during the Second Empire under the direction of Baron Haussmann.  The main focus of the module, however, will be the images of the city as mediated in contemporary fiction (Balzac and Zola amongst others), poetry (Baudelaire) and painting (Manets vision of city life).

A certain amount of historical background reading will be essential. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      FR599 - Description of Modern French

      
      
       Written and spoken French are now, arguably, so far apart as to constitute distinct varieties. Unlike most French modules, this module will take the latter as its starting point. The phonology (sound system) will first be explored, and basic transcription skills acquired, with consideration of recent and ongoing changes in the general system known as fran&ccedil;ais standard. The module will then move on to consider the gap between written and spoken French grammar, notably in such areas as the tense/mood system, morphosyntax or pronouns, grammatical gender and agreement, and verb classification. The treatment of neologisms, and particularly the status of franglais in contemporary French, will also be considered. Although the module will provide students with some basic tools of linguistic description, no background in Linguistics is required or assumed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      FR620 - Memory and Childhood in 20th Century French Fiction

      
      
       It is commonly accepted that identity or a sense of self is constructed by and through narrative  the stories we tell ourselves and each other about our lives. This module explores the complex relationships that exist between memory, nostalgia, writing and identity in a range of twentieth-century autobiographical and first- and third-person fictional works in French. These texts foreground issues of childhood, memory, history, and trauma in the construction of identity.

      FR632 - Modern French Theatre

      
      
       This module allows students to study plays by major French writers and to explore the techniques they used, both verbal and visual, to renew the art of theatre during the first half of the twentieth century. It will include plays in French by major authors such as Apollinaire, Cocteau, Sartre and Ionesco. Taking one play each week, the syllabus will be approached in broadly chronological order, with emphasis given to diversity but also to continuing links and developments, such as the use and influence of popular culture, politics and classical mythology.

      FR546 - Short Narrative Fiction in French

      
      
       This module will introduce a selection of short narrative fiction in French drawn from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It will reflect on the techniques and forms used by a number of authors and inquire whether short fictions tend to display common features.  The authors chosen use the form in a wide variety of ways, from illustrating a philosophical position to dramatising an ethical dilemma or even questioning the conventions of fiction themselves.  The texts will be considered with some reference to concepts drawn from general theory of narrative.

      FR638 - French Detective Fiction

      
      
       Detective fiction is an extremely popular genre whose basic template can give rise to a multitude of approaches, settings, plots and values. This course is designed to give students an overview of the tradition of French crime fiction as it has evolved from the mid-19th century to the early 21st century. Short crime fiction, full crime novels, and film will be analysed. Close attention will be paid to generic conventions, and how they alter over time. Questions of social order and disorder will be central to our enquiry. We will also study the extent to which detective novels mount a critique of contemporary society. All texts are studied in French and teaching is partly in English, partly in French. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      FR637 - Travels to Japan in Modern French Culture

      
      
       This course examines the portrayal of Japan in French and Belgian writing and culture from the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Since Japan was opened to the West in the mid-19th century, there has been a tradition of French literary japanophilia. The course will permit a critical evaluation of the evolution of French japonisme, from its exoticist beginnings in the work of Pierre Loti, through the travel writing of early- and mid- 20th century authors, to  the portrayal of contemporary Japan in Am&eacute;lie Nothombs and Jacques Roubauds work. Japoniste images by French Impressionist painters will also be studied, as will a cinematic adaptation of Nothombs work. The study of these texts and images will involve the exploration of themes such as: intercultural understanding (or the lack thereof); the idealisation or demonisation of the other; the way in which French writers turn to the foreign culture in order to critique their own culture; the nature of Orientalism; genre (what is travel writing? what are its limits?).

      FR621 - Writing on Art: Text and Image in Modern French Culture

      
      
       The eighteenth-century 'philosophe' Denis Diderot was the first major French author to write at length about painting, and he bequeathed to later writers such as Baudelaire a new literary genre, the 'salon'. The mutual influence of literature and the visual arts is a major theme of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French culture, and an important area of current research. The module will begin with a study of a selection of passages from Diderot's 'Salon de1767'. We will then examine Balzac's 'Le Chef d'oeuvre inconnu' and 'Sarrasine', Baudelaire's 'Le Peintre de la vie moderne', Zola's 'L'Oeuvre', a selection from Proust's 'A la recherche du temps perdu', and Georges Perecs 'Un Cabinet damateur.

      FR601 - Mothers and Daughters in Women's Writing

      
      
       The module is designed to acquaint students with samples of the main trends within the work of Twentieth Century Women writers by paying close attention to the relations between mothers and their daughters who become writers. Each novel chosen is one of personal analysis of the often-violent relationship between the mothers and their daughters who turn to writing in a search for identity and liberation from the mother or maternal figure of their youth. Students analyse the texts in order to evaluate how the picture of the mother has evolved. We will pay close attention to the underlying theme of the progression of the role of women in French society. Each text will also provide us with a variety of specific themes to discuss which will enable us to better understand the changes which French women have faced during this century.

      FR613 - The Reader and the Text

      
      
       This module aims to examine literature from an unusual angle by concentrating on the importance of the figure of the reader for the interpretation of novels.  Often novels address the reader directly; some novels are written in the second person, as if the reader were a central character.  Sometimes novels involve self-reflexive or self-referential elements that force the reader to reflect on his/her own expectations of literature.  When novels invoke the reader in these various ways, they invite us to reflect on the text  how it comes to exist, who it is for, what is its message or purpose  in new and challenging ways.  The module also concentrates on the 'nouveau roman', which involves sustained reflection on these and related questions.

      FR561 - Contemporary French Cinema

      
      
       This module examines some of the key works of French cinema since 1990. The films in this module will be studied in terms of their cultural background and within the context of French cinema history. While all the films are studied in close detail, students will be invited to develop important themes such as race and national identity, changing perceptions of Paris and the banlieue, and symptoms of social crisis. The aim of the module is to show how French filmmakers have had to invent new forms and styles of film in order to be able to address the specific issues raised by life in contemporary France.

      FR645 - Desire in the Text: Romanticism to Decadence

      
      
       This module presents a broadly chronological survey of canonical works of French literature of the nineteenth century centred on the theme of desire. More specifically, these works explore contemporary codes of love and marriage, shifting gender identities, capitalism, consumerism, moral, social and sexual transgression, alienation, lethargy, and death. The module takes fiction of the Romantic era as its starting point, exploring the frustration of desire associated with the mal du si&egrave;cle (the disillusionment and melancholy experienced by (primarily) young adults in the early nineteenth century). It concludes with naturalist and decadent works of the fin de si&egrave;cle, which are concerned with a discrepancy between desire and a generalised depletion of the energy required to fulfil it. The module identifies desire (whether satisfied, unfulfilled or conspicuously absent) as a central preoccupation in French cultural production of the nineteenth century. It also examines the extent to which desire is a strategy for expressing contemporary concerns and anxieties around specific aspects of modern life with which the human subject was coming rapidly and problematically to terms.

      FR646 - Crossing Borders: Travel in Modern French Writing

      
      
       This module will explore the evolution of the notion of travel in modern French thought and literature by looking at a wide range of French travel writing in prose as well as poetry, essays, and travel diaries from the late 19th century to the late 20th century.The objective is to show how travel writing questions the relevance of myths about travel itself (often seen as a means to discover new worlds and to allow different cultures to blend together) or about the other and otherworldliness.The module takes Arthur de Gobineaus and Victor Hugo's fictional travels to the East as a starting point to explore how 19th-century orientalism fed an imaginary, idealised or demonised conception of the other. From there we will move on to different (post)modern texts by Victor Segalen, Henri Michaux and Nicolas Bouvier, demonstrating how travel and writing can work together to cross borders of a cultural but also linguistic and stylistic nature.More specifically, these different works explore themes such as exoticism, (post)modern conceptions of intercultural relationships, opacity, loneliness, fragmentation, and chaotic trajectories.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
