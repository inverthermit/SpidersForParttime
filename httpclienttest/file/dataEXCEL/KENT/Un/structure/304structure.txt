 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      SO333 - Crime and Society

      
      
       This module provides first year students with a general introduction to the various ways in which cultural dynamics intertwine with the practices of crime and crime control within contemporary society.  To that end, the course will contain lectures on subjects such as crime and everyday life, "reality" crime tv, surveillance and the culture of control, and police culture and the politics of crime control.  The module will also seek to introduce students to other essential areas of criminological interest (such as the critical analysis of criminological theory, and criminological methods) via innovative teaching techniques involving staff debates and the close textual reading/analysis of contemporary crime news stories.  In addition, this module provides a space to embed key generic social science skills (in the form of three lecture-seminar slots)

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SO305 - Introduction to Criminology

      
      
       Crime is a major social and political issue and the source of much academic and popular debate.  Key criminological issues will be examined during the course of the module within their wider sociological and social policy context.  There will be a particular focus on understanding the nature and extent of crime and victimisation, analysing public and media perceptions of crime, and exploring the relationship between key social divisions (age, gender and ethnicity) and patterns of offending and victimisation.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW313 - A Critical Introduction to Law

      
      
       The module will introduce students to critical legal techniques grounded in critical legal and social theory, feminist and queer theory, postcolonial theory and law and the humanities. Throughout the course, concepts are introduced through socio-legal and critical investigation of selected case studies - such as new pieces of legislation, emerging political campaigns and prominent litigation - ensuring that the course maintains a focus on law in action. Particular attention will be paid to developments in foreign jurisdictions and in the international arena. Accordingly, case studies will alter from year to year, and draw heavily on research projects on-going in the Law School. The course has a heavy focus on primary legal materials and core critical texts, but will also draw on film, museum artefacts, art and literature as appropriate.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LW315 - Introduction to Obligations

      
      
       This module introduces the law of obligations, which comprises the private law of duties and rights to which individuals and organisations are subject.  Traditionally, it includes the law of contract and tort (but not property). As well as introducing some of the content (which is covered more extensively in LW597 The Law of Obligations), a key focus is on the institution of the common law through which most of the law of obligations has emerged.  This aspect is especially explored through the case classes, which run alongside the lectures and seminars.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW316 - Foundations of Property

      
      
       Property is something we tend to presume we know about, and rarely examine as an idea or practice closely. Most often we use it to connote an object or thing, and presume that it has something to do with ownership of that object. It is so simple to say my property or this is mine. This module begins to unpack and examine the ideas and practices of property more closely: How are property claims constructed? What do we mean by ownership? What happens when a number of competing ownership claims in one object exist? When preparing for the module it will be useful to think about (and collect material on) current debates over contested ownership (or use) of property and resources: art collections or cultural artefacts, land or natural resources dispossessed, land squatted, etc. And why, in our jurisdiction in particular, has such a strong link been made between being a property owner (in this context a home-owner) and a good citizen.

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      LW592 - Public Law 2

      
      
       The module builds on the understanding of constitutional government developed in Public Law 1 to examine the changing nature of the state in new modes of governance and governmentality.  The focus is on the shift away from the vertical character of the relationship between state and citizen to a more diffuse mode of governing populations through expertise, techniques of management, and biopolitics. In recent times there has been a shift away from states governing through legislation as a mode of command and control. Legislation is increasingly understood as enabling administration and governance rather than as the definitive word on a social or political problem.  In some respects, this is a continuation of legislation as a mode of authorising the exercise of public power.  However, the nature of power deployed and regulated through legislation has changed.  Government through officials or agents directly responsible to Ministers or Parliament is increasingly replaced by quasi-government authorities  (QUANGOS) whose strength is technical expertise. While the administrative state as it has evolved in the last century views this shift as a new strength in public administration, the key weakness is that accountability in the exercise of public power is lacking.  What are the implications of these transformations for public law?  How has public law facilitated these developments? What are the socio-legal and critical legal responses to these developments? These are the central concerns of this module.  It thus offers a specialised and complementary extension of themes and issues introduced to students in Public Law 1 in Stage 1 of the LLB degree.  The administrative authorities that have emerged in the era of the new administrative law  post 1970s - lack the formality of liberal constitutional protections.  Consider the relative informality in the administration of ASBOS. Moreover, the traditional public/private divide has broken down -  e.g. the privatisation of prisons, private corporations providing public services such as nursing homes or transport. The absence of social consensus, or unitary sovereign power has meant that the governance of gambling, security, the environment, gender and sexuality, science and technology, are not phenomena that can be dealt with through traditional liberal concepts or constitutional mechanisms.  This module will examine how public law has been the site of social, political, and legal contestations regarding these issues.

      LW593 - European Union Law

      
      
       This 15 credit spring term undergraduate law module is designed to introduce law students to foundational legal principles of the European Union (EU). It will place particular emphasis on studying the role and impact of the judicial institution of the EU, namely the Court of Justice of the EU, in interpreting the scope and effects of Union law. This module builds on the knowledge that students acquire in Public Law 1 where they are provided with a basic introduction to the history of the EU, the main institutions of the EU and key constitutional issues arising from the supremacy of EU law. It will focus predominantly on certain aspects of EU law not addressed in Public 1, including the free movement rules underpinning the single market.

      LW598 - Equity and Trusts

      
      
       This module, normally taken in Stage 2, introduces the student to the main principles and doctrines of equity and trusts. It is designed to challenge the somewhat dull image of this area of law and to encourage a critical and imaginative understanding of the subject. The law of equity and trusts is contextualized within a historical, social and jurisprudential inquiry thereby providing a much wider range of possible interpretations of its development and application. What then becomes central to the modules approach is the complex interrelation of law with ethical, political, economic and jurisprudential considerations, and that between legal outcomes, pragmatic concerns and policy objectives. Drawing upon the students experience of the study of law, in particular that gained from Foundations of Property Law and Property Law, this module examines the trust both as a private legal institution (the trust in family and commercial settings) and a public one (the charitable trust), placing special emphasis on the management of the trust and the powers, duties and obligations of the trustee. Yet in departing from conventional approaches this module does not study equity merely in regards to its role as the original creator of the trust. Equity is instead acknowledged to be what it really is - a vital and fruitful component of the English legal system; a distinct form of legal interpretation possessing its own principles and method of legal reasoning, and comprising an original and continuing source of legal development in the sphere of remedies.

       The focus of the module is private property in English land: title by registration; squatting; owner-occupation; leases; covenants and land development. It builds on the Foundations of Property module to develop an in-depth understanding of English land law, its conception of property and its politics and effects. And it gives experience in how to advise clients on land law problems  and on how to avoid problems for clients.

      LW542 - Policing

      
      
       The police represent the clearest boundary between the citizen and the state - this module examines their origins and development and their current organisation as well as the evolution of the strategies of policing. It looks at their powers in relation to investigative and deployment techniques as well as issues of their accountability for their decisions and their actions. Underlying the module is an exploration of the role of policing within liberal democratic society.

      SO535 - Youth and Crime

      
      
       This module provides students with a sociological and criminological understanding of contemporary issues relating to young people, crime and deviance. More specifically, the module provides a critical understanding of young peoples involvement in crime and deviance and the various responses to youth crime, especially how young people are dealt with by the youth justice system. We begin by examining current trends in youth offending and explore media responses and then go on to look at the youth problem from an historical context. We will then go on to focus in depth on several substantive topics, including gangs and violent crime; drugs, alcohol and nightlife; young people, urban space and antisocial behaviour; and the youth justice system in England and Wales. Throughout the module, attention is given to the importance of understanding the connections of youth crime with race, class and gender and at the same time, engages with key theoretical ideas and debates that inform our understandings of youth crime. This unit provides an opportunity to engage with the most up-to-date debates in an area of great interest in contemporary society.

      SO594 - Terrorism and Modern Society

      
      
       Following the events of September 11 2001 public concerns surrounding the related threats associated with terrorism have inevitably deepened. This course provides a general introduction to terrorism and poses a series of questions that rarely feature in mainstream criminological and sociological discourse. Central elements of the course include an examination of the historical roots of terrorism; an analysis of threat posed by the various terrorist factions associated with the global Salafi jihad; the contextualization of terrorism within the context of late modernity; and an analysis of terrorism at the macro, meso, and micro levels

      SO605 - Crime , Media and Culture

      
      
       The module provides students with an understanding of the contested cultural meanings underpinning crime.  Too often criminology is satisfied taking definitions of criminality at face value, when really it means very different things to different people and in different contexts.  The module examines how media representations propagate particular perceptions of crime, criminality and justice.  It goes on to consider the manner in which those who 'offend' experience and interpret their own behaviour, which may be focused on the attainment of excitement or indeed on attaining their own conception of justice.  The module explores these contradictions in a world where crime, control and the media saturate everyday life.  In doing so it considers a diverse range of concepts; youth culture, hedonism, hate crime, risk taking, moral panics, the image, emotionality and consumerism.  We examine the nature of a late-modern society where criminality inspires great fear and resentment, whilst at the same time it provides imagery which is harnessed to produce entertainment and sell a range of consumer goods.  Students will become familiar with cutting edge research and theory in the fields of Cultural Criminology, Visual Criminology, and Media and Crime, placing issues such as music, photography, street gangs, extreme sports, newspapers and nights on the town in new and exciting contexts.

      SO710 - War, Atrocity and Genocide

      
      
       This is an interdisciplinary module on war, atrocity and genocide. Drawing on a range of sources from military history, social psychology, sociology, criminology, political ethics and political history, it is concerned to explore the following questions: What is war and why is it a matter of criminological and sociological interest? What are the defining experiences and emotions associated with war and genocide?  How is killing in war framed or constructed in the minds of those who kill? What is mass killing/genocide and how is it accomplished and facilitated in war? Why is rape used so widely as a weapon in conflict situations and what is its lasting impact? What is genocide and how should it best be understood? How are atrocities in war denied, excused or rationalized? The aim of the module is to provide a framework for thinking about (1) the phenomenology of killing in war; (2) the conditions which facilitate genocide and mass killing at the state and sub state level; and (3) the ways in which perpetrators of mass killing, their apologists and distant others contrive to deny, rationalize or legitimize mass killing/genocide

      LW543 - Clinical Option

      
      
       Students on this module must become members of the Kent Law Clinic, and work under Supervisors on live cases for clients of the Clinic under the supervision of solicitors, or other experienced legal practitioners working alongside them. All Supervisors are members of the academic staff at Kent Law School. Students will develop their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of English law and procedure, and some specific skills. Students are encouraged to view their clinical work as a means to an end  not just the acquisition of important legal skills but primarily a better understanding and critical analysis of law and of legal practice. The excellent opportunity which clinical work provides for active learning, and for studying the interface between theory and practice, is placed firmly in this context.Students are expected to undertake from the second week of Autumn term onwards until the end of the Spring term, under supervision, the conduct of at least two substantial cases (or the equivalent), involving proceedings in courts or tribunals or other legal forums, or projects on an area of law of  relevance to the objects of the Clinic. Students will normally work on cases rather than projects. A Supervisor will decide whether a student has undertaken two substantial cases (or the equivalent) for the purposes of this module.

      LW552 - European Legal Systems

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide a basic introduction to the common characteristics which underpin the European (continental) legal systems with the object of providing students (particularly those on all of the four year European degree programmes) with a foundation upon which they can develop a more substantial knowledge of a continental jurisdiction. It will aim to provide a general grounding in the history, culture and mentality of the European legal systems and as such will focus upon the historical foundations, the institutional development and the methodological traditions. The starting point and foundation of the module will be the university tradition stemming from the rediscovery of Roman law in the 11th century and the development and transformation of this tradition over the subsequent centuries into the perceived axiomatic structure at one time thought to underpin the codes. Particular attention will be given to the French and German systems and contemporary developments within these systems will form the final part of the module.

      LW556 - Intellectual Property Law

      
      
       This module will examine the main forms or types of intellectual property (IP) rights: copyright, patents and trade marks (as well as the related topics of passing off and breach of confidence) that embody the notion of privatising the intangible fruits of the mind. About each of these IP forms, we will ask: what are the procedural requirements required for its creation as IP? Who is the owner of the IP and why is he/she the owner? What are the various rights given to the rights-holder? What constitutes IP infringement? What are the remedies available for IP infringement? But this is not an exclusively doctrinal module and we will continually look at pressing policy questions such as: why should we protect IP? How important is continuing access to the public domain? Should plants be the subject of a patent? Do employees get short-changed by the presumptions of IP law? Particular topics will vary from year to year, but may include copyright issues on the Internet, the impact of patents and copyright on socio-economic development in the global South, and questions such as: should musical parodies be permitted? Who benefits from IP? Should human genes be patentable? Should greater protection be given to whistleblowers? The focus will be on UK IP law, but we will regularly examine relevant EU directives and global IP treaties. The aim is not to provide a crash course in all aspects of intellectual property doctrine, but rather to examine a range of important practical and theoretical questions about a form of property that some commentators have called "the new wealth" of the 21st century.

      LW570 - Law and Social Change

      
      
       This module aims to investigate the relationship between law, morality, and social change, and how this relationship has changed and may change over time.  In other words, it seeks responses to questions such as the following: How does law produce morality and morality produce law? What is the role of moral norms and obligation in legal practice? How does the character of law shift in response to social struggle? Why, if some modern social theories allow for the recognition of a vastly reduced number of valid norms, is moral discourse still the default mechanism for resolving conflicts in society? Has moral discourse been supplanted by other means of conflict resolution and social integration? How might we envision an ideal moral-legal framework?Typically its content will include: The meanings of law and social changeClassical Social Theory, law and Social ChangeContemporary social theory, law and social changeThe Hart/Devlin Debate: Law, Disgust, and Social ChangePositive approaches to the promotion of Social Change Feminism and Legal ReformThe Legal Profession and Social ChangeRights and citizenship

      LW571 - Law and Society: Regulating Communities

      
      
       This module focuses on governance, regulation, norm-maintenance and rule non-compliance within communities and institutions. It provides a distinct perspective to general questions of law, socio-legal theory, and jurisprudence. Key questions include: when do norms count as law? How do communities govern themselves, and what role do law and social norms play in this process? What authority do intentional communities possess when it comes to rule-breaking? What is the relationship between community rules and state law? Can communities function without rules? And is institutional law-breaking (or non-compliance) analogous to individual disobedience? Topics include: legal pluralism and legal consciousness, Foucault and governmentality, norm-following among strangers, etiquette within public sex communities, virtual worlds, governing through local currencies, nudism, self-regulation in a free school, and Speakers Corner.

      LW578 - Law and Political Theory

      
      
       This module will examine contemporary political and juridical problems by drawing on political theory in relation to sovereignty, law, and violence.  For instance, the notion of sovereignty is central to what is regarded as legitimate and illegitimate violence.  What is the difference, in political and juridical terms, between a young soldier who sacrifices her/his life for the nation and a suicide bomber whose death and dying also has a political agenda? How can institutional and legalised violence such as colonialism or apartheid be dealt with by individuals and social orders? Classical and contemporary political theory can help us to address such questions.  It will thus examine concepts and theories of sovereignty, community, and the individual subject.  Key texts of modern political theory, such as the writings of Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Schmitt will be considered. Contemporary theorists such as Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, Talal Asad, and Veena Das will also be examined. The module will also draw on novels and film to explore the relationship between freedom and violence, suffering and memory, The examination of Case Studies will give students the opportunity to examine and understand the significance of political theory for dealing with contemporary legal issues and problems such as: terrorism, refugees, postcolonial law, war on terror, sovereignty in the EU, and Empire.

      LW580 - Consumer Law

      
      
       Consumer law and policy is a significant area of current UK and European Union market regulation. This module initially discusses the rationales for consumer law and the different forms of regulating consumer markets. We then look at topics such as deceptive and unfair advertising, standard form consumer contracts, consumer credit law, quality standards in the supply of goods and services, product safety, consumer redress and access to justice. Consumer law cuts across traditional doctrinal boundaries of private and public law and provides an opportunity for analysing a variety of forms of regulation such as private law, public regulation and enforcement, co-regulation, soft law, shaping market values, and harnessing market incentives.

      LW581 - Law and Literature

      
      
       So much of law is about text and the manipulation of language: Becoming sensitive to the construction of narratives in judgements, learning to read argument in its many forms, recognising the ways in which words, and patterns of words, can be used to create effect, playing with ambiguities or seeking to express an idea with clarity, all these are fundamental skills for a lawyer. Law is also about performance, the roles which are assigned to us and the drama of the court room. And law, as text and performance, carries fundamental cultural messages about the society we live in and the values we aspire to. During this module, we will examine some of the many ways in which reading, viewing and listening to, the arts helps us to think more concisely as well as more imaginatively about law. Our preliminary reading list is longer than usual, it is designed to give prospective students a taste of the range of material we will cover, as well as to suggest that it will be helpful to have undertaken some preliminary work before starting the module. We welcome on to the module anyone who shares, with us, an enjoyment of reading, viewing and listening  this is a chance to be introduced to material you may not be familiar with as well as a chance to pursue an interest you may already have. Although the module is designed primarily for law students, it is also open to undergraduates from other degree programmes.

       The media is full of gender controversies: theres same-sex marriage (or not) in California, violence against women pretty well everywhere, and a whopping 17% gender pay gap in the UK. What do you think about these issues? How do you think the law should respond? This module focuses on how law interacts with gender and sexuality. It examines, and encourages you to discuss, the interconnections between law, policy, gender, and sexuality. We will start by focusing on key concepts in feminist and queer legal theory, such as heteronormativity (the dominance of heterosexual family and social structures).  We will then relate these theories to current dilemmas: same-sex marriage; transgender rights; gay refugees; diverse family formations. Finally, we tackle the really big questions. Should we use the law to change the law? Are rights really any use? What is neo-liberalism and how does this relate to gender?

      LW583 - Art Law

      
      
       This module studies the development of Art law which has been shaped by a complex relationship between artists, dealers, auction houses, collectors, museums and the State. It has emerged from civil law, property law, criminal law, public law, private international law and public international law. It is regulated by a superposition of international treaties, European texts and national laws. Those different interactions have developed a less than coherent Art Law framework that will be comparatively analysed by reference to English, European and International Law. Topics to be discussed are (1) the definition of art in relation to law, cultural property, copyright and pornography (2) the actors of the market: the artist (his rights on the work of art, his freedom of creation and its limits), the dealers (dealers and auction houses), the expert and the collector (3) the sale of works of art: authenticity and counterfeit art, transfer of ownership of stolen art (4) the illicit trade of works of art in time of war (looting, spoliation during World War II) and in time of peace: conflicting national/European/international rules on the restitution of illegally exported, excavated and/or stolen works of art (5) museums: the legal character and obligations, staff, de-accession and (6) the role of the State: a non-neutral actor in the protection and support of art and the artists.

       Please note: You do not need to have studied maths, science or probabilities to perform well on this module!Forensic evidence is a rapidly developing area in criminal trials  new techniques are continually being developed and forensic evidence such as DNA profiling is increasingly presented as evidence. This rapid expansion has resulted in forensic evidence becoming increasingly debated in the media and by the criminal justice process  from articles hailing DNA profiling as preventing or undoing miscarriages of justice to those questioning a lay jurys ability to make a judgement in case involving highly complex scientific or medical evidence. This module considers how the criminal justice system makes use of forensic science. Initially, analysis of the relevant rules of evidence will be made alongside a broad overview of forensic science in the courtroom.  This is then built upon through an exploration of case law and consideration of topical questions such as who should decide whether a new scientific technique should be admissible evidence, who are the experts who present the evidence to juries and the extent to which the admission of forensic evidence assists juries.

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

      LW586 - Environmental Law II

      
      
       Environmental Law II builds upon the themes introduced in Environmental Law I whilst placing central emphasis upon the environmental and ecological implications of land use and development, and the regulation of land use activities to secure protection of biodiversity. The module commences with some cross-cutting issues, encompassing civil liability for environmental harms and human rights in respect of the environment, before turning to consideration of regimes for restricting land use to prevent unacceptable kinds of environmental and ecological harm. This involves looking at land use development controls in national law and European Community requirements for environmental assessment of projects and plans to anticipate and mitigate the environmental impacts of development. This leads into a discussion of laws that are more specifically concerned with the protection of species and habitats, either through direct restrictions upon destructive activities or through legal mechanisms to secure biodiversity conservation through designation and management of land that is of ecological importance. In respect of each topic, the object is to place discussion of national and European Community laws into context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving environmentally and ecologically appropriate land use and conservation of biodiversity, and ultimately sustainable development.

      LW589 - The Skills of Argument - How to Argue and Win

      
      
       Argument occurs across the full spectrum of human interaction - in pubs, at home, in seminar classes, and in professional contexts such as those provided by law, science and medicine. However, despite the importance allotted to argument and the desire of those engaged in arguments to win them, little systematic attention is given to the nature of argument and the practical skills required to argue successfully, even though this information is readily available. The ambition of the module is to equip students with this knowledge base and skills, thereby enabling them to enter into argument more confidently and with a greater prospect of success.  The module divides into three parts, the first being a very brief historical and theoretical contextualisation of the topic. The second part of the module treats argument and arguing formally, by mapping the standard forms of argument and by developing the skill of picking out a bad argument from a good one, and by showing how to spot the set of common but typically unnoticed mistakes in ones own argument or in those of others. The third part of the module turns to the skills of rhetoric and persuasion, including examination of the ploys that are often used to give bad or weak arguments persuasive force. The themes of the module are illustrated throughout using real examples from law and elsewhere.

      LW520 - Company Law and Capitalism

      
      
       This module seeks not only to familiarise students with the basic concepts and structure of modern British company law, but also to provide them with a critical understanding of the nature and dynamics of modern capitalism and of the historical development of industrial organisation and the emergence of company law within it. In addition to a selection on modern company law, therefore, the module also traces the rise of the joint stock company in the nineteenth century and the emergence of company law in its wake. It moves on to trace the twentieth century rise of the modern multidivisional, multinational company and its impact on company law. In this context, it also considers the nature of the share and of shareholding, and the role of the Stock Market, and explores contemporary debates about corporate governance. Key aspects will include exploring the contractual relations between, on the one hand, the company and its agents and on the other hand, third parties who deal with the company, tracing the evolutionary changes from the Common Law to the modern predominantly statutory framework. It will also deal with aspects of corporate management and control, including directors duties, shareholders rights and the increasingly important issues pertaining to market abuse and how the law seeks to deal with such practices. Students are encouraged to familiarise themselves with current issues in the commercial world by reading the financial pages of the newspapers, as reference will frequently be made to current events to facilitate the learning process. The module will address a range of inter-related questions: How well suited is modern company law to the regulation of the large modern corporation? What do shareholders do? What does the Stock Market do? In whose interests are modern corporations run?  In whose interest should they be run? How do companies contract and what are the relationships between the organs of the company?

      LW522 - Comparative Law

      
      
       In the current context of globalization, postcolonialism and transnationalism, not to mention the Europeanization of laws, every law student in the UK will almost inevitably encounter foreign law in the course of his or her professional life. For one thing, the legislator shows itself more and more open to the influence of foreign legal ideas in the legislative process. Also, appellate judges increasingly refer to foreign law in the course of their opinions. Further, private parties often enter into legal arrangements, such as contracts or wills, presenting an international dimension. In sum, nowadays, foreign law is everywhere and cannot be circumvented. This module intends to provide law students with the necessary intellectual equipment allowing them to approach any foreign law (not only European laws) in a meaningful way. In particular, the module will heighten students sensitization to the specificity of foreign legal cultures and encourage them to reflect in depth upon the possibilities and limits of cross-border interaction in the law. Another feature of this module will be a critical introduction to hermeneutics, deconstruction and translation studies with specific reference being made to law as these lines of thought are most relevant for comparatists. Throughout the course, concrete examples will be developed from a range of different national laws. No prior knowledge of foreign law or of a foreign language is required.

      LW507 - Critical Legal Theory

      
      
       Are you interested in critical approaches to law? Critical Legal Theory can help! This module introduces you to major concepts, questions and perspectives that are important for a critical engagement with the problem of law in contemporary life. The modules first aim is to build your vocabulary of critical legal concepts, which will deepen your engagement with law and legal problems. What does it mean to be critical? How can law aim for justice? Is law still authoritative? What qualifies as a legal text in contemporary society? How can we use understandings of sovereignty, judgment or the nature of government to critically analyse contemporary law? In the second term, we will apply these critical legal perspectives to a range of contemporary problems and situations. Examples might include biotechnology, facebook and social media, theoretical questions in governance and regulation, political protest, films and other popular cultural forms, human rights, social equality, terrorism and counter-terrorism, torture, the casualized workforce, and the plight of the refugee. Contemporary critical legal theory comes in many varieties and draws on many disciplines, and this module introduces you to a range of major approaches. Students will be able to focus their research essay on any substantive or theoretical area.

      LW600 - Law, Science and Technology

      
      
       Science and technology play a significant part in the way law operates in contemporary states. This plays out at several levels: law is turned to in order regulate scientific and technological developments, and in so doing helps societies shape their futures; science and technologies are frequently used in providing the basis of legal decisions, and experts play an increasing part in decision-making, in courts and in governance. Both law and science, however, are complex social fields, and understanding their interaction requires careful theoretical and methodological tools. In this module, we interrogate some of these interactions, by exploring conceptual tools from several disciplines (including socio-legal studies, science and technology studies and anthropology), and applying them to particular case studies, including: the regulation of reproductive technologies; evidence in the courtroom; the governance of climate change; intellectual property and access to medicines; law and psychiatry; technological disasters and citizenship. This module is likely to be of interest to those students who particularly enjoyed LW592 Public Law II.

      LW604 - Morality and Law

      
      
       This course will give students the opportunity to explore the ways in which morality has been understood and theorised and then to trace the development of a particular moral concept (namely, that of individual rights), that is central to legal discourse today. The methodology will be historical/contextual as well as theoretical/analytical. We will look at the way in which the idea of individual rights arose (and continues to develop) in a philosophical, political and historical context and we will examine and critically evaluate modern theories of rights and their relationship to law. The concept of a right is deceptively simple. When examined closely is gives rise to all sorts of questions and problems including, for example: how is the idea of a right justified? What is its relationship to the older idea of liberty? Can it survive the discrediting of theories of natural rights tied to natural law? Can it stand alone as a moral concept or is it merely the other side of a duty?Block 1: A critical introduction to the major theories of moral philosophy: virtue theory, duty based (deontological) Kantian theory and consequentialism (utilitarianism). Block 2:. A historical/contextual examination of the development of a particular moral concept; that of individual rights. Block 3.Oral presentations by students in pairs.Block 4.An analytical examination and critique of modern theories of rights and their relationship to law (incl. interest and will theories and the legal analysis of Wesley Hohfeld)

      LW617 - Legal Ethics: Exploring the Ethics of Lawyersand Lawyering

      
      
       This course will give students the opportunity to explore the ways in which moral reasoning can inform the study and practice of lawyering.  Students will be asked to think and argue about the (possible) moral dimension of the practice of law. The course will include a theoretical component during which we will explore ways in which we might justify (or deny) a moral dimension to the practice of law. In the practical component we will use case studies (including that of the US government lawyers who provided legal justifications for the use of torture on War on Terror prisoners). This case study and others will be used to discuss and debate issues in legal ethics, broadly conceived. The methodology will combine theoretical discussion of the principles that should inform the notion of legal ethics with analysis and discussion of actual moral and ethical dilemmas faced by lawyers and their resolution.Block 1: Why Legal Ethics? An exploration of the moral reasoning and arguments behind the idea of legal ethics. Do lawyers have moral responsibilities as well as legal ones? Block 2: Case studies and the ethical issues they raise. Answers to moral questions and dilemmas in legal practice.

      LW626 - Appropriate Dispute Resolution: Theory and   Practice

      
      
       In recent times, alternative forms of dispute resolution (ADR) have been widely recognised as possessing the potential to limit some of the damage caused by civil disputes. Therefore, a lawyers skill-set ideally should include a well-developed ability to analyse, manage and resolve disputes both within and outside the usual setting of the courtroom. Thus, the modules primary aim is to introduce students to the legal and regulatory issues surrounding methods of dispute resolution aside from litigation. Specifically, the module focuses on the practical factors relevant to selecting appropriate dispute resolution in distinct circumstances, including, for example, the employment and family law arenas.  Students will be provided with the resources to acquire a detailed theoretical and practical understanding of the contextual constraints associated with the use of different forms of dispute resolution and will be encouraged to develop their ability to evaluate the effectiveness of particular interventions, especially when used as an adjunct to court proceedings. The module tracks historic and current developments in relation the use of ADR, highlighting how government policy and courts appear, increasingly, to sanction failure to use ADR. This may well enhance students opportunities to hone career-advancing expertise in the field.
