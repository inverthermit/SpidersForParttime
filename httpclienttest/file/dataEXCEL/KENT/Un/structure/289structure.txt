  Year abroad

  
   You spend a year in the USA, Canada or Hong Kong between Stages 2 and 4, studying equivalent courses to those you take at Kent. Our partner universities include Indiana University in Bloomington, several campuses of the University of California, Trent and Calgary Universities in Canada and the City University Hong Kong. If you take this course, you pay a reduced fee to Kent during your year abroad. You do not need to pay fees at the host university.

  


     
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PH790 - Year Abroad

      
      
       PH790 needs to cover a majority of learning outcomes in Stage 3 of the parent MPhys programme.  The modules in the university abroad should normally cover similar topics at a similar level.  Note that a one-to-one correspondence is not feasible and would negate the purpose of the Year Abroad, which is to provide the student with the experience of the educational system abroad.  In addition, the student has the opportunity to study some modules which are not available at University of Kent.With regards to topics, the academic liaison (typically DoUGS Physics) will check and approve the students choice of modules at the time they are at the university abroad. 

       Credits: 120 credits (60 ECTS credits).

Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PH700 - Physics Research Project

      
      
       Aims: 
To provide an experience of open-ended research work.
To begin to prepare students for postgraduate work towards degrees by research or for careers in R&D in industrial or government/national laboratories.
To deepen knowledge in a specialised field and be able to communicate that knowledge orally and in writing.SyllabusAll MPhys students undertake a laboratory, theoretical or computationally-based project related to their degree specialism. These projects may also be undertaken by Diploma students. A list of available project areas is made available during Stage 3, but may be augmented/revised at any time up to and including Week 1 of Stage 4. As far as possible, projects will be assigned on the basis of students' preferences  but this is not always possible: however, the project abstracts are regarded as 'flexible' in the sense that significant modification is possible (subject only to mutual consent between student and supervisor). The projects involve a combination of some or all of: literature search and critique, laboratory work, theoretical work, computational physics and data reduction/analysis. The majority of the projects are directly related to the research conducted in the department and are undertaken within the various SPS research teams.
