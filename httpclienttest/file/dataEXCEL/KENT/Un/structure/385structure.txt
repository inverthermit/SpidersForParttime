Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      FA309 - Creative and Critical Practice 1

      
      
       This module introduces students to the disciplines of studio practice. Creative and Critical Practice 1 aims to support students in identifying key interests that will develop into a sustainable art practice. The emphasis will be on giving the student the tools to find and define their own brief and challenge their own assumptions by introducing them to a broad range of possibilities, debates and ideas. This approach is contextualized by reference to key terms in fine art and the development of analytical skills: students engage with conceptual strands through their own developing intellectual and practical skill base. This discursive student centred teaching gives students knowledge of contemporary artists and their contexts, therefore providing an informed and contextualised grounding to the skills of self directed practice and research that they will develop later in their studies.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FA310 - Creative and Critical Practice 2

      
      
       This module develops the students ongoing engagement with studio practice. Creative and Critical Practice 2 aims to support students in building on and developing the key interests that they identified in Creative and Critical Practice 1. Students are required to refine their interests through self-initiated practice. The emphasis will be in giving the students the tools to define and improve their brief and to continue to challenge their own assumptions by introducing them to a broad range of possibilities, debates and ideas. This approach is contextualized by reference to key terms in fine art and the development of analytical skills: students engage with conceptual strands through their own developing intellectual and practical skill base. This discursive student centred teaching gives students knowledge of contemporary artists and their contexts, therefore providing an informed and contextualised grounding to the skills of self directed practice and research that they will develop later in their studies.

      FA312 - The Shock of the Now: Themes in Contemporary Art

      
      
       This course aims to draw on both the history and theory of art in order to present a wide range of contemporary forms of art and artistic practice, and to articulate some key distinctions useful for addressing the question of the place of art in culture. In particular, a discussion of ideas of the avant-garde, of modernity and postmodernism will be relevant here. The course will explore, through pursuing general themes and case studies of particularly controversial art objects, the different means by which our notions of art and of the artist are 'framed' today, and it will therefore both inform students' broader study of the history of art and complement their individual artistic practice. Students undertaking this module will complete a final essay (see 16 below) requiring an in depth investigation and evaluation of a particular topic or theme in contemporary art.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FA502 - Practice in Context 1

      
      
       This module will provide an integrated approach to fine art practice and critical studies. Practice In Context 1 gives students the opportunity to refine their practice by working through and analysing the relationship between form, content and process. In this module students will gain a developed and working understanding of the difference between intentionality and reception in the production of art. The Module thus aims to develop: 1) an awareness of the contexts that art practice situates itself within and those that inform it; and, 2) independently motivated practice.

      FA508 - Practice in Context 2

      
      
       This module will provide an integrated approach to fine art practice and critical studies. Building on Practice In Context 1, Practice In Context 2 gives students the opportunity to further develop and extend their practice by beginning to master their analytical skills in relation to their developing art work and topics of independent research. In this module students will gain a developed understanding of the interdependence of theory and practice in the production of art.  Practice In Context 2 aims to give students a coherent grasp of: 1) the contexts that art practice situates itself within and those that inform it; and 2)  a structured and confident approach to independently motivated practice. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FA500 - Review and Response

      
      
       The module will provide an integrated approach to art practice and critical studies. The Module aims to develop: 1) an awareness of the contexts that art practice situates itself within and those that inform it; 2) independently motivated practice; and, 3) an awareness of the role of criticism, review style writing, artists books, catalogue publications and cultures of literature in the field. A Review and Response essay delivered as a form of professional publication, which deals with current exhibitions visited during the Module, will act as the final assessment point.  Arts literature workshops will analyse the peripheral material of art including press releases, invite cards, press packs, artists writing and art criticism. Students are encouraged to analyse and produce writing that takes up relevant imagery, aesthetic and publishing styles and to produce layouts for their writing on submission, which can use the form of blogs, scripts, academic review, and/or creative writing.

      FA507 - Place and Site

      
      
       This module provides an opportunity for students to extend and apply practice and process outside conventional exhibition spaces, and to explore alternative contexts and environments. It allows students to develop speculative, experimental ways of working and possible outcomes, which respond to a diversity of contexts and audiences.Individually, or in groups, students will identify and define a site through which to produce a visual and conceptual enquiry that may lead to a piece of work or enable work to be made. Students will be introduced to the debates and theories around associated contemporary practice including site specificity, the temporary, public engagement, (non-specialist) audiences, funding, and education. Students will learn important strategies for investigation through contextual analysis and develop skills in presentation, planning, communication, negotiation, compiling proposals and team work. The theme and context of enquiry will be negotiated with tutors and may be designed for one of a number of purposes, depending upon developing interests.

  Year in industry

  
   By taking this option, you benefit from increased confidence and experience when entering the working world. A year in industry also gives you the opportunity to increase your contacts and network so that you can hit the ground running when you graduate. It is taken in addition to your undergraduate programme and normally falls between your second and final year. If taken, the year itself is assessed on a pass/fail basis through employer feedback and a written report that you submit.

Students usually work on placement for the entire calendar year. Salary and holiday entitlements vary according to your employer. However, many students find that they earn enough to be able to save some income, and this often helps them in returning to study.

A work placement provides practical experience that can be put to good use in your study. It gives you a sense of how the theory works in practice and improves your skills in many areas. It also allows you to evaluate a particular career path, and gain knowledge of the working environment.
