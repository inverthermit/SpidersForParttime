 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CL329 - Introduction to Archaeology

      
      
       The module will introduce archaeology as an academic discipline, providing grounding in basic concepts and methodology and techniques of analysis relating to archaeological evidence. It will provide background relevant to other archaeological and historical modules through examining aspects of the archaeological process in prehistoric, Roman and medieval contexts. It will enable students to make an informed choice of subsequent modules. Topics will include basic fieldwork methods and techniques, and an introduction to key topics in interpretation, such as society and culture, ritual and religion, technology, etc. through case studies e.g . of Pompeii, Sutton Hoo, and the Ice Man.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CL353 - The Civilisations of Greece and Rome

      
      
       In the Autumn term we start with Greece. The history will centre on Athens in the 5th century B.C. We begin with Solons reforms, then after considering the period of the Persian invasions we study the developed democracy with its empire under Pericles and its destruction in the Peloponnesian War. After 5 weeks, we move to the literature of the period, more specifically, the development of tragedy and comedy in fifth-century Athens, examining staging and dramatic conventions such as the role of actor, chorus and religious function and plot, especially the handling of mythological themes. We will analyse a selection of major plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Within this framework the module explores the role of tragedy and comedy as vehicles for public debate in the democracy, and its treatment of justice, religion, rationalism and patriotic themes.In the Spring term, we move to Rome. In the Roman part of the course we shall treat the last century of the republic. Our focus will be on how that republic fell and was replaced by the empire whose founder was Augustus. Among the themes examined will be political violence, the intrusion of the army into political life and the rise of the warlord. In the literature part of the Spring term the module is concerned with the patronage of the arts (poetry, history writing, art and architecture) under Augustus, with the role of the arts as propaganda, and the thesis that writers were recruited to act as spokesmen for the policies and ideals of the principate. The central theme is the creation of enduring images of Rome and Empire, using traditional historical and mythological materials; alongside this the module treats areas of public policy such as moral legislation, festivals, religious reform and the position of women.  The module is also concerned with the responses of the writers, whether as supporters of public policy, or as commenting on and reacting against it. Thus, its content is much better understood as a result of the historical development outlined in the first part of term.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      IT312 - History of Italian Cinema:The Legacy of Neo-Realism

      
      
       This course will introduce the students to the work of some of the major Italian filmmakers who contributed to Neorealism's aesthetics and contents (Rossellini, De Sica, De Santis, Fellini) and those who have been inspired by them from the Fifties to the present. Through the study of the history of Italian cinema, students will become familiar with some of the most relevant issues of the history of Italian culture and society. The course will focus particularly on some periods of the history of both Italian cinema and Italian society:- The 1940s: Neorealism as a rejection of the fascist film industry ('Telefoni bianchi/White Telephones' and 'Calligrafi/Calligraphers') and as a way of representing Italian society in the years between the fall of fascism and the birth of the Italian Republic. - The legacy of Neorealism in the Fifties: Fellini - the decline of Neorealism into the so-called Pink Neorealism during the years of 'Ricostruzione (Reconstruction) and the Cold War- The legacy of Neorealism and its influence on Hollywood mainstream industry (with special focus on gangster films)- The legacy of Neorealism on contemporary Italian cinema (e.g. Moretti, Sorrentino, Garrone).

      IT508 - Learning Italian 2 (Intermediate)

      
      
       This module has been planned as the natural follow-on for those who have recently, successfully taken a beginners Italian course such as IT301, and who should have covered the basics of grammar, acquired a stock of high frequency vocabulary and reached a degree of proficiency beyond GCSE and approaching A-level. (A2-B1 in terms of the Common European Framework of Reference {CEFR}).At the same time the course is designed to prepare students for their third year studies and exams in Italy. IT508, like IT301, is an intensive course which requires serious commitment.

      IT552 - Italian Short Story

      
      
       This module focuses on a number of Italian contemporary short stories. More specifically, it discusses the literary treatment of love, and the love story, in the short stories of some of the most important Italian writers of the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century. Works by worldwide renowned authors such as Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese and Leonardo Sciascia, accomplished "postmodernist" writers belonging to a younger generation such as Antonio Tabucchi and Pier Vittorio Tondelli, as well as less celebrated authors such as Gianni Celati, Erri De Luca and Fabrizia Ramondino will be taken into consideration. While not underestimating the profound economic, social and political changes that Italy underwent during the last sixty years, particular emphasis will be given to the similar way in which all these writers seem to fictionally conceive of the love relationship as a missed encounter. In spite of the manifold forms of love being described in these texts (between husband and wife; wife and lover; young boy and ideal father; sister and brother; mother and daughter; two young men, etc.), all the short stories chronologically analysed in this module seem to rely on Calvino's provoking suggestion according to which the missed encounter is the "fundamental element" of love relationships.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      IT556 - Catching the Tide: Cultural Renewal in 20th Century Italy

      
      
       Despite her incomparable heritage, Italy experienced for many centuries a sense of cultural provincialism, with the world's intellectual curiosity switching to Paris, London, New York and other centres of innovation. This module focuses on the clear connections between rapid socio-economic and socio-political change and the thrust for cultural modernity that made 20th century Italy once more a key contributor to the literary and visual arts in Europe and beyond. A wide variety of Italian "texts" of the first seventy years of the 20th century will be taken into consideration, including novels, plays, short stories and films.

      CL310 - Greek for Beginners

      
      
       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL652 - Gods, Heroes and Mystery Cults: Religion in  Ancient Greece

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL659 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world? This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

      CL663 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences. Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject. Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness. In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject. An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus. The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine. From here, the study will move into the Roman period. Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry. For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen. Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another. Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.

      CL665 - Constantinople and the Late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL666 - Foundations of Britain

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL677 - Fieldwork Practice

      
      
       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL685 - Torture and Sacrifice: the literature of early Christianity

      
      
       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity.  A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

      CL692 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

      CL700 - Museum Studies (with internship)

      
      
       The module will allow the student to acquire knowledge and critical understanding of the fundamental principles related to collecting and interpreting objects within museums and managing these institutions. .Students will be required to become familiar and engage critically, during the seminars, with the key references on these topics. Students will then be required to apply concepts and principles learnt in class in the context of their internship.. As part of their internship, each student will devise a special project in consultation with the mentor and the module convenor. Precise objectives and skills to be learnt will be recorded and tracked regularly. Students will keep a weekly log of their activities. The placement may take place either as a block during the Easter vacation of Stage 2 or 3, or at regular intervals over the Autumn and Spring terms.

       This module examines, in detail, Greek history from the end of the Persian invasions to the fall of Athens in 404 BC. The main themes of the module are the rise and fall of the power of Athens, the Peloponnesian War and the role of the Persian Empire in Greek history in the 5th century BC. Particular attention will be paid to the causes of the conflict between Athens and Sparta and to the political and military history of the last three decades of the 5th century BC.

      CL708 - Greek Philosophy: Plato and Aristotle

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to some of the major works in ancient Greek philosophy in relation to ethics, aesthetics, political theory, ontology and metaphysics. Students will study substantial portions of primary texts by the Pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle. The emphasis throughout will be on the philosophical significance of the ideas studied. The module will concentrate on understanding key philosophical arguments and concepts within the context of the ancient Greek intellectual tradition. This means that students will gain a critical distance from normative and modern definitions of philosophical terms in order to understand how Greek philosophy generally approached questions and problems with different suppositions and conceptions of reality, reason and the purpose of human existence.

      CL713 - Athenian Power Plays

      
      
       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      CL691 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL604 - Roman and Medieval Artefacts

      
      
       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL607 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences.  Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject.  Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness.  In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject.  An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus.  The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine.  From here, the study will move into the Roman period.  Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry.  For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen.  Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another.  Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       The module is based on individual scholarship and research supplemented by group guidance seminars and one-to-one supervisions.The project will be chosen by the student with the advice of the tutor. In terms of  the primary data it could involve investigation of antiquarian literature; archive documentation including cartographic sources; Sites and Monuments Records; museum collections; observation of monuments in the field; or participation in approved field work or excavation. Engagement with some types of primary data may be recorded in the form of a log which can appropriately be included as a component of the final report on the project. Choice of project will be informed by personal interests, the fulfilment of the aims of the module, the availability of expert supervision, and the accessibility of data. Typically the project may have a local or regional focus.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL639 - Constantinople and the late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

      CL590 - The Foundations of Britain: Archaeology of the first Millenium B.C.

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL591 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world?  This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

      CL504 - Classical & Archaeological Studies Dissertation

      
      
       This module is intended to introduce undergraduate students to research. As such it provides an opportunity to work on a topic of their own choosing, in either archaeology, history or ancient literature. Originality and feasibility are important aspects of writing dissertations, and to avoid problems topics will be scrutinised and approved by CLAS before research can begin. Students can expect guidance from the module convenor and an academic supervisor throughout the process, varying from one-to-one tutorials to classes on how to edit your own prose. There will also be a meeting regarding the Dissertation at the end of the Spring term of the previous year to clarify arrangements and to outline what work is required on this module.The programme document with regulations is sent to all students at the end of spring term of Stage 2. Students are invited to suggest titles for comment, for which tutors are allocated. They are advised to do preliminary reading over the summer based on generic advice of the module convenor. They then choose precise topics in consultation with the convenor and personal tutors at the start of the autumn term. This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

       The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act to some extent in the role of a teaching assistant, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a language topic or talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly online journal. Some travel may be required by students taking this module.  In this instance, it should be noted that the University is unable to cover the cost of any such journey.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      IT548 - Italian Cinema and Literature

      
      
       This module discusses contemporary film adaptations (1990s-2000s) taken from four different Italian textual sources (childrens tale, monologue, novel and non-fiction) under the following main aspects: 1.   as "parallel" works which supplement the original literary texts. Films expand, update and adjust the themes of the original literary texts to the historical, social and cultural context in which the adaptations are made. 2.   as works of literary criticism. The way the narrative of a film adaptation is structured and the way a film chooses to selectively focus on some particular episodes and themes is evidence of how the film director critically analyses the literary text and "re-writes" it in the form of a screenplay and in the editing of the material filmed;3.   as an altogether "new" product that structurally differs from the original literary source. Cinema's language relies on signifying images or visual signs that are irreducible to those of written and spoken languages;4.   finally, we will analyse the impact that filmmaking had on the art of writing, assessing the extent to which contemporary novels are often already written with the big screen in mind. We will focus on four emblematic contemporary adaptations: Collodis Pinocchio, adapted by Roberto Benigni, Bariccos Novecento (a monologue), adapted by Tornatore (La leggenda del pianist sulloceano), Ammanitis Io non ho paura, adapted by Gabriele Salvatores, and finally Savianos Gomorra, adapted by Matteo Garrone.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      IT564 - Istantanea: Photography and Visual Culture in Modern and Contemporary I

      
      
       This module aims at developing students visual literacy within the context of Italian studies, by teaching the skills necessary for the reading of static visual materials, especially photography. Contextually, it aims at developing and enhancing the critical response of students to such imagery, with particular focus on their social, cultural and political context. Photography worldwide has been at the centre of daily life, artistic production and political propaganda for the last century and a half. This holds all the more true for Italy, whose contemporary history as a unified country begins almost at the same time as the popularisation of photography. This module will explore this relationship on a socio-historical basis: It will analyse, among other topics, the portrayal of the Risorgimento; Lombrosos criminological and anthropometric use of photography; pseudo-anthropological photography in colonialist exploits, racism and eugenics; Fascist propaganda; futurism and modernism; neo-realist documentary photography and its influence on photojournalism of the 1960s-70s; the paparazzi, fashion and advertisement; photography and the contemporary visual arts; digital photography and social networks. By means of a close reading of photographic and other visual materials, the students will gain a profound understanding of the practicesideological, political, commercial, aesthetic, socialthat produce such materials within the modern Italian cultural context. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
