      MA501 - Statistics for Insurance

      
      
       This module covers aspects of Statistics which are particularly relevant to insurance. Some topics (such as risk theory and credibility theory) have been developed specifically for actuarial use. Other areas (such as Bayesian Statistics) have been developed in other contexts but now find applications in actuarial fields. Stochastic processes of events such as accidents, together with the financial flow of their payouts underpin much of the work.  Since the earliest games of chance, the probability of ruin has been a topic of interest.  Outline Syllabus includes: Decision Theory; Bayesian Statistics; Loss Distributions; Reinsurance; Credibility Theory; Empirical Bayes Credibility theory; Risk Models; Ruin Theory; Generalised Linear Models; Run-off Triangles.Marks on this module can count towards examption from the professional examination CT6 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

      MA529 - Probability and Statistics for Actuarial Science 2

      
      
       This module develops the techniques introduced in MA319. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations. The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module. Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing. All of these have been introduced in MA319. The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation. Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, cumulant generating functions etc. The Poisson process. Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables. Random number simulation. Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution. Principles of statistical inference. Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency). Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments. Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test. Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.  Statistical inference for the slope and intercept parameters in simple linear regression.  One-way ANOVA.Marks on this module can count towards examption from the professional examination CT3 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
