  Year in industry

  
   The School of Arts &lsquo;Year in Industry'  module is an opportunity for students to take &lsquo;a year out&rsquo; to gain experience of the workplace. We have long recognised the benefits of students taking a year out in the workplace, where the relevance of the subjects taken is as important as the experience itself, and the benefits to the student of increasing awareness and confidence are emphasised. It also gives students an opportunity to increase their contacts and network to let them hit the ground running when they graduate. The year itself will be pass/fail and is assessed through employer feedback and a submitted report from you that is marked. The year will offer reduced fees, is flexible in its approach and need not be specifically aligned to your subject of study.
