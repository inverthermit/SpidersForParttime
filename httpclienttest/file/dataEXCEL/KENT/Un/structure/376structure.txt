 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EL305 - Introduction to Electronics

      
      
       Electronics hardware consists of various components and devices interconnected in such a way that they perform the required functions. This module introduces students to main electric components (i.e. resistors, capacitors, inductors, and voltage and current sources) and to operational amplifiers, which are the basic building blocks of many circuits; how do they work and what properties do they have; what are their main usages in circuits and systems; and how to practically perform simple measurements and tests. Also, fundamentals of analysis of electric circuits and the main circuit laws are taught. The teaching of this module makes an extensive use of a computer-aided electronic circuit design tools to assist in and to amplify traditional lecture-based learning. It also includes a mini-project in which students gain practical laboratory experience, including design, physical construction and testing of an example operational amplifier circuit. The module requires some elementary mathematical skills.

      EL561 - Image Analysis & Applications

      
      
       Intelligent processing is associated with information processing operations which are generally carried out reliably and efficiently by humans, but which may be much more challenging for computer-based processing systems.  This module will introduce and explore some important techniques and applications for automated intelligent processing.  Principally, it will explore the visual environment, which is so important in human activity and increasingly so in supporting computational processing platforms routinely encountered in the modern world.  The display, manipulation and efficient communication of images (embracing issues ranging from how to manipulate image data to provide an optimal visual experience, to the automatic extraction of information from images to understand their content) are key elements in the design and utilisation of many contemporary applications in digital media and in engineering.This module will introduce the basic techniques required for image processing and automated image analysis, and will include a introductory study of the use of so-called neural network processors for the analysis of images, especially in relation to problems of image recognition, since such architectures neatly bridge the areas of human and automated processing.  Similarly, the module will embrace important topics of increasing interest in the context of maintaining the security of systems and media, including particularly an introduction to the emerging field of biometrics (the automatic identification of individuals).  Biometrics provides a good domain within which the power of intelligent processing can be illustrated, both because the identification of individuals is a fundamental human capability, and is increasingly important in many media applications (especially in relation to system security), but also because this often relies directly on the effective processing of visual data and complex images.

The connection between continuous and discrete time signals is explained through the introduction of the sampling theorem. The course introduces basic concepts for describing signals and systems in the time and frequency domains including the Fourier Series, the Fourier Transform and the Laplace Transform before applying them to signal and system analysis. The use of feedback control is illustrated as a tool to tailor the response of engineering signals and systems. The course introduces tools for the analysis of control systems and these concepts are applied to introduce  the industry standard PID controller and design control strategies for simple electromechanical  systems. MATLAB is used in a series of laboratory workshops to illustrate the material covered in the lectures.
