      DI304 - Economic and Environmental Systems

      
      
       Economic growth and the environmental are intimately linked. With climate change threatening our current way of life and global biodiversity we need to understand the linkages between economic activity and the environment in order to avert catastrophic changes.  This module explains these links and possible solutions to climate change and other threats.  In Part 1, we consider the evolution of the earth and the environmental processes that determine past and present patterns of biodiversity. In Part II we look at how human-environment interactions and specifically consider the role of market forces in determining resource use and in the creation of environmental problems. In Part III we investigate contemporary environmental problems and explore possible solutions through various market and government mechanisms such as carbon trading, environmental taxation and new forms of consumerism.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI305 - Biodiversity

      
      
       This module will introduce a range of fundamental concepts that underpin our understanding of biodiversity and, therefore, the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The differences and similarities between the multiple definitions for the term biodiversity will be considered, in addition to examining how scientists are trying to assess the magnitude of biodiversity on the planet. Spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity will be investigated, along with the importance of biodiversity (both use and non-values). The module will then explore the contemporary threats to biodiversity and provision of associated ecosystem services, in conjunction with a broad overview of the methods conservationists employ to protect and maintain biodiversity. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

  Year in industry

  
   The year in professional practice  involves a minimum of 24 weeks spent on placement at one or more organisations whose work is relevant to your degree programme.

During the placement you will work under the direction of a designated line manager within the host organisation, with additional support from the University via a named member of academic staff.

You will be working on one or more tasks that are agreed in advance, for example, you may contribute to a management plan, a policy report, a consultation process, a piece of applied research, or development of a set of educational materials.
  


   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      DI522 - Research Project

      
      
       The module is considered as an important element of Wildlife Conservation undergraduate training.  The opportunity to engage in personal research is seen as an essential element of academic training in all disciplines.  The particular skills necessary to undertake research, whether practical fieldwork or laboratory work or a desk-based study, can only be taught through the medium of practically orientated investigative tasks.  The principle objective in the research project is to assist students in gaining insight into the organisation, analysis and communication of research.  The approved investigation may be novel i.e. one that has not previously been carried out, or it may repeat previously executed work for comparative or control purposes.   

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DI528 - Conservation Social Science: Methods and Research Design

      
      
       This module introduces students to social science methods and research design - an increasingly important area of expertise in conservation, both in academia and in professional practice.  Students will gain basic training and practical experience in the design and use of (a) qualitative interviews and (b) questionnaires.  Sessions will also be devoted to processing and analysis of qualitative data, and also basic descriptive statistics to analyse quantitative data, but not inferential statistics, since this is covered elsewhere in the BSc programme (DI508).  Towards the end of the module we will look in more depth at the principles of research design in order to help students begin to plan their final year research projects.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI533 - Professional Placements

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with the opportunity to spend a year (minimum 24 weeks) working in a professional environment, applying and enhancing the knowledge, skills and techniques that they have acquired in Stages 1 and 2 of their degree programme. This may be made up of a single placement of at least 24 weeks or of two or more shorter placements that together add up to at least 24 weeks. Individual placements will involve one or more defined roles or tasks; for example placements may involve contributing to, producing or carrying out (i) a piece of research; (ii) a management plan or other management tool; (iii) a policy report, a piece of law or policy or its implementation; (iv) an exercise related to the storage and systematisation of data sets; (v) facilitation, planning and coordination of a consultation process or an event (vi) development of educational, awareness-raising or advocacy materials or activities. The work they do is entirely under the direction of their line manager at each placement, but support is provided via a named member of academic staff within the School (the 'Placement coordinator' for each student). This support includes ensuring that the work they are being expected to do is such that they can meet the learning outcomes of the module.Participation in this module is dependent on students obtaining an appropriate placement or placements. It is also normally dependent on maintaining a clean disciplinary record during their registration on the degree programme up to the time of their placement, although these requirements may be waived in individual cases at the discretion of the module and programme convenors where we judge that there is a strong case for allowing the placement to go ahead. Students who do not meet these conditions will normally be required to transfer to the appropriate programme without a Year in Professional Practice.

       Credits: 120 credits (60 ECTS credits).

Possible modules may include: 


                     
      DI531 - Human Wildlife Conflict and Resource Competition

      
      
       Human-wildlife conflicts and resource competition imply costs on human social, economic or cultural life and on the ecological, social or cultural life of wildlife concerned, often to the detriment of conservation objectives and socio-economic realities. This module aims to introduce students to the magnitude and multidisciplinary dimensions of human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) and resource competition, and current approaches and challenges in mitigating and preventing HWC. We will explore how theoretical frameworks for approaching HWC are most often confined within disciplinary boundaries and how more holistic approaches can better equip conservationists and other professionals in dealing with the issue. Using a variety of teaching and learning methods, students will learn about issues involved in determining and analysing HWC, and planning, implementing and evaluating conflict mitigation or prevention schemes. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI532 - Creative Conservation

      
      
       Creative Conservation will engage students with a range of ways of thinking critically about conservation issues and their communication whilst developing their own creative practice and skills portfolio. The approach will seek to take a truly interdisciplinary approach, exploring these issues form a range of disciplinary perspectives and seeking syntheses and new imaginings in addressing them. Topics of focus will be chosen from amongst: History of place and the relationship with nature  esp. East Kent and the Blean Photography - and the use of the still image Video - as representation and a research tool Art and Conservation - craftwork, eco-regional design and natural resource utilisation The Wildlife Documentary - a critical deconstruction and analysis Conservation, Religion and Culture Campaigning for Conservation Conservation and Agriculture Literature and Storytelling Conservation and Cuisine - benefit or burden to the conservation mission? Performance Ethnography - a theoretical framework for action research in conservationIn each case the theoretical, as well as the applied practical aspects of the topic will form a core component of the learning and teaching.

      DI527 - Practical Guiding and Interpretation

      
      
       The purpose of this module is to provide students with both a theoretical and working knowledge and understanding of guiding and interpretation (where interpretation is seen as educational activity that aims to reveal meaning and relationships through the use of first hand experience and illustrative media, rather than simply communicating factual information). In offering a rigorous, academic understanding of the subject area, as well as engaging with basic background facts and issues the lectures will cover the theoretical context of each subtopic, whether this is for example, the historical development of guiding, the process of storytelling, or the nature of factual information. Seminars will address the theoretical and evidential background covered in the lectures, address questions and issues that arise, critically examine relevant literature, and consider the practical implications in relation to guiding and interpretation. They will also assess examples of guiding from other sites, discuss and inform students private study activities, and include visits to potential guiding sites on campus. Lectures and seminars will be complemented by student presentation exercises and practical guiding and critique sessions. The final assessment will be of a short guided tour of campus focussed on a specific subject/theme, plus a written descriptive and analytical report that sets this tour within the wider theoretical and research framework. Successful completion of the module will enhance prospects of employment and business set-up in conservation and related heritage tourism industriesTopics covered   What guiding and interpretation are + their history, development and importance The visitor experience  expectations, the visit event and outcomes Preliminary site surveys and information gathering  Improving presentation and interpretative skills Developing fact lists and interpretative materials  The nature of narrative and the narrative of nature  Guiding and interpretation in practice I Planning, risk assessment and customer care Guiding and interpretation in practice II

      DI501 - Climate Change and Conservation

      
      
       This module will inform students how climate has influenced the diversity of life on Earth, from past to present. The role that anthropogenic factors have played in contemporary climate change since the commencement of the industrial era will be examined in detail, in addition to considering their possible effect on future climatic scenarios. The impact of climate change on individual organisms, populations and communities will be investigated, with particular emphasis given to understanding how species are responding. Human impacts from and vulnerabilities to global warming will also be considered. The module will explore how conservation biologists are using particular interventions to ameliorate the most harmful and destabilising effects of climate change. From a more general perspective, the social, economic and political ways in which climate change can be mitigated will be assessed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI505 - Conceptual Frameworks in Conservation Science

      
      
       The aim of the module is to cover major overarching and current issues, such as understanding biodiversity in the fossil record, extinction rates and how they are calculated, and how many species are there and why it matters. By looking at these bigger picture issues conceptual thinking will be brought in; for example how using basic biological knowledge, we can estimate the number of species on Earth. In addition, there will be guest lectures, and discussion of current global issues that are making the press such as the results of major international conferences; past examples included the outcomes of the Copenhagen conference on climate change and the concept of 'Planetary Boundaries'.

      DI508 - Skills for Conservation Biologists (Field trip)

      
      
       The most important skill of a field biologist is to be able to correctly interpret the biological meaning of their data. This course is designed to introduce and re-affirm statistical concepts, and their correct use and relevance to field biologists. Throughout this taught module, emphasis will be placed on practical application of statistics as much as possible, and when and how they are applied. Since there is both a theoretical and practical component to this module, students should aim to link the theory presented in lectures with the practical sessions and field trip parts of the course. By the end of the module, students should have a knowledge of the underlying principles of biological statistics, be able to evaluate from a theoretical stand-point and in practise, statistical results, and have a sound appreciation of the benefits and limitations of different statistical techniques and their application to field biology.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI520 - Conservation and Communities

      
      
       The driving causes of biodiversity loss are not just ecological, but also political, economic and cultural, and conservationists need to acquire the knowledge and skills to address broader social contexts. This module aims to introduce students to cutting-edge debates about the place of local people in biodiversity conservation, and provide them with an overview of the essential role that the social sciences play in the analysis of environmental issues. Objectives of the module are to provide students with a broad conceptual understanding of the social context of conservation, and particularly of the importance of politics and economics; knowledge of the history of conservation approaches towards local communities; familiarity with key issues in the implementation of community conservation; and

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LW586 - Environmental Law II

      
      
       Environmental Law II builds upon the themes introduced in Environmental Law I whilst placing central emphasis upon the environmental and ecological implications of land use and development, and the regulation of land use activities to secure protection of biodiversity. The module commences with some cross-cutting issues, encompassing civil liability for environmental harms and human rights in respect of the environment, before turning to consideration of regimes for restricting land use to prevent unacceptable kinds of environmental and ecological harm. This involves looking at land use development controls in national law and European Community requirements for environmental assessment of projects and plans to anticipate and mitigate the environmental impacts of development. This leads into a discussion of laws that are more specifically concerned with the protection of species and habitats, either through direct restrictions upon destructive activities or through legal mechanisms to secure biodiversity conservation through designation and management of land that is of ecological importance. In respect of each topic, the object is to place discussion of national and European Community laws into context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving environmentally and ecologically appropriate land use and conservation of biodiversity, and ultimately sustainable development.

      EC532 - Environmental Economics, Institutions and Policy

      
      
       This module introduces you to environmental economics and economics generally. A key objective of the module is to help you develop an ability to apply economic thinking to environmental problems. The module considers various aspects of environmental economics including why pollution occurs and how policy can be designed and implemented to deal with it, how to place economic value on the environment and how to understand sustainable development in microeconomic terms.The module is divided into three parts. In Part A we examine the relationship between the economy and the environment. In Part B we consider how environmental policy can be designed, implemented and evaluated in relation to environmental pollution. In Part C we examine issues of environmental valuation, which is a rapidly growing area of research in environmental economics. The emphasis in all parts of the course is to understand the links between theory and practice.

      SO525 - Environmental Politics

      
      
       Environmental issues have become central matters of public concern and political contention. In this module we shall consider explanations for the rise  and social distribution of environmental concern as well as the forms of organisation that have been adopted to address environmental questions, including the emergence of global environmental issues and the responses to them. The development of environmental protest, environmental movements and Green parties are central concerns, but we shall also consider the greening of established political parties and political agenda.  Is it realistic to expect the development of a global environmental movement adequate to the task of tackling global environmental problems. The approach is broadly comparative and examples will be taken from Europe (east and west), North America, Australasia and south-east Asia.
