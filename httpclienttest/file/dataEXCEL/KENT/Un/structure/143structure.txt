      EC313 - Microeconomics for Business

      
      
       This module is designed for students who have not studied Microeconomics for Business before or who have not previously completed a comprehensive introductory course in economics. However, the content is such that it is also appropriate for students with A-level Economics or equivalent, as it focuses on the analysis, tools and knowledge of microeconomics for business. The module applies economics to business issues and each topic is introduced assuming no previous knowledge of the subject. The lectures and related seminar programme explain the economic principles underlying the analysis of each topic and relate the theory to the real world and business examples. In particular, many examples show how economic analysis and models can be used to understand the different parts of business and how policy has been used to intervene in the working of the economy. Module workshops apply economic analysis and techniques to business situations. The module is carefully designed to tell you what topics are covered under each major subject area, to give readings for these subjects, and to provide a list of different types of questions to test and extend your understanding of the material.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL302 - Introduction to Philosophy: Knowledge and Metaphysics

      
      
       Can I know that I am not dreaming? Am I the same person I was when I was ten years old? Do I have an immaterial mind or immortal soul? Am I a mere machine or do I have a free will? What are the fundamental properties of the world? Does God exist? This module is meant to be an introduction to these and other fundamental problems of philosophy. The module begins with an examination of some themes in Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy, and moves on to discuss the arguments of other classical philosophers, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and also of contemporary thinkers. Among the themes addressed are: the nature of knowledge, scepticism, personal identity, the mind-body problem, free will and determinism, primary and secondary qualities, causation, induction, God.

      PL303 - Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics

      
      
       Students studying on this module will be introduced to a number of big questions in ethics. The questions may include the following: What makes a life good? Is it happiness? Or is it something else? Another big question is: What makes actions right or wrong? Is it God demanding or forbidding them? Or are actions perhaps right to the extent that they serve to make lives better off, and wrong to the extent that they make lives worse off? Some philosophers have thought so. Others wonder: What if I steal money from someone so rich that my act in no way makes her life go any worse. Might it still be the case that I have acted wronglyeven if I haven't made anyone worse off? A third bit question is this: Whats the status of morality? Is it, for example, the case that whats right for me might be wrong for you? Does it make any sense at all to talk about moral claims being true or false, even relative to moral communities? Might moral judgments be nothing but expressions of sentiments? Throughout the course, students will be examining these and similar questions from the point of view of a variety of philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume.

      PL310 - Introduction to Philosopy: Logic and Reasoning

      
      
       Since Platos Dialogues, it has been part of philosophical enquiry to consider philosophical questions using logic and common sense alone.  This module aims to train students to continue in that tradition.  In the first part students will be introduced to basic themes in introductory logic and critical thinking.  In the second part students will be presented with a problem each week in the form of a short argument, question, or philosophical puzzle and will be asked to think about it without consulting the literature.  The problem, and students responses to it, will then form the basis of a structured discussion.  By the end of the module, students (a) will have acquired a basic logical vocabulary and techniques for the evaluation of arguments; (b) will have practised applying these techniques to selected philosophical topics; and (c) will have acquired the ability to look at new claims or problems and to apply their newly acquired argumentative and critical skills in order to generate philosophical discussions of them.It will be taught through a combination of lectures and seminars in the first half of the term, and seminars only in the second half of the term.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      PL315 - Philosophical Reading and Writing (core)

      
      
       What do philosophers do?  How do they think?  What do they typically think about?  How do philosophers write?  What sorts of writing are acceptable in philosophy?  How should you write?  How should philosophy best be read in order to be understood and assessed? In this module we will introduce you to some of the most interesting questions in philosophy, both from its history and from current debates.  As we do this we will show you how to think, read and write as a philosopher.   Some of the questions we will discuss this year include: Why is Humes fork so important in the history of philosophy?, What is the difference between evaluative and descriptive judgements in aesthetics? and What is the difference between is and ought?  We will also think about questions of more general philosophical import, such as: What it is to presuppose something?, What is it to argue in a vicious circle?, and What does a philosophical definition look like?

      CB676 - Strategy Analysis and Tools

      
      
       The module provides a broad, basic understanding of strategy and strategic management, on which further strategic analysis and exploration of strategic issues can be built.  It introduces students to the key vocabulary, concepts and frameworks of strategic management and establishes criteria for assessing whether or not a strategy can be successful.   It introduces students to frameworks for analysing the external and internal environments and to different theories of how these relate and of their impact on strategy formulation and implementation.  Students will learn how to identify strategic issues, develop strategic options to address them and decide which option(s) to recommend.   Through theoretical readings and case studies, students will develop an appreciation of strategy in different contexts and from different perspectives and of the complexity of strategic decision-making.  Students will enhance their ability to read business articles from a strategic perspective and to present strategic arguments in a structured manner

      PL596 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

      PL602 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      PL604 - Advanced Topics in Mind and Langauge

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval.The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

      PL605 - Logic

      
      
       What makes a good argument? How can we tell whether an argument is valid? Logic aims to provide answers to questions such as these. In this module we shall discuss arguments and argument structure; notions such as validity, soundness and consistency; and procedures for testing the validity of arguments in both propositional and predicate logic.

      PL610 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art?  What is an artwork?  Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common?  If so, what are they?  Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided?  Do avant-garde works count as art?  Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention?  What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally?  These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course.  After that we will consider other issues and questions.  What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities?  What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way?  Why is rock music such a part of our lives?  Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery?  What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art?  Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters?  Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code?  And what on earth is the point of public art?  What is public art?

      PL638 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations.   They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology.  Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel.  However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes.  In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist.  An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students.  However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand.  This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight.    The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers.  Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full.  These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.

      PL640 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL642 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL584 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL585 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL618 - Political Philosophy

      
      
       Is it right that the talented profit from their (undeserved) talents? Should the government provide compensation for people who find it hard to meet that special someone? Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

      PL620 - Justice, Violence and the State

      
      
       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses.

      PL625 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      CB688 - Decision Analysis

      
      
       Making decisions is one of the most important things any manager or business must do. Making smart decisions, however, can be extremely difficult due the complexity and uncertainty involved. Decision Analysis (DA) provides a structured and coherent approach to decision making. It involves a wide range of quantitative and graphical methods for identifying, representing, and assessing alternatives in order to determine a best course of action. DA is regularly employed by many leading companies in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, utilities, automotive, and financial services sectors. In this module, you learn about the basic concepts of DA and how to apply it in a variety of practical business planning situations. An indicative list of topics is provided below. Introduction to decision making: understanding why decisions are hard, the art of making good decisions, the main building blocks of structured decision making. Decision trees: a walk through of the construction and use of decision trees for graphically representing and analysing risky decision problems. Expected value decision criterion: a short introduction to probability theory, how to compute expected values, and the use of an expected value decision criteria for solving decision trees. Alternative decision criteria: different types of risk attitude and a brief overview of alternative decision criteria for incorporating risk attitude. Overview of utility theory: a critical look at expected value and potential problems with using it, the concept of utility and the elicitation of a utility function, the exponential utility function for modelling risk neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking decision makers. Dominance and sensitivity analysis: deterministic and stochastic dominance, tornado diagrams, one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis of probability estimates. Value of information: information and decision making, value of perfect information, value of sample information. Multi-criteria decision making: the analytical hierarchy process, comparing attributes, scoring alternatives, ranking alternatives, checking for consistency.

Four are European and the fifth serves as an exemplar of the more decentralised and less regulated Anglo-Saxon model. The first part of the module provides historic and contemporary background on the current working of the employment relations systems of each economy. It also introduces certain concepts, theories and issues central to the study of comparative employment relations. The second part of the module draws on the knowledge acquired in the first term to investigate major themes in a more direct comparative manner. These include management strategies, the effectiveness of trade unions, collective bargaining institutions, strikes, the role of the state, workers participation in management, the multinational company, and the EU and the social chapter.

      CB523 - International Business

      
      
       The internationalisation of commerce and the worlds capital markets has spurred a growing interest in impact and success of foreign business entities in the home country. Many business decisions are influenced by global events and constrained by international institutions, and naive thinking about international politics, economics, cultures, exchange rates and foreign competitors can quickly have an adverse effect on a firm.The module aims to provide an understanding of the complex environment in which international business takes place and the ways companies deal with these challenges. The module is taught in two parts. The first part examines the political, economic and cultural environments that affect business. It also explores the determinants of national competitive advantage, the role of government and trade regulations in conducting business, the impact of regional integration and of international organisations such as the IMF and the WTO, the motives and the impact of multinational enterprises. The second part is dedicated to analysing the ways in which international business performs main functions such as human resource management, marketing and finance in an international context. Furthermore, international negotiations issues, corporate social responsibility and the relevance of e-business to international business are discussed. Case studies are used throughout the module in order to link theory and practice.

      CB658 - Diversity in Organisations

      
      
       This module presents an overview of what workforce diversity is and its relevance and usefulness in improving our understanding and management of people (including ourselves) at work. The demographics of the population and the workplace are changing drastically because of a number of factors, such as an increasing number of ethnic minorities and women in the workforce and in management. Accordingly, there is a need to effectively understand and manage workforce diversity not only to increase organisational business outcomes but also to create an inclusive workplace in a socially responsible manner. The module will examine issues confronting managers of a diverse workforce. In particular issues such as ethnicity, race, language, ageing, disability, gender, and intersectional identities will be discussed. Two key approaches towards managing diversity will be explained, i.e. the social equity case of managing diversity, and the business benefits case of managing diversity. The module will explore a range of diversity related concepts and topics, such as social identity, stereotyping, discrimination, intergroup conflict, structural integration, and organisational change. Main themes covered by this module will include:Origins of diversity and equal opportunity in the workplace context;Social and psychological perspectives on workplace diversity;The UK and European diversity contexts;Business benefits case and social equity case of managing diversity; The legal framework for diversity;Organisational approaches to diversity;Contemporary issues central to the experiences of diverse individuals in the UK and in organisations across a range of diversity dimensions;Diversity management in an international context

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      PL514 - The Rise & Fall of Modern Philosophy: Descartes to Kant

      
      
       This course is concerned with the principal epistemological and metaphysical doctrines of great figures of European philosophy, namely: Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650), John Locke (1632-1704), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), George Berkeley (1685-1753), David Hume (1711-1776), Thomas Reid (1710-1796), and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Whilst each of these philosophers deserves to be studied in his own right, it is especially illuminating to study them in historical sequence. In the first place, all but Descartes developed their views partly in response to his predecessors. In the second place, the views in question are extraordinarily diverse  so that the course provides a fairly broad grounding in both epistemology and metaphysics. The course starts with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy. We ask, with him, how we can face the challenge of scepticism. Can we have metaphysical, indeed any kind of, knowledge? Is the soul or mind independent of the body? Is the soul immortal? Is there a God and can we prove this? What makes me the same person I was ten years ago? What are ideas and how were they conceived of throughout modern philosophy? Is everything an idea, an idea in my or in God's mind? Can I have direct knowledge about the world, or only of ideas objects cause in me? Are colours real properties of objects? Is causation a relation in the world, or only in my mind? What is the role of the senses in acquiring metaphysical knowledge? Can we have experience-independent knowledge about the world? Is Kant correct to claim that we can only know how objects appear to us, not how they are in themselves? Can we find conceptions, and misconceptions, prevailing throughout the Descartes-Kant tradition? What can we learn from these traditions and contribute to contemporary philosophy?

      PL526 - Aesthetics

      
      
       What is art? What is an artwork? Do all types and examples of (what are traditionally classed as) artworks have identifying features in common? If so, what are they? Or, are there such interesting differences between works of literature, pieces of sculpture and the like, that searching for a definition of art is a futile task and this type of question misguided? Do avant-garde works count as art? Can anything count as art, such as food, if its presented in the right way or made with the right sort of intention? What does all of this tell us about the nature of definition generally? These are some of the questions that we will explore at the start of this course. After that we will consider other issues and questions. What is the relation of art to beauty and other aesthetic qualities? What is it for a performance to be authentic and is this sort of performance to be privileged in any way? Why is rock music such a part of our lives? Is there anything aesthetically wrong with a forgery? What is the nature of aesthetic experience and of our emotional responses to art? Why do we care so much about the fate of fictional characters? Is there any difference between pornography and erotica? Are artists subject to a different moral code? And what on earth is the point of public art? What is public art?

      PL527 - Contemporary Theory of Knowledge

      
      
       Epistemology is the theory of knowledgewhat it is, how and if we can attain it, and why it is something worth pursuing in the first place. The present course provides an introduction to contemporary epistemology by way of five questions. First, how do we know things? By looking around and perceiving the world, for example. But we also know things by remembering them, introspecting, reasoning, and consulting others. Second, when do we know things? Do we, for example, need to have some kind of introspective access to our reasons in order to know, or is it sufficient that were set up in such a way that we tend to get things right, irrespective of whether we can say why? And is there such a thing as absolute knowledge, or is all knowledge relative to (say) our cultural circumstances? Third, do we know anything at all? After all, it doesnt seem that we can rule out that were dreaming right now, or that were part of some elaborate Matrix style illusion. And if we cant, can we still be said to know anything? Fourth, why care about knowledge in the first place? Is there something intrinsically valuable about knowledge, or is knowledge only valuable because it gives us greater practical success? Fifthly, who knows? What we know and the extent to which were afforded the opportunity to communicate what we know often depends on our social position. For this reason, we will also consider the extent to which structural inequalities in society may not only contribute to some people being systematically distrustedand, thereby, suffering from what Miranda Fricker has called testimonial injusticebut also enable those thereby oppressed to inhabit a privileged epistemic position, in virtue of the acute awareness that sometimes accompany the experience of the oppressed.

      PL570 - Philosophy of Medicine

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of philosophical issues arising from medical research and medical practice. Students will consider attempts to define the following terms  health, illness, and disease  and discuss what rests on their definition. Much medical practice proceeds as though medicine were a natural science. This module will probe the limitations of this conception. The placebo effect demonstrates the powerful influence of suggestion on the body and students will consider its relevance to philosophical ideas of the mind-body relation. Finally, students will consider ethical issues arising in medical practice, such as 'medically assisted death'.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      PL576 - Philosophy of Language

      
      
       Language is a wonderful thing. Groups of marks or bursts of sound are just physical entities but, when produced by a writer or a speaker, they are used to point beyond themselves. This is the property of aboutness or intentionality. Other physical entities generally don't have this property. When you hear a sentence, you hear a burst of sound, but typically you also understand a meaning conveyed by the speaker. What is the meaning of a word  some weird entity that floats alongside the word, a set of rules associating the word with objects, an intention in the mind of the speaker.? What is the difference between what your words imply and what you convey in saying them? How are words used non-literally, how do hearers catch on to the meaning of a newly minted metaphor? How can we mean and convey so much when uttering a concise sentence? How is it that learning a second language can be so frustrating and time consuming, whereas we learn our first language with no trouble at all? The questions keep coming. In this module we shall try to find some answers.

      PL578 - Advanced Topics in Mind and Language

      
      
       Please note: all Module Handbook information is subject to change pending faculty approval. The aim of this course is to engage in advanced study of Elizabeth Anscombes work in the philosophy of mind and action, and its posterity in contemporary analytic philosophy. In the first half of the course, we will focus on Anscombes "Intention", one of the most significant philosophical works of the 20th century. In the second half of the course, we will explore how central themes from Anscombes work have been further developed to contribute to some of the most exciting debates in the contemporary philosophy of mind and action.  Convenor: Lubomira Radoilska works on various topics in philosophy of mind and action. Her most recent book "Addiction and Weakness of Will" (OUP, 2013) develops a new theory of action as actualisation and engages directly with issues at the heart of this course.

      PL623 - Advanced Topics in Reasoning

      
      
       The module will cover some of the major topics of the theory of reasoning, with a focus on presenting students with new and exciting research. The syllabus will vary from year to year. The approach will be philosophical and critical, and may involve the close reading of texts. Students will be expected to engage critically with the works being studied and to formulate and argue for their own views on the issues covered. As an indication of the kind of topics covered, the following are three potential syllabi, one of which might operate in any particular year:1. Probability and probabilistic reasoning. This syllabus will present the major interpretations of probability and their connection with the various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. Topics covered might include: the classical interpretation; the logical interpretation; the subjective interpretation; the frequency interpretation; the propensity interpretation; the objective Bayesian interpretation. The key text will be D.A.Gillies (2000): Philosophical theories of probability, Routledge.2. Causality and causal reasoning. This syllabus will present the major theories of causality, including difference-making theories (probabilistic theories, counterfactual theories, agency theories), mechanistic theories (process theories, complex systems theories) and pluralist theories. It will go on to consider methods of causal reasoning in the sciences and the implications of such methods for the metaphysics of causality. In the absence of a comprehensive text, this syllabus will appeal to papers, especially those in the Oxford Handbook of Causation (OUP 2009), and Causality in the Sciences (OUP 2011).3. Invalid arguments. This syllabus will look in detail at methods of assessing the cogency of deductively invalid arguments. In particular it will present the methods of inductive logic for assessing the plausibility of arguments. It will provide an introduction to probabilistic logics and their semantics, as well as to methods of inference in probabilistic logics, with a focus on elementary methods that can be readily acquired by students with little prior training in logic and no prior knowledge of probability theory. In the absence of a text at a suitable level, this syllabus will be accompanied by a set of detailed lecture notes.Convenor: Jon WilliamsonJon Williamson works on various topics connected with reasoning, inference and scientific method, including causal reasoning in the sciences, inductive reasoning, and the nature of probability. The aim of this module is to introduce students to cutting-edge research on topics such as these. Jon is editor of the gazette The Reasoner, co-director of the Centre for Reasoning, and author of books on reasoning such as Bayesian nets and causality (OUP 2005), In defence of objective Bayesianism (OUP 2010) and Probabilistic logics and probabilistic networks (Springer 2011).

      PL624 - Continental Philosophy: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason

      
      
       Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787) is the greatest work of modern philosophy, and one of the most important and influential books written in our subject. It sets the scope and limits of human knowledge, rejects the over-confident illusions of rationalists like Leibniz and the all too modest ideas of empiricists like Locke and Hume, and sketches a programme for metaphysics with a human face, devoid of shadows or obscurity. Or so it seems. This module will investigate the official arguments Kant offers in favour of his metaphysical humility, and speculate about its more hidden motives. Close attention will be given to key parts of the text. Students who have an interest in the history of modern philosophy, the Enlightenment, metaphysics, epistemology and rational theology, and who enjoy reading and engaging in a serious and thorough manner with a classical text of philosophy are encouraged to take this course. Knowledge of the tradition Descartes-Hume (as taught in the module PL514/584) is an advantage, but not a pre-requisite for it.

      PL621 - Justice, Violence and the State

      
      
       Under what circumstances might it be permissible to use violence to further political goals?  What distinguishes different sorts of political violence?  Ought the state to have a monopoly on political violence?  Are there some methods that should never be used to further political goals?  In this course, we will look at the various forms of political violence, and consider how political and legal theorists have tried to regulate violent interaction between states and within states.  We will examine the conceptual difficulties that arise when postulating international laws, and consider the role of the United Nations as international mediator and law enforcer.  We will also look at the rights of self-determination amongst sub-national groups, and at the obligations of the international community to intervene to prevent humanitarian abuses

       Is it right that the talented profit from their (undeserved) talents? Should the government provide compensation for people who find it hard to meet that special someone? Is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation a benevolent charity, or an unelected, unaccountable group wielding enormous political power?This course is divided into two parts. The first part examines classic topics in political philosophy, such as the sources and scope of political authority, distributive justice, and the ideals of equality and freedom. The second part of the course will explore issues within contemporary political philosophy, such as our obligations to those in the developing world, the circumstances under which one might legitimately employ civil disobedience, rights of secession and self-determination, and the limits of free speech.  We will look at these issues in the context of particular case studies, such as the debate over the showing of anti-Islam film in the House of Lords, and recent secessionist movements.

      PL643 - Feminist Philosophy

      
      
       This module studies the nature of feminism as both a movement in political philosophy, and as a movement within contemporary philosophy more generally. The module begins by drawing attention to the diversity of feminist thought, highlighting three theoretical strands: liberal feminism, radical feminism and Marxist feminism. It goes on to apply these strands of feminist thought to the following areas of philosophy: First, we look at some topics in legal and political philosophy, including justice and the family; discrimination law and freedom of speech. Second, we look at some topics in applied ethics, including reproductive ethics and sexual ethics. Third, we look at some feminist perspectives in epistemology and metaphysics: about whether knowledge is gendered, whether biases are inevitable to thought and whether gender is natural or socially constructed. We also discuss the underlying question of whether feminism discriminates against men, and whether the notion of gender-inclusive feminism is a plausible one. Students will appreciate the diversity of feminist thought, and the central relevance it has to contemporary philosophy, both within and beyond its importance to political philosophy.

      PL641 - Normative Ethics

      
      
       This course is designed to introduce students to a number of approaches in what is often referred to as normative ethics. We face and hear about moral problems every day. These problems range from life and death matters concerning abortion, euthanasia and the like to other types of case such as whether to tell a lie to prevent hurting someones feelings. At some point we might wonder whether there is a set of rules or principles (such as Do not lie) which will help us through these tricky problems; we might wonder whether there is something more simple underlying all of this ethical mess that we can discern. Normative ethics contains a number of theories that attempt to give us such principles and to sort out the mess. In particular, different normative ethical theories are attempts to articulate reasons why a certain course of action is ethically best; they are attempts to say what types of feature we should concentrate on when thinking about ethical problems and why it is that such features are features which have intrinsic moral significance. Of course, ethical theories do not exist in a vacuum. As we shall see, our everyday intuitions about what is morally best are both the origin of normative ethical theories and the origin of thoughts raised against them. In all of this, the course will be examining these theories by starting with their historical roots, particularly focussing on the work of J. S. Mill, Immanuel Kant and Aristotle.

      PL639 - Death and Beauty: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

      
      
       This module concerns ideas of two of the most interesting of Western philosophers: Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. Both thinkers developed ideas that transformed much of the intellectual landscape of twentieth century, and both wrote books that prove fruitful for successive generations. They wrote on many themes: ethics, religion, aesthetics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Both take their starting point from those thinkers that came before, notably Kant and Hegel. However, they are interesting to compare because they have such different views on philosophical thought and various themes. In particular, some of Nietzsches thought is framed explicitly in opposition to Schopenhauers, with the former casting the latter as the great pessimist. An appreciation of their ideas is an important part of the education of many philosophy students. However, both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche can be hard writers to read and understand. This module is designed both to introduce some of their ideas and develop a students appreciation of them such that he or she can discuss them with confidence and critical insight. The module will not cover all of the writings of either or both thinkers. Students will typically read selections from Schopenhauers masterwork The World as Will and Representation and then selections from a variety of Nietzsches works, or one work in full. These will be read on their own, with ideas from both thinkers compared. Modern writers and commentators will be read in addition to help reveal the importance of Schopenhauers and Nietzsches ideas.
