      SO732 - Public Health and the Role of Primary Care

      
      
       There is considerable overlap between public health and primary care, and primary care practitioners are a vital part of a 'system' geared towards population health improvement and the reduction of health inequalities.  However, within primary care in England, public health is little understood, and its potential to contribute towards the public health agenda is under-realized.The rise in preventable illness and the persistence of health inequalities are amongst the greatest challenges that the health system faces.  As key agents within the health system, primary care practitioners must understand the part they can play in health improvement, health protection and the prevention of health inequalities at a population level.This module will help participants to understand what a public health approach to primary care looks like.  Students will learn about the role primary care practitioners play within a public health system, and about their relationships with others.  The module will introduce participants to innovate approaches to addressing complex public health issues.  Students will also learn about approaches taken in other countries to the integration of public health and primary care.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
