As far as possible, projects will be assigned on the basis of students' preferences  but this is not always possible: however, the project abstracts are regarded as 'flexible' in the sense that significant modification is possible (subject only to mutual consent between student and supervisor). The projects involve a combination of some or all of: literature search and critique, laboratory work, theoretical work, computational physics and data reduction/analysis. The majority of the projects are directly related to the research conducted in the department and are undertaken within the various SPS research teams.

       Credits: 60 credits (30 ECTS credits).

      PS701 - Topics in Functional Materials

      
      
       Chemists and physicists are now playing an important role in the growing field of materials research. More recently there has been a growing interest, driven by technological needs, in materials with specific functions and this requires a combination of physics and chemistry. For example, new materials are needed for the energy industry (batteries and fuel cells), for the optics and electronics industry (semiconductors, lasers and wave-guides), and for the environment (sensors, actuators and smart materials). The aim of this module is to introduce students to this area of modern materials and techniques.Examples of the topics that might typically be covered are:1. Crystal growth and defects.2. Liquid crystals.3. Magnetism and Magnetic Materials.4. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).5. Nanomaterials.6. Multiferroics.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
