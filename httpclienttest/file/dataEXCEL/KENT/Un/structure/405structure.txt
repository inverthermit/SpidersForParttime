Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CR300 - Contexts and Case Studies in Creative Events

      
      
       The principle aim of this module is to address the linked questions: what are creative event (is this even a useful term)?  Who is producing them?  Why are they important, and what effect do they have?  Are there common points of reference?  How do we critique them, talk about them?In order to address these wide reaching questions lectures will introduce events, ideas and discourses, and seminars will offer you the opportunity to question and debate these ideas and practices.  We shall look at different types of company, different artists, and different ways of working, and through the course it is expected that you will have some first hand encounters with members of the profession.We shall also use this module to develop some general skills necessary of a humanities undergraduate, skills in effective reading, writing, research and learning.Case studies may vary year to year but will always cover a range of events, including a community celebratory events; street arts, large and small scale;  corporate branding events; a site-specific installation; a festival or concert; demonstration and political acts; heritage events / re-enactments, a themed party.  These events, will be introduced with regard to their purpose, the central creative idea, the budget and logistics, the organisational structure and their outcomes. While of course this module is intended to provide you with an amount of knowledge and information about a disparate and exciting art form, it is also intended to introduce you to, and excite you about the discourses of culture and the modus operandi of a humanities student.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CR301 - Realising the Creative Idea

      
      
       This module introduces the principle management and creative skills of event design and production.  Through classes, work experiences and the production of a small creative event  students will be introduced to procedures, working methods and requirements of event design, construction, production and project management. The first few weeks of the module will act as a creative warm-up, providing a number of short exercises to help students  develop imaginative responses to project briefs and stimuli.  The module will then settle to focus on one or two more extended projects. The nature, content and focus of the project(s) will vary each year depending upon topical issues. They will always focus on developing the creative imagination and will introduce ideas related to: space, transformation, experiential environments, personal rites of passage, food and eating.  Alongside the initial creative exercise students will be introduced to techniques for managing a project, and for ensuring their ideas can be realised on time, and to budget.  Students will also be Students will therefore plan and design a project, budget it, assess the safety implications (at an introductory level  this aspect will be developed further in a later module), build and install it, organise purchases and transport, manage the project, liaise with external agencies as necessary, and finally deliver an event on time and to budget.Finally students will strike, debrief and evaluate their project(s).Essentially this module will prepare students for many of the challenges and methodologies present in later project based modules.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR307 - Production Practice

      
      
       The purpose of this module is to make students aware of technological resources available to the designer/producer of creative events, and of how to use these resources effectively and creatively.  Students will be introduced to the design possibilities offered by combinations of resources such as digital technologies and plastic or architectural objects and spaces. The module will act as an introduction to the safe use of resources available to students while studying at Kent with key issues concerning event planning and health and safety being discussed in some detail. In practical work, students will deploy creative skills while focusing upon the effective and safe management of work.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CR308 - Industrial and Regional Research

      
      
       In this module you will undertake field research into the events life of the region.  You will analyse local events - analysing and mapping them using critical notions developed in CR300 Contexts and Case Studies.  You will first research in breadth, examining the general scene, before choosing a company, locale or event to study in more detail.  You will deploy a range of approaches to this research including observation, local news archives, interviews, simple statistical analysis and participation.This research will result in a detailed survey and report on a particular aspect of the local event culture.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CR309 - Visual Communication

      
      
       The ability to visualise creative ideas is fundamental to the processes of designing and producing events and experiences.  We need to be able to evoke the quality of an idea early in the process, communicate and offer more precise renderings and plans later in the project.  We use such visualisation both to communicate our ideas to others, and to interrogate and develop our ideas, this clear and effective visual communication is vital to effective event (and experience) design, this module will introduce some techniques and processes. The skills taught on this module will be required, developed and deployed on many other modules through the programme, and should be considered essential core skills.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CR310 - The Fundamentals of Event Design

      
      
       The module aims to teach fundamental skills needed for the development of designs (visual and more thematic) for events.  While the field of events is wide this module considers some of the core skills that will be needed in many projects from Brand Experiences to Interpretive Environments, from design for Theatre to Public Art.  In essence this module proposes that a fundamental skill of the designer is an ability to articulate their vision (though drawing, collage, models and description) as this is a primary method of being able to investigate, improve and eventually sell the idea. The term will end with an exhibition of your work.In essence the module will introduce skills of research for design, drafting, making models with card and computers, measuring to scale, and presenting design idea.  You will further develop and enhance you skills in visual communications. As importantly it will introduce the more conceptual processes of design development.A project (or projects) will be set, which will vary year by year (the module handbook will provide details) but it will always be a project that reflects an aspect of the experience, events or performance industry - inflected by the degree programme for which you are registered.The skills taught on this module will be required, developed and deployed on many other modules through the programme, and should be considered essential core skills.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CR500 - The Business of Event Production

      
      
       This module develops on material studied in CR300 & CR308 and looks in detail at company structures, project management, critical path analysis, budgeting, employment and contract responsibilities, and the business context (public sector and/or private) in which events operate.  This module will provide the necessary business skills to enable students to operate in the events profession, while also equipping them with a deeper knowledge of the way the business operates to assist in the critical evaluation of events projects.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR524 - Digital and Interactive Media in Live Events and Performance

      
      
       Through lecture, discussion case study and very limited practice this module examines the impact of new technologies on live and mediated performance, and explores the relationship between digital aesthetics and culture, and contemporary performance practice. It examines both the evolution of multimedia performance and its contemporary manifestations. The module also considers questions concerning the live and the mediated aspects of performance, and explores concepts such as virtuality in relation to performance practice.Through study, and practical exercises we shall explore some of the techniques of multimedia performance, the theatrical and media languages that they employ and the contexts and impacts of their use.  We shall be attempting to develop a taxonomy of use, and in doing so problematize the definition of multimedia performance.  The programme will draw upon the students existing technical knowledge, and introduce some new technologies and systems, but students should note that this is not a technical training course, students will be expected to develop their own skills as necessary.  This module gives you an opportunity to deploy these skills in a supported and critically contextualising environment.Students will apply this acquired knowledge in the development of an original piece of creative work, and in a short written analysis of a multimedia performance. This short essay will require less theoretical analysis than that required of students in CR519, the H-level version of this module.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR525 - The Brand Experience

      
      
       You will be introduced to designing for events and experiences that add value to goods and services (and indeed nations and ideologies); events as brand experience - the development and communication of brand identity through events.  We will also examine how these commercial practices draw upon new developments in art and technology to provide a context in which the end result may be both high art and high commerce. You will consider how your event develops and communicates brand values, and engages its audience. You will study the field through the development of creative projects and the close study of contemporary examples and practice.  You may negotiate your role in the project, and the projects emphasis, in order to continue developing your areas of interest and specialism.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      MU529 - Interdisciplinary Project

      
      
       The purpose of this module is to provide opportunity for self-directed group exploration in the creation of a collaboratively developed interdisciplinary practical research project. Although each student will have to negotiate an individual and personal Learning Contract with a supervising tutor, the focus of this module remains interdisciplinary and collaborative. This will be achieved through a system of lectures, workshops, mentoring, negotiation and tutor supervision. Group projects between 3 and 5 students will be considered. Projects are undertaken and evaluated with tutor guidance. Examples of studies include: performance projects, audio-visual work and multi-media projects.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

  Year in industry

  
   The  Year in Industry gives you an opportunity to gain relevant workplace experience as part of your programme of study. We have long recognised the benefits of taking a year in industry and the increased awareness and confidence the experience brings, and now want to offer these benefits to students within the workplace.

The year in industry also gives you the opportunity to increase your contacts and network so that you can hit the ground running when you graduate.

The year in industry is in addition to your standard undergraduate programme and normally falls between your second and final year. The year itself is assessed on a pass/fail basis through employer feedback and a written report that you submit.
  


   

 




  
  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      CR505 - Creative Events Dissertation

      
      
       The dissertation offers an opportunity for you to develop on a specific area of interest, toundertake independent research (supported by an assigned supervisor) and to present asustained and detailed argument. The chosen area of research should have emerged from, and be a development on, an aspect of a module previously studied (your supervisor will advise you in this). You may chose to research areas that are more vocationally or academically inclined, and may research through field work and case studies, as well as through existing documented analysis and theory, both in hard copy and on the web.  The module will include a short series of introductory lectures on the nature of research for dissertations, following which your learning will be through supervisions (either individually or in small groups) and private study. At least 6 weeks prior to the submission of your final dissertation you will make a presentation to your supervisor that will include a summary of your project, a list of indicative content; an analysis of your research methodology and sources; and an evaluation of your current position.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR506 - Project Pitch

      
      
       Working from a brief, you will work towards making a full and persuasive pitch to your clients (also the assessment panel including professional events designers).  The brief will be arrived at in negotiation with your supervisor, allowing you to ensure the project suits your developing specialisms and interests. It may also be possible to work in a creative team if the brief is sufficiently full and complex.  This is an independent study module (albeit with initial seminar support and later small group supervision) and you will be expected to take initiative and manage your own time and work load.  Depending upon your other option this module may be undertaken either over an intensive 6 week period, or extended to 14 weeks, or indeed combinations in between.At minimum the presentation (or pitch) will include creative and practical details (key aims, models, drawings, budgets, funding streams, company structures, operations manuals) but may develop to include whatever material will best represent your idea.This module results in a project pitch, albeit with the potential for small-scale, or limited extracts of realised examples (such as may be included in a pitch).  However you may opt to undertake CR510 Independent Project Realisation in order to progress (elements of) the project further towards performance.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR510 - Independent Project Realisation

      
      
       This module provides you with an opportunity to design and realise an event/performance (or coherent extract thereof) derived from your own developing interests and skills; it gives you the opportunity to have significant control over the brief, your input and the outcome  affording you a significantly independent experience.You will agree a project proposal with your supervisor in the first 2 weeks of the module, before moving to realisation.  There are two likely contexts or scenarios for this work:1) the project may be a development of work proposed in CR506 Project Pitch, taking (aspects of) your pitch to realisation. This may be undertaken in teams (with roles specified and defined in writing) or individually.2) the project may be independent of a Project Pitch.  In this case the project is likely to be of more limited scale and logistical complexity, less ambitious and complex than a pitch, and having a clear, identifiable and discrete practical/creative content.All proposals, in whatever context, will be approved by a supervisor before work is started.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR516 - Scenography for Creative Events

      
      
       This module explores the practice and theory of scenography. You will look at the history, theory and development of scenography including the nature of theatrical space.  Through practice you will be introduced to the skills required of the scenographer. The module will be taught through workshop classes focusing on practical projects, and lecturer / seminars considering historical and theoretical contexts.  Thus you will work on design projects while studying contextualizing theories and histories.  Although the projects will vary on a yearly basis, as an indication you can expect 2 or three projects in which you will: design a performance space to occupy an found space; design a set to put in that space; design a fully integrated environmental staging for a performance.The academic study will include: the nature of performance space and the way perceptions of such space have developed; an introduction to key developments in scenographic history, but with special and close emphasis on developments emerging out of the late 19th and early 20th Century anti-naturalist experiments, and their 21st century legacies.You will be taught some basic studio procedures (perspective drawing, simple computer graphics, model making) and standard presentation techniques.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CR522 - Installations and Interventions in the PublicRealm

      
      
       Through predominantly practice, supported by lecture, discussion and visits of case studies this module examines space as site, place and environment. The transformation of space is a fundamental aspect of the creation of events and experiences; the ability to make space memorable, distinctive and fit for purpose (functional) is a key skill for the event designer. Students will learn how to read space, understand how space is experienced, and written. They will consider the role of the audience in these experiences - whether passive or active.Students will be introduced to the debates and theories around installation practice, particularly site specific practice and the widely different contexts in which such work can be employed. Students will then learn some important strategies for investigating site specificity through contextual analysis, before finally creating your own installation or environment (individual or small group projects may be possible). The theme and context of the environment will be negotiated with the tutor and may be designed for one of a number of purposes depending upon students developing interests; however, the project will foreground the transformation, describing and experiencing of space. Students will continue to develop their own interests in form, technique and content. Wherever possible, within the objectives of the module, this project will allow students to develop those interests and specialisms.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
