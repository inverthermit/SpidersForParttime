Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      HI423 - Introduction to Military History (Part1)

      
      
       This module opens with a study of the historiography of military history in order to determine the factors which have shaped the modern nature of military history as an academic discipline. From this point, the module goes on to look at the macro/strategic factors that have shaped the military experience and the waging of war including the impact of technology and the economic demands of war. The final part of the module is a series of case studies looking at the relationship between armed forces, politicians and their parent societies in order to determine the extent to which armed forces are reflections of their parent nations. The module is a vital pathway to Introduction to Military 2. Although the two are designed to be taken together, it is possible to study one alone.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HI424 - Introduction to Military History (Part 2)

      
      
       This module builds on Introduction to Military 1 and examines the separate natures of armies, navies and air forces. In addition, it looks at the factors which have shaped the experience of combat for the different branches of the armed forces and questions whether there is a timeless experience of combat. The module also looks at the great military thinkers of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries to establish their influence on the conduct of warfare including Clausewitz, Jomini through to twentieth century figures such as J.F.C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HI397 - Cinema and Society, 1930 - 1960

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with an introduction to the ways in which historians use film as evidence.  It draws on a wide range of films, and stresses that they are to be understood in the context of the societies that produced them.  The films themselves reflect the ways in which the national cinemas of Britain, Europe and America portrayed the world around them.  The module will question the extent to which cinema, the most potent method of mass communication during this period, influenced hearts and minds by looking at films that were commercially successful and popular.  In this way, students will be introduced to the use of non-literary sources as historical documents, will be taught how to interpret them and become aware of the importance of contextualising evidence within a wider framework.Topics to be covered:Britain and the Great War: The Battle of the Somme; Soviet cinema: Battleship Potemkin; America in Depression: Grapes of Wrath; Britain at War: In Which We Serve; America at War: Bataan; Germany at War: Titanic; The McCarthy Era: On the Waterfront

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI410 - Early Medieval Europe

      
      
       What happened when the Roman Empire collapsed? When did countries like England, France and Germany come into being? How violent were the Vikings? What actually happened at the Norman Conquest? This module is designed to provide an introduction to early medieval European history. We will focus on the main political events and most significant changes that took place during this period. We will also look at aspects of society and culture. The aims are that students should have a clear understanding of the outlines of European history in this period, a sense of what life was like in particular communities, and of the types of evidence that survive for historians to use. The weekly lectures will help guide students through the module, and in the regular seminars there will be opportunities to explore key debates and sources in more detail.There will be an optional fieldtrip to St Augustine's Abbey and St Martin's, Canterbury.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

       This module will examine various aspects of the British army since its formation in 1660. The term Army and Society has been used in the title of the module to emphasise that the central focus of this module will be a new military history of the British army in this period. Thus the focus will be on how the army was recruited, the composition of the officer corps (pre and post purchase), the political interventions made by the army and the role of the army in shaping the British state. The module will include thematic studies of central issues such as the composition of the officer corps, the politics of the army and the survival of the regimental system which need to be placed in a long chronological pattern. Topics which students will study in detail include; the political control of the army, the recruitment of officers and men, the role of the army in promoting concepts of Britishness,  the roles of the amateur military forces (militia, yeomanry, rifle volunteers, Special Reserve, Territorial Army and Home Guard), the mass expansion of the British army in the Two World Wars, the British experience of conscription, discipline and morale in peace and war and the British regimental system. There will also be some consideration given to the role of the British army in the British Empire and portrayals of the British army in popular culture. This module will then provide students with a solid basis from which to study various modules at I and H level, including, Churchills Army, The British Army and Empire, Armies at War, 1914-18 and Insurgencies and Counter-Insurgencies: the British and French experience since 1900.

       This module will offer a comparative study of wars in Europe from  the French Revolutionary Wars to the Cold War. The module will adopt the war and society approach to this topic and so will focus on the social composition and combat effectiveness of the armies concerned, as well as the causes of the wars,  civil-military relations and the various peace treaties. There will also be discussion of these wars at the strategic and operational level. This module will consider the French Revolutionary Wars, Napoleonic Wars, Crimean War, Wars of Italian and German Unification (including the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars), Balkan Wars, First World War, Spanish Civil War, Second World War and Cold War.

      HI431 - The Renaissance in the British Isles, 1400-1600

      
      
       English history is traditionally divided along dynastic lines and the divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period is usually dated to 1485. As Sellar and Yeatman observed The reign of Henry VII marks the end of the Middle Ages. Yet scholars of English literature, drama and culture have long been used to looking past political events and dynastic change to chart longer-term developments. This module introduces students to the years 1400-1600 as a cohesive period in English history that saw a transformation in political, literary, intellectual and religious culture. Moreover, in European terms the years from 1400 to 1600 witnessed the rise to cultural hegemony of the studia humanitatis, the discovery of the New World, and the religious upheavals of the European Reformation. This module looks at the major political events of these years  the Lancastrian Revolution, the Wars of the Roses, the Henrician Reformation, the Mid-Tudor Crisis, and the problems of female monarchy during the reign of Elizabeth I  in the context of longer term developments in the cultural, intellectual and social history of England. Students will be introduced to literary texts including both poetry and drama, material culture, and the built environment, alongside more traditional historical sources (such as chronicles, administrative records and correspondence) as sources for the historian of pre-modern England.

      HI434 - Introduction to the History of Science

      
      
       Science has arguably been the greatest force for cultural change in the last 500 years.  Scientists have changed the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and have equipped us with technologies that enable us to fly in the sky and shoot neutrinos under the ground.  They have taught us that our observations can shift the nature of physics, yet that we are nothing more than jumped-up apes.  This module visits some of the most important events and developments since the so-called scientific revolution (c. 1700) in order to give a representative view of the history of science.  It also introduces key themes that have been pursued by historians science that collectively call into question some key assumptions about what science is really like.

      HI438 - Vikings: the European Project, 750-1066

      
      
       Vikings, in the popular imagination, are commonly perceived as horn-helmeted, blood-thirsty pirates who killed and pillaged their way across Europe in the Middle Ages with their blood-stained axes. In reality, Vikings did much more than that. They changed the existing early-medieval political order for good; they contributed a great deal to the international trade, economy and urbanisation of different parts of Europe; and they explored and settled the uncharted territories of the North Atlantic, specifically the Scottish Isles, Iceland, Greenland, and as far as 'Vinland' (parts of Newfoundland), becoming the first Europeans to reach and temporarily settle in the North American continent; and they were perhaps the most engaging story-tellers of their time. By the time the Norse settled down and ceased raiding in the second half of the eleventh century, they had fundamentally altered the political, religious, economic and military history of much of the known world. This course will attempt to separate fact from fiction by critically reading and analysing primary source documents alongside archaeological, linguistic and place-name evidence, and thereby uncover the real history that lies behind the well-known stories of the Viking World. In addition, the students will be introduced to the major historiographical debates related to the Viking Age.

      HI353 - Britain and the Second World War: The Home Front

      
      
       War has often been seen as a catalyst for change. This module will examine how far this was true of politics, society, culture and the economy in Britain in the Second World War. The module will draw on a wide range of primary sources: Parliamentary debates, contemporary writings, including those of George Orwell and J B Priestley, cartoons, diaries, and personal memoirs. In order to increase familiarity with primary sources students will complete a compulsory document question as part of their Coursework. By the end of the module students should be able to discuss with authority the varying interpretations of the impact of the war. They will also have experienced the different approaches of political, social, cultural and economic historians, and this should provide a basis for choice of modules in Stage 2.

       This module aims to provide students with an historical analysis of the classic phase of British industrialisation, traditionally known as the Industrial Revolution.  Historians nowadays emphasise the gradual nature of industrial transformation in Britain, and the period considered here is sufficiently long to encompass several key issues in economic history: the transformation of the rural sector, the role of international trade in development, the origins and dynamics of industrial growth and innovation, the rise of a consumer society, the process of urbanisation, and the social costs of industrialisation.  The module will provide a grounding in historical concepts appropriate to the social sciences, and students will acquire a familiarity with historical statistics.

       The module introduces students to a broad range of material and themes relevant to the history of medicine, highlighting changes and continuities in medical practice and theory as well as in medical institutions and professional conduct. The section on ancient medicine addresses the role of Greek writers such as Hippocrates and the Roman medical tradition as represented in the texts of Galen. The section on medieval medicine focuses on major epidemics, the origins of medical institutions, and the role of medical care and cure in the context of social and demographic changes. In particular, this section addresses the role of the Black Death and subsequent plagues, as well as the history of hospitals. The section on medicine and the natural world discusses the source of medical knowledge as derived from the natural world through diverse cultural, social and scientific practices. The section on health and climate highlights the historical links between disease, climate and environment, for example the emergence of theories of miasma, putrefaction and the ideas of unhealthy climates. The section on medicine and empire introduces the historical links between medicine and imperialism from the eighteenth century onwards. The section on early modern and modern medicine explores the development of psychiatry and the asylum system in the 18th century, the rise of the welfare state and new theories of biology and disease transmission in the 19th century. These will be linked to the development of medical ethics.

      HI566 - History Dissertation

      
      
       The purpose of the Stage Two History Dissertation is to provide students with the opportunity to explore a topic of their choice in depth, and at a more critical level than is usually possible within the constraints of a normal coursework essay. The essay must not be more than 10,000 words in length, excluding the bibliography. Students choose a topic in consultation with a member of the History School, who will provide supervision and advice on sources. A definitive title must be submitted to the supervisor by the end of the Autumn Term (Term 1) of the student's second year. The Dissertation will be written in the Spring Term (Term 2) and must be submitted by 12 noon on the first Monday of the Summer Term (Term 3). Unlike the dissertation in the Special Subject, the Stage Two History Dissertation may be based on the extended reading of secondary sources, although students will be encouraged to use primary sources wherever possible. Topics should not relate directly to the Special Subject which the student intends to take in their third year.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HI6002 - The British Army and Empire c1750-1920

      
      
       Between 1815 and 1914 Britain engaged in only one European war. The Empire was, therefore, the most consistent and most continuous influence in shaping the army as an institution and moulding public opinion of the army. This module will examine various aspects of the British armys imperial experience between 1750 and 1920 (although the focus will fall, for the most part on the small wars of the Victorian period). The central focus will be on the campaigning in Africa and India, exploring how a relatively small number of British soldiers managed to gain and retain control of such vast territories and populations. Through an examination of a wide range of literary and visual primary sources, the module will also explore how the imperial soldier specifically and imperial campaigning generally were presented to and reconfigured by a domestic audience.Topics covered will include:The everyday life of the imperial soldierRepresenting the imperial hero: Henry Havelock and Charles GordonThe portrayal of imperial campaigning in contemporary popular cultureThe legacy of the Boer War: commemoration, doctrine and reformThe modern memory of colonial warfare: from Lives of a Bengal Lancer to Zulu

      HI6011 - From Crisis to Revolution: France 1774-1799

      
      
       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

      HI6034 - Anglo-French Relations 1904 - 1945

      
      
       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

       WAR STUDIES STUDENTS WILL HAVE PRIORITY ON THIS MODULE.The module will explore the nature of the British Army in the Second World War. How it reacted to the crushing defeats of 1940 in France and 1942 in the Far East before transforming itself into a war-winning force. The course will begin with the inter-war army examining its lack of doctrine and the confused role it had in British and imperial defence plans. From there it will move on to examine the transformation of the army from a pre-war small professional outfit to a vast conscript army, before concluding on the situation in 1945, the retention of peacetime conscription and adaptation to the Cold War world. It will take a broad approach to military history, studying the political, economic and cultural realities behind the force.

      HI5092 - Armies at War 1914-1918

      
      
       This module will offer a comparative study of the armies of the Great Powers during the First World War. The module will adopt the war and society approach to this topic and so will focus on the social composition and combat effectiveness of the armies concerned, along with civil-military relations and the higher strategic direction of the war. This module will therefore seek to answer some of the key questions of the Great War: how did the Great Powers manage to raise and sustain such large armies, why did soldiers continue to fight, given the appalling casualty rates; how politicised were the armies of the Great War, why were politicians allowed to embark on foolhardy military adventures, how crucial were the Americans in securing Entente victory and how effectively were economies adapted to meet the demands of the armies? Comparative topics for discussion in seminars will include; planning for war, recruitment and conscription, the officer corps, generals and politicians, discipline and morale; and attitudes to technological advances.

      HI757 - War Studies Dissertation

      
      
       The module is intended to provide students with the ability to work on a dissertation subject suitable to the discipline of War Studies with a strong element of primary source research and deconstruction. Teaching will be by seminar class in twelve fortnightly two-hour sessions. During these sessions student progress will be monitored constantly. The classes will be used to deal with every aspect of the production of a major piece of researched written work. The classes will therefore begin with research methodologies and archive sources and will develop during the course of the year to support the planning and writing-up stages. Students will be gathered into thematic/chronological groups and will be asked to make regular oral reports in class on issues relating to the research progress of their particular group. Each student will submit a full plan by at the end of Autumn term.

      HI764 - How the West Was Won (or Lost): The American West in the Nineteenth Cen

      
      
       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation. The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis. Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars. Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape. A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion. Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates. Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

      HI6024 - Napoleon and Europe, 1799 - 1815

      
      
       A decade ago John Dunne, in a review article, described Napoleonic history as a poor relation of the French Revolution that seemed on the verge of making good. These prophetic words described well the growing interest among scholars in Bonapartes ambitious Imperial mission extending beyond Frances natural frontiers. The work of historians Stuart Woolf and Michael Broers has postulated that the Napoleonic mission to 'integrate Europe under a single system of governance' could be viewed as a form of 'cultural imperialism in a European setting.' This special subject will introduce students to the pros and cons of this historiographical debate. It will give final year students an alternative means of engaging with the familiar historical category of Empire. There is no shortage of source material translated into English relating to this period. Indeed the memorial de Saint Helene has been available to the Anglophone world since 1824. Consequently a critical and in-depth engagement with primary material will be one of the priorities of this special subject. The focus on French expansion abroad, in the early nineteenth century, challenges one to move away from understanding the Napoleonic Empire in national terms; this course in essence, by its very nature, is European in both scope and content. To do this it will explore processes of acculturation and international competition on a thematic basis. It will examine, in broad multi-national manner, the complex interaction between centre and periphery or what Italians, more prosaically, describe as conflict between stato reale and stato civile. Napoleon was his own best advocate when it came to forging his posthumous legacy. Students will be encouraged to appraise critically his memoirs and understand that behind claims of progress lay a brutal struggle for the fiscal military resources of Europe. Yet, even more important will be to consider that while the military and political effects of the grand Empire were ephemeral, it created a judicial and administrative edifice which survived well beyond 1815 and continues to shape European civilisation to this day. Of course, laws do not merely structure the powers of governmental action but have a complex impact on notions of citizenship, the economy and culture (especially family life). This special subject will investigate the Napoleonic Empire in its many facets. Students will be urged actively to pursue their individual interests in either war and society, Empire, political culture and/or gender.

      HI6029 - The Great War: British Memory, History and   Culture

      
      
       The aim of this course will be to show how far the Great War has infiltrated into modern culture and to test the validity of Paul Fussell's thesis that the Great War created Britain's modern cultural atmosphere. Fussell contends that modern society is marked by a love of irony, paradox and contradiction formed by the experience of the Western Front. Against this theory we will set the ideas of Samuel Hynes and Martin Stephen, as argued in their works, A War Imagined and The Price of Pity. This course will explore how the Great War has influenced our lives and why we have certain images of it. Why, for example, do most people associate the Great War with words such as 'waste', 'futility' and 'disillusion'? Why does the morality of the Great War seem so tarnished, while the Second World War is conceived as a just war? The course will be based upon literature (high and popular), poetry, art, architecture and film. We will therefore be 'reading' a 'primary text' each week. The course will serve to highlight many of themes of the 19th and 20th century British survey courses and will further contextualise the course on Britain and the Home Front in the Second World War.
