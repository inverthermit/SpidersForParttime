 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      HI426 - Making History: Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module has two aims: 1) to contribute towards equipping the students with the necessary practical and intellectual skills for them to think and write as historians at an undergraduate level; 2) to encourage them to think reflectively and critically about the nature of the historical discipline, its epistemological claims, and why we, as historians, do what we do in the way we do it. This will be achieved through four blocks of seminars and lectures. These will cover: The practice of history, introducing history at university level at both a practical and conceptual level. Historical methodology. This will cover the development of university history in the nineteenth century and how this differed from the study and writing of history that had gone before. It will also consider the impact of the Social Sciences on the historical profession during the twentieth century. The varieties of history. This will examine some of the major themes and approaches, such as Marxism or nationalism, in modern historical scholarship. Beyond history. The final block will consider the linguistic turn and new ways of studying and writing history in the twenty-first century.A fifth component, concentrated in the first three or four weeks of the module, will provide training in core, practical skills (library and bibliographic skills, IT skills and the use of MyFolio and PDP). 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN333 - Romanticism

      
      
       This year-long course examines some of the most significant writing of the Romantic period (1780-1830) - a period in which the role and forms of literature were being redefined - alongside recent debates in critical theory. You will study a wide range of literary texts from the poetry of Blake, Wordsworth and Keats to the novels of Jane Austen and Mary Shelley, with reference to contemporary literary and political debates and against the backdrop of the periods turbulent history. In parallel, this module explores fundamental critical questions about literature: Why read it? What is an author? What is the role of poetry in society? How is literature shaped by culture? What is Art? Continuities and disjunctions between Romantic writers answers to these questions and those provided by more recent literary theorists will be a central concern of the course.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN302 - Early Drama

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of medieval and early modern dramatic genres, from ninth-century Latin church drama to the commercial theatres of Shakespeare's London. Students will learn about methods for analysing past performances and existing texts, as well as how drama interacted with and responded to pivotal moments in British history, and the culture, politics and religion of the period.  As such, the module will function as an introduction to medieval and early modern studies more broadly and a platform from which to undertake early English literature and drama modules, such as Chaucer and Late Medieval Literature, Early Modern Literature, 1500-1700 and Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama, at Stages 2 and 3.  Students will read and discuss playtexts in modern translations, both as literary objects and live performance events. Regular optional site visits and screenings will contribute to students understanding of the dramas contexts, how plays might work in performance and to what extent they still speak to twenty-first century audiences. Lectures and seminars are designed to be varied and interactive, with the opportunity for everyone to participate and to develop key academic skills. The module is assessed by seminar contributions, creative and research-based coursework and a final end-of-year project, which will allow students the freedom to explore a topic of their choice creatively.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

Topics such as the First World War, Modernism, the Holocaust, the US culture industry, postcolonial studies, as well as 9/11, will be considered and discussed in relation to fictional and critical literature, films, photography, graphic novels, music, and other media. Weekly screenings will run alongside lectures and seminar discussions. Literary works across all genres will be read in relation to visual material  such as paintings, photography, various feature and documentary films, etc  and a range of selected critical reading.

      EN332 - Writing America

      
      
       This module aims to emphasize connections between literature and culture in the USA, from early considerations of a distinct American literature to the present day. By way of six key themes or preoccupations, the module will introduce students to some of the major debates and antagonisms, and rhetorical and stylistic modes, that have formed and modified American literary and intellectual culture Questions of Belief, Gender, Race, Economy, Space, and Time will be approached through a range of textual forms set against their historical contexts and within the broader nexus of cultural production including the visual performing arts where appropriate. Students will be encouraged to examine the specific local, regional, and national frameworks within which these texts are produced, but also to look at the ways in which they resist and transcend national boundaries, in the development of an American register in world literatures for instance.

      HI434 - Introduction to the History of Science

      
      
       Science has arguably been the greatest force for cultural change in the last 500 years.  Scientists have changed the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and have equipped us with technologies that enable us to fly in the sky and shoot neutrinos under the ground.  They have taught us that our observations can shift the nature of physics, yet that we are nothing more than jumped-up apes.  This module visits some of the most important events and developments since the so-called scientific revolution (c. 1700) in order to give a representative view of the history of science.  It also introduces key themes that have been pursued by historians science that collectively call into question some key assumptions about what science is really like.

      HI438 - Vikings: the European Project, 750-1066

      
      
       Vikings, in the popular imagination, are commonly perceived as horn-helmeted, blood-thirsty pirates who killed and pillaged their way across Europe in the Middle Ages with their blood-stained axes. In reality, Vikings did much more than that. They changed the existing early-medieval political order for good; they contributed a great deal to the international trade, economy and urbanisation of different parts of Europe; and they explored and settled the uncharted territories of the North Atlantic, specifically the Scottish Isles, Iceland, Greenland, and as far as 'Vinland' (parts of Newfoundland), becoming the first Europeans to reach and temporarily settle in the North American continent; and they were perhaps the most engaging story-tellers of their time. By the time the Norse settled down and ceased raiding in the second half of the eleventh century, they had fundamentally altered the political, religious, economic and military history of much of the known world. This course will attempt to separate fact from fiction by critically reading and analysing primary source documents alongside archaeological, linguistic and place-name evidence, and thereby uncover the real history that lies behind the well-known stories of the Viking World. In addition, the students will be introduced to the major historiographical debates related to the Viking Age.

      HI431 - The Renaissance in the British Isles, 1400-1600

      
      
       English history is traditionally divided along dynastic lines and the divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period is usually dated to 1485. As Sellar and Yeatman observed The reign of Henry VII marks the end of the Middle Ages. Yet scholars of English literature, drama and culture have long been used to looking past political events and dynastic change to chart longer-term developments. This module introduces students to the years 1400-1600 as a cohesive period in English history that saw a transformation in political, literary, intellectual and religious culture. Moreover, in European terms the years from 1400 to 1600 witnessed the rise to cultural hegemony of the studia humanitatis, the discovery of the New World, and the religious upheavals of the European Reformation. This module looks at the major political events of these years  the Lancastrian Revolution, the Wars of the Roses, the Henrician Reformation, the Mid-Tudor Crisis, and the problems of female monarchy during the reign of Elizabeth I  in the context of longer term developments in the cultural, intellectual and social history of England. Students will be introduced to literary texts including both poetry and drama, material culture, and the built environment, alongside more traditional historical sources (such as chronicles, administrative records and correspondence) as sources for the historian of pre-modern England.

      HI432 - 1450 - 1600: The Age of Reformation

      
      
       This module will provide a survey of the major events, themes and historiographical debates in early modern history from the Renaissance to religious wars of the early seventeenth century. This period in European history witnessed the cultural and social upheaval of the Reformation, the advent of print and the intellectual changes associated with Humanism, the formation of recognisably modern nation states, and the beginnings of Europes troubled engagement with the wider world. . As with the complementary module on later European history (c.1600-1750) the lectures and seminars will be arranged around six key areas:  1) religion 2) intellectual and scholarly life 3) economy 4) society 5) politics and war and 6) culture. These themes will be approached through the examination of national histories, specific events, and historiographical controversies. The topics covered will reflect the research and teaching interests of the School of Historys four permanent early modernists and prepare students for early modern modules taken at I and H level. Students will be encouraged to take this module along with a similar module in the Spring term which will cover the period from c.1600 to c.1750.

      HI397 - Cinema and Society, 1930 - 1960

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with an introduction to the ways in which historians use film as evidence.  It draws on a wide range of films, and stresses that they are to be understood in the context of the societies that produced them.  The films themselves reflect the ways in which the national cinemas of Britain, Europe and America portrayed the world around them.  The module will question the extent to which cinema, the most potent method of mass communication during this period, influenced hearts and minds by looking at films that were commercially successful and popular.  In this way, students will be introduced to the use of non-literary sources as historical documents, will be taught how to interpret them and become aware of the importance of contextualising evidence within a wider framework.Topics to be covered:Britain and the Great War: The Battle of the Somme; Soviet cinema: Battleship Potemkin; America in Depression: Grapes of Wrath; Britain at War: In Which We Serve; America at War: Bataan; Germany at War: Titanic; The McCarthy Era: On the Waterfront

      HI353 - Britain and the Second World War: The Home Front

      
      
       War has often been seen as a catalyst for change. This module will examine how far this was true of politics, society, culture and the economy in Britain in the Second World War. The module will draw on a wide range of primary sources: Parliamentary debates, contemporary writings, including those of George Orwell and J B Priestley, cartoons, diaries, and personal memoirs. In order to increase familiarity with primary sources students will complete a compulsory document question as part of their Coursework. By the end of the module students should be able to discuss with authority the varying interpretations of the impact of the war. They will also have experienced the different approaches of political, social, cultural and economic historians, and this should provide a basis for choice of modules in Stage 2.

      HI366 - Britain in the Age of Industrialisation 1700-1830

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with an historical analysis of the classic phase of British industrialisation, traditionally known as the Industrial Revolution.  Historians nowadays emphasise the gradual nature of industrial transformation in Britain, and the period considered here is sufficiently long to encompass several key issues in economic history: the transformation of the rural sector, the role of international trade in development, the origins and dynamics of industrial growth and innovation, the rise of a consumer society, the process of urbanisation, and the social costs of industrialisation.  The module will provide a grounding in historical concepts appropriate to the social sciences, and students will acquire a familiarity with historical statistics.

       The module will introduce the students to the history of the U.S during its dramatic rise to industrial and international power.  Beginning with the transformation of the U.S into an urban industrial civilisation at the end of the 19th Century, it ends with a review of the American position at the beginning of the 21st century.  Themes include early 20th century reform, the rise to world power by 1918, prosperity and the Depression, the New Deal, war and Cold War, race relations, Vietnam, supposed decline and resurgence from Nixon to Reagan, the end of the Cold War, the Clinton Administration.

      EN681 - Novelty, Enlightenment and Emancipation: 18th Century Literature

      
      
       Before 1660 there was no English novel, and by the end of the eighteenth century there was Jane Austen. This module asks how such a literary revolution was possible. It investigates the rise of professional authorship in an increasingly open marketplace for books. With commercial expansion came experiment and novelty. Genres unheard of in the Renaissance emerged for the first time: they include the periodical essay, autobiography, the oriental tale, amatory fiction, slave narratives and, most remarkably, the modern novel. Ancient modes such as satire, pastoral and romance underwent surprising transformations. Many eighteenth-century men and women felt that they lived in an age of reason and emancipation  although others warned of enlightenments darker aspect. Seminar reading reflects the fact that an increasing number of women, members of the labouring classes, and African slaves wrote for publication; that readers themselves became more socially varied; and that Britain was growing to understand itself as an imperial nation within a shifting global context. It asks students to reflect, as eighteenth-century writers did, upon the literary, cultural and political implications of these developments

      EN692 - Early Modern Literature 1500-1700

      
      
       This module offers a survey of early modern literature from 1500 to 1700. Looking at a wide range of literature including poetry, prose and drama, students will consider the relationship between literary debate and form on the one hand, and political change, social identity and religious transformation on the other. We will consider how important debates surrounding political, social, gender and religious identity inflect and are reflected in the literature of the period, including works by Baldwin, Donne, Lanyer, Marvell, Milton and Behn. Students will also explore the boundaries of the literary canon, encountering pamphlets, sermons and conduct books, and consider the ways in which literary and non-literary texts both mirror and influence culture and society.

      EN694 - Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama

      
      
       The drama of early modern England broke new literary and dramatic ground. This module will focus on key plays across the period, exploring the development of dramatic writing, playing companies home within the London theatres, dramas links to court entertainment and its relationship to the provinces. Dramatic and literary form will be a central preoccupation alongside issues of characterisation, culture, politics and gender. Shakespeares work will be put into context in relation to the plays of contemporary dramatists as well as the various cultural, historical and material circumstances that influenced the composition, performance and publication of drama in early modern England.

      EN697 - Chaucer and Late Medieval English Literature

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of writing from the late medieval period.  It will focus on a number of central genres in English literature that emerge between the late fourteenth and early sixteenth centuries (from romance, tragedy and fabliaux through to morality plays and devotional prose) and will explore some key topics and themes in medieval literature, such as authority, gender, sexuality, piety, chivalric identity, narrative and voice, truth and destiny.  Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales will offer an accessible introduction to these core genres and themes, and initiate students in issues that are pertinent to less familiar writers and texts from the period, such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Malorys Le Morte Darthur, and The Book of Margery Kempe.  During the course of the module you will also learn about the historical and cultural contexts of the fourteenth, fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and how such contexts influenced the literature of the period.The themes and theories covered by the course will vary in response to the lecture programme and the emphasis and research specialisms of individual teachers.  Previous topics have included: gender and sexuality; authorship and patronage; history of the book; manuscripts and the printed texts; piety and devotion; iconography; social relations; performance cultures; audience, reading and reception; the body, corporeality and experience.

      EN695 - Empire, New Nations and Migration

      
      
       This course will introduce students to the field of postcolonial literature, focusing on the period from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The course will be divided into three consecutive areas: empire and colonisation; the processes of decolonisation; and migration and diaspora. Centred primarily on canonical British colonial texts, the first part of the course will explore issues surrounding language, cosmopolitan encounters, Orientalism, modernism and the genres of imperial fantasy. The texts in the second part of the module will be drawn from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. The intention is to allow students to bring these disparate regions and texts into a productive dialogue by reflecting on their common engagement with colonial and liberation discourses, as well as the legacies of partition. The course further aims to sketch a narrative of empire and decolonisation that links these issues to the context of narrating migration in our contemporary postcolonial world, a subject taken up more directly in the final part of the course.Some brief extracts from critical material on colonial discourse and history, decolonisation, postcoloniality and migration will be considered alongside the primary text each week. Together with a broad primary textual arc that stretches from the British empire to the contemporary metropolis, the course will give students a coherent intellectual narrative with which to explore changing conceptions of culture, history and postcolonial identity across the modern world.

      EN677 - The Contemporary

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of contemporary literature written in English, where contemporary is taken to refer to twenty-first century work. It will equip students with critical ideas and theoretical concepts that will help them to understand the literature of their own time. Students will consider examples of a range of genres: poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction and the essay. They will also be selectively introduced to key ideas in contemporary theory and philosophy. Over the course of the module, students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts. They will consider writers responses to, for instance, questions of migration, environmental change, and financial crisis. They will also consider a range of aesthetic developments and departures, for example: new conceptualism and the claim to unoriginality; the turn to creative non-fiction; the re-emergence of the political essay. The module will not focus on a given national context. Instead it will set contemporary writing against the background of identifiably international issues and concerns. In so doing it will draw attention to non-national publishing strategies and audiences. Overall, the module will aim to show how writers are responding to the present period, how their work illuminates and reflects current cultural concerns. The module will alternate, week by week, between thematic and formal concerns.

      EN689 - Modernism

      
      
       This module features key modernist texts, for example the work of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D., Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys. It also makes substantial reference to key philosophical theories of modernity and textuality. The literary works are taken mostly from a restricted period 1910-1939. Other texts which might form part of the curriculum may include a limited selection of works by F.T. Marinetti, Mina Loy, D.H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Samuel Beckett, Mikhail Bakhtin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Derrida. One focus in the module will be the notion of the artist as applied to the writer as an art-practitioner. Other topics include modes of representation, textuality and identity, the relationship between language and experience, war and democracy, class and politics, notions of exile, cosmopolitanism and bohemianism, sex, morality and city life. This material requires both theoretical and historical orientation, as well as skill in distilling significance from complex literary artefacts with regard to the network of mediations which both bind such works to their apparent context and appear to dislocate them.

      EN672 - Reading Victorian Literature

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of Victorian literature. It will equip students with critical ideas that will help them become more skilful and confident readers of texts in and beyond this period. Students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts: environmental (for example, considering the effects of urbanisation and the Industrial Revolution); imaginative (examining a range of genres such as poetry, novel, short story); political (class conflicts, changing gender roles, ideas of nation and empire); and psychological (representations of sexuality, parent-child relationships, madness, dreams). Students will be made aware of concepts such as modernity and will be encouraged to think about various developments of literary form in the period.

      EN675 - Declaring Independence: 19th Century US Literature

      
      
       When the Long Island-born poet Walt Whitman proclaimed in 1855 that the United States were historys greatest poem he made an important connection between national political culture and literary expression. In some ways this was no exaggeration. As a new experiment in politics and culture, the United States had to be literally written into existence. Beginning with Thomas Jeffersons dramatic Declaration of Independence in 1776, followed by the drafting of the Constitution after the Revolutionary War with Britain, the project of shaping the new United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was essentially a literary one.  In this module we will explore how American writers in this period tried in numerous, diverse ways to locate an original literary voice through which to express their newfound independence. At the same time, the module includes the work of writers who had legitimate grievances against the developing character of a new nation that still saw fit to cling to such Old World traditions as racialized slavery, class conflict and gender inequality.

      HI5013 - Popular Religion and Heresy, 1100-1300

      
      
       This module examines the rise and spread of popular religious movements in Western Europe from the eleventh to the early fourteenth century and considers how some of these movements became seen as heresy and were associated with political dissent, ideas of persecution and social and economic change. It also considers the leadership of the Medieval papacy and its contribution to the transformation and condemnation of religious and heretical movements. The module finally explores the reasons why popular religious movements provoked such strong reactions and compares and contrasts the treatment of these religious and heretical movements with that given to other social minorities (especially women, lepers and homosexuality).The course will draw on narrative, hagiographical, documentary and visual sources. The course will require students to engage with primary sources, and to think critically about theoretical approaches toward the above mentioned themes.

      HI5021 - Science, Power and Politics in Twentieth Century Britain

      
      
       This module covers the period approximately 1900-79 and follows the fortunes of H. G. Wells open conspiracy  his scheme by which scientists would rule the world.  The aim is to understand what scientists (and their friends and critics) thought was the social role of science during this period, and how they sought to make sure that science played that role.  We aim to find out why scientists thought a scientific approach to life and society was desirable; how they sought to impose it; and to what extent, or in what ways, they were successful in their aims.  Along the way we will see how scientists engaged with particular political ideologies, and with the government.  Examples covered include the poverty vs. ignorance nutrition debate during the great depression, the development of nuclear power and consumer technology at the Festival of Britain.  We will see the pivotal role played by WWII in terms of facilitating scientists ambitions to govern, and the rise of psychology as arguably the most influential science in terms of governance.  The module makes particular use of fictional and documentary film sources as a means to understand the place of science in public culture.

       Between 1815 and 1914 Britain engaged in only one European war. The Empire was, therefore, the most consistent and most continuous influence in shaping the army as an institution and moulding public opinion of the army. This module will examine various aspects of the British armys imperial experience between 1750 and 1920 (although the focus will fall, for the most part on the small wars of the Victorian period). The central focus will be on the campaigning in Africa and India, exploring how a relatively small number of British soldiers managed to gain and retain control of such vast territories and populations. Through an examination of a wide range of literary and visual primary sources, the module will also explore how the imperial soldier specifically and imperial campaigning generally were presented to and reconfigured by a domestic audience.Topics covered will include:The everyday life of the imperial soldierRepresenting the imperial hero: Henry Havelock and Charles GordonThe portrayal of imperial campaigning in contemporary popular cultureThe legacy of the Boer War: commemoration, doctrine and reformThe modern memory of colonial warfare: from Lives of a Bengal Lancer to Zulu

       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

       This module is meant to introduce students to the key processes and dynamics of sub-Saharan African history during the past two centuries. The course covers three chronological periods: the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. In their study of the pre-colonial period students, will especially familiarize themselves with the changing nature of African slavery and the nineteenth-century reconstruction of political authority in the face of economic, environmental and military challenges. The colonial period forms the second section of the course. Here, students will gain an understanding of the modalities of the colonial conquest, the creation and operation of colonial economies and the socio-cultural engineering brought about by European rule. The study of the colonial period will end with an analysis of African nationalisms and decolonisation. In the final part of the course, students will develop an understanding of the challenges faced by independent African nations. The nature of the post-colonial African state will be explored alongside such topical issues as the Rwandan Genocide and the African AIDS epidemic.

       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation.  The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis.  Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars.  Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape.  A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion.  Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates.  Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

       The purpose of the Stage Two History Dissertation is to provide students with the opportunity to explore a topic of their choice in depth, and at a more critical level than is usually possible within the constraints of a normal coursework essay. The essay must not be more than 10,000 words in length, excluding the bibliography. Students choose a topic in consultation with a member of the History School, who will provide supervision and advice on sources. A definitive title must be submitted to the supervisor by the end of the Autumn Term (Term 1) of the student's second year. The Dissertation will be written in the Spring Term (Term 2) and must be submitted by 12 noon on the first Monday of the Summer Term (Term 3). Unlike the dissertation in the Special Subject, the Stage Two History Dissertation may be based on the extended reading of secondary sources, although students will be encouraged to use primary sources wherever possible. Topics should not relate directly to the Special Subject which the student intends to take in their third year.

       This module will offer a comparative study of the armies of the Great Powers during the First World War. The module will adopt the war and society approach to this topic and so will focus on the social composition and combat effectiveness of the armies concerned, along with civil-military relations and the higher strategic direction of the war. This module will therefore seek to answer some of the key questions of the Great War: how did the Great Powers manage to raise and sustain such large armies, why did soldiers continue to fight, given the appalling casualty rates; how politicised were the armies of the Great War, why were politicians allowed to embark on foolhardy military adventures, how crucial were the Americans in securing Entente victory and how effectively were economies adapted to meet the demands of the armies? Comparative topics for discussion in seminars will include; planning for war, recruitment and conscription, the officer corps, generals and politicians, discipline and morale; and attitudes to technological advances.

       Focusing on the history of modern Germany in the Twentieth Century, the module examines major changes and continuities in the development of a highly advanced, industrialised but also militarised European nation state which played a central role in shaping the modern European geographical and political landscape. The module explores the end of the Imperial Monarchy after the end of the First World War in 1918, the role of the Allied reparation demands, hyper-inflation and political instability of the Weimar Republic, and the rise of National Socialism and the Third Reich during the 1930s. The course will chart the influence of anti-Semitism, racial eugenics and geopolitics in Germanys quest for world domination during the Second World War and assess the legacy of the Holocaust in defining post-war German identity and society. By examining the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the module will take a critical look at the politics, ideology and day-to-day history (Alltagsgeschichte) of East and West German society during the Cold War, and explore the underlying factors which led to the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and subsequent German reunification.

       Society has always been fascinated by those deemed different and over time, unusual people have been viewed and constructed in a myriad of ways.  The course explores the continuities and changes surrounding those classed as different. Broadly, the course will investigate the changing nature of difference from the 1780s to the 1920s. It will examine the body and mind as contested sites; spaces occupied by those considered different; the establishment of normality versus deviance; the changing conceptions of difference over time; relationships between unusual people and the wider society. Using a broad range of sources, from novels to film, the course will trace the shifting cultural constructions of difference.

       This module explores the place of death within late medieval English culture, focusing especially on the visual evidence of tombs, architecture, and illuminated manuscripts. It will begin by examining how ideas about death and the dead were expressed in works of art before the arrival of the Black Death to England in 1348. We will then explore the ways in which funerary sculpture, architecture and painting changed after, and perhaps because of, the devastation of the plague. These sources will be set within the context of literary, documentary and liturgical evidence. Further, it will explore how historians approach the history of death from different disciplinary perspectives, and consider the place of visual evidence within a range of sources and methods.

       Condemned by the international community for refusing to sign the Kyoto Accords, rendered powerless by electricity blackouts, and stricken by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the United States of America is today embroiled in a narrative of environmental controversy and catastrophe.  This module explores to what extent the USA has been inviting doomsday throughout the modern (twentieth-century) period.  Commencing with an introductory session on writing and researching American environmental history, the module is then split into four sections: Science and Recreation, Doomsday Scenarios, Environmental Protest, and Consuming Nature.  Over the twelve weeks we will consider a range of environmental issues that include wildlife management in national parks, pesticide spraying on prairie farms, nuclear testing in Nevada, and Mickey Mouse rides in Disneyland.  By the end of the module, we will have constructed a comprehensive map of the United States based around themes of ecological transformation, assimilation and decay.

      HI6036 - Science Satirised

      
      
       By looking at how science and its practitioners have been represented in or made use of satire, we gain an important perspective on how science and society have interacted as the former came to dominance as an authoritative source of knowledge. Friends and enemies of science have used satire to gain sympathy or call its claims into question. Where science has provoked hope, fear, admiration or suspicion, where it has been deeply involved in political or military endeavour, where it has overstated its claims or fed visions of a better future, satire has cast popular and elite opinions into sharp relief. From Thomas Shadwells The Virtuoso and Gullivers Travels, Georgian and Victorian caricature, science fiction and Cold War film, to The Simpsons and the Infinite Monkey Cage, science and the men and women who have produced it have proved to be fertile sources for comedy and biting wit.

How it reacted to the crushing defeats of 1940 in France and 1942 in the Far East before transforming itself into a war-winning force. The course will begin with the inter-war army examining its lack of doctrine and the confused role it had in British and imperial defence plans. From there it will move on to examine the transformation of the army from a pre-war small professional outfit to a vast conscript army, before concluding on the situation in 1945, the retention of peacetime conscription and adaptation to the Cold War world. It will take a broad approach to military history, studying the political, economic and cultural realities behind the force.

       We seem, as it were, to have conquered andpeopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind.Sir John Seeley, The Expansion of England (1883)Despite Seeleys assertion of accidental conquest, at its zenith the British empire decidedly controlled over &frac14; of the worlds global real estate, and 1/5 of the worlds population. The economic, cultural and global impact of British colonialism is still very much apparent today - from contested borders and inter-state disputes, through languages and cultures, to the inequities in wealth and trade that exist between the prosperous North and the underdeveloped South. Why, then, was imperial expansion so vehemently defended by its protagonists in the 19th and 20th Centuries? And what made colonial conquest, colonisation, and economic exploitation of non-European spaces feasible on such a global scale and for so long? These are the big questions that underlie this module. Using documentary sources and specialist texts and articles, we shall investigate various aspects of British colonial rule from the perspective of its practitioners and from that of their colonial subjects. The intention is to try and understand European imperialism on its own terms, to interrogate the cultural and conceptual discourses that underpinned its existence, and to reflect upon the many ways in which the history of European empire has shaped the modern world in which we live today.

       Seventeenth-century Britain experienced considerable division and tension, most obviously in the Civil Wars in mid-century between the countries which comprised the multiple kingdom of Britain.  The aim is to examine the reasons for, and the attempted resolution of, major political and religious problems, with a clear sense of the European context in which these events were played out.  Topics to be studied will include the ideological clashes between crown and parliament in England; the political and cultural divisions of `court' and `country'; religious disunity across the three kingdoms; the expansion of a `public sphere' of politics and religion; the failure of republican government in the 1650s; the instability of Restoration politics and the coming of the Glorious Revolution; and Britain's changing role in Europe across the century.

       Fundamental to Western European political and cultural ambitions since the mid-eighteenth century has been technological change.  This module provides a unique and stimulating social history of science and technology in a period of industrialisation and imperial expansion.  In the first part, we examine the twin foundations of British industrial and imperial power exemplified by the dramatic eighteenth-century voyages of Captain James Cook around the Pacific, and by the evolution of the steam engine by James Watt in the same period.  In the second part of the module we focus on the powerful new nineteenth century technological systems - railways, steamships, electric telegraphs and ship canals - which served to discipline the diverse cultures of Empire, whether British, American or Continental.  In these ways, the module will provide a striking foundational study for an enriched understanding of politics and society in the modern world.

      EN604 - The Unknown: Reading and Writing

      
      
       The Unknown asks you to think creatively and analytically and to learn by a combination of careful reading and experimental writing.  You will be able to use the skills of critical analysis and close reading developed elsewhere in your degree in new ways and to take a fresh look at the study of literature.  The course draws on the ideas writers have about writing, as well as on psychoanalysis, literary theory, fiction, poetry, drama and film.  It asks you to think deeply about how, and why, you read and write.

      EN700 - Metropolis: Writing and Spectacle in Early Modern London

      
      
       London became a metropolis in the sixteenth century  it grew wildly in size and its big city status made it the entertainment capital of England. This module analyses the relationship between a developing city and an expanding cultural life in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. It considers the increase in playhouses, shopping, street life, religious life and public shaming. It explores the dynamics between urban life and writing  the way Londoners wrote about their city, the way satirists punctured its self-image, the way courts recorded its crimes and the way entertainment was scripted. It investigates the interplay between spontaneous popular culture and structured civic entertainment, and between court culture and prostitution. Topics to be covered include mapping the city: Stowes Survey; working London: street cries and the water poet; street performances: sermons and book burnings; women on the margins: cony catching and prostitution; and shopping in London: the new exchange and its plays.

      EN701 - The Global Eighteenth Century

      
      
       This module will examine the interactions between Britons and the world beyond Europe during the eighteenth century and the different sites of exchange and domination, as well as hybrid cultural articulations, that emerged from these interactions.  We will look at a variety of texts that depict non-European people and places, as well as texts that were read by Britons and written by foreign and colonial peoples, to assess critically the transnational and transatlantic understanding and influences of the period.  We will explore topics such as Cosmopolitanism in the Eighteenth Century, Foreign Influence on British Identity, The Material Culture of Empire, and Transatlantic Culture.  Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the postcolonial study of eighteenth-century literature and the ethical and political implications of these texts and the ways in which we choose to approach them.

      EN702 - Thomas Hardy

      
      
       This module will explore the range of Hardy's work including his novels, some short fiction poetry, prose, and autobiography, in the light of specifically nineteenth-century concerns such as the emergence of modernity, the impact of science, the beginnings of modernism, and the shift from the rural to the urban.  Themes to be explored will include Hardys changing position as an author throughout his career; his development of forms of narrative; his views on history and philosophy; the representation of class; anxieties about social, cultural and economic change; the status of the human and the animal; his interest in evolutionary theory and its widespread effect; and finally, his career and position as a twentieth-century poet.

      EN703 - The 'Real' America: Class and Culture in the American Gilded Age

      
      
       What is at stake when artists and writers decide to take the real world as the subject of their art? In the later nineteenth century, to depict reality in fiction and art became a radical act of social protest and critique. In an endeavour to locate the truth behind American society, realists moved well beyond pre-existing societal norms to investigate the squalid living conditions of immigrants in the New York slums, participate in Native American religious ceremonies, and probe the psychosexual neuroses of the middle classes. This module explores the American ideology of realism (Michael Elliot) in the late nineteenth- and early- twentieth centuries as expressed in a variety of forms and genres, including: the novel, painting, anthropology and photography. We will discuss the reasons behind the emergence of realism in the later nineteenth century, how it interacted with the new mass culture, whether it critiqued or reinforced dominant racial, sexual, ethnic and class-based prejudices, and, finally, why it declined in the twentieth century as the favoured aesthetic of the American avant-garde. On this module we will move far beyond seeing realism as merely a tame, neutral artistic style to investigate how it pointed to a radical way of seeing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century world. The module includes only 3 longer works (Wharton, Howells, and Mooney).

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN704 - Discord and Devotion: Society & Spirituality in Middle English Literatu

      
      
       This module will introduce students to late-medieval models of social order and, against these official representations, explore how established concepts of identity and social status were debated, destabilized and renegotiated.  Through analysing texts such as William Langlands Piers Plowman, the letters of John Ball, Chaucers Canterbury Tales, selected lyrics and a variety of historiographical texts, the course will investigate the ways in which attempts to control social movement were challenged and contested.  In a period in which traditional feudal social structures were being supplanted by an emergent proto-capitalist economy, the lower orders were demanding a new political platform and English literature reveals both social aspirations and reactionary anxieties.In parallel with the political tumult, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries also saw a rise in non-official, heterodox forms of spirituality, licensing individual devotional practices that similarly challenged the perceived hegemony of the Church.  Investigating works of affective devotion, like The Book of Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwichs Revelations of Divine Love, and a variety of religious lyrics and plays, in addition to Wycliffite and Lollard sermons, the module will uncover the growing popularity of devotional forms predicated upon a personal relationship with and experience of the divine.  These practices (like their political counterparts) decentred spiritual authority and reveal a theological ambition which problematised orthodox religion in multiple ways.  Within these reimagined visions of social and religious structures are the seeds of new ideas that would shape the future of the English nation; in such visions the common man gains power and authority, women are empowered as spiritual leaders, and the authority of Church and State is subject to lay criticism and intervention.

      EN705 - The Contemporary Memoir

      
      
       Why is the memoir such a popular genre in contemporary literature? Are memoirs individualistic, sentimental and voyeuristic (what is often dismissed as misery literature) or can they have strong ethical impulses and powerful real-world effects? This course critically examines the significance of the memoir  a first-person account of a part of ones life, often written by someone not previously known as a writer in late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century literature. Through reading a range of recent memoirs we will examine the themes, techniques and debates that have come to characterise this genre. Drawing on a range of aesthetic, theoretical and cultural perspectives, we will approach these memoirs both as literature  as rich sources for critical analysis and capable of transforming academic criticism  and in terms of their appeal, and sometimes controversial reception, within present-day mass audiences.  We will also expand our discussion of memoirs to consider graphic narrative and film.

      EN706 - The Love Poem: Wyatt to Nick Cave

      
      
       The Love Poem will tell a history of English poetry through the lens of its most important and singular genre. Students will interrogate the characteristics of modern poetry itself through an investigation of love, desire, gender and intimacy as they have been articulated through the changing lyrical tradition of the language. The module will examine key canonical writers from the beginnings of the English lyric, including Thomas Wyatt and William Shakespeare, through complications in metaphysical poetry, the ballad and Romanticism, up to present day representations of homosexual love, popular song and avant-garde expression. Poets will be studied alongside theorists such as Alain Badiou, Roland Barthes and Henri Bergson, exploring the possible ways in which poetry can be said to challenge dominant modes of love, interact with their social environment through love poetry, and investigate, express and explain the experiences of attraction, attachment and loss.

      EN709 - Animals, Humans, Writing

      
      
       What is the relationship between animal and human, and how is this explored through writing? This module seeks to examine creaturely relations by focusing on literature from the 18th century up to the present, alongside key theoretical and contextual material that engages with questions concerning animality and humanity. We will focus on how writers imagine distinct animal worlds as well as how they understand the role of animals in human cultures. A range of novels, short stories and poems will raise questions about how we look at, think with, and try to give voice to animals, and topics covered will include Becoming Animal, Listening to Animals, Animal Experiments' and Tasting Animals. Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the diverse critical field known as animal studies, whilst also considering the broader cultural, philosophical and ethical implications  of how we think about the relationship between humans and animals.

      EN710 - Victorian Aestheticism and Decadence

      
      
       This module is an intensive study of aesthetic and decadent literature in late Victorian Britain. We will explore some of the key literary and critical works that popularised the concept of the 'aesthetic' and the ideal of the aesthetic life, and examine how and why 'art for art's sake' and 'decadence' came to be understood as the watchwords of a countercultural movement. The module also takes in along its way some of the manifestos, scandals, satires, and controversies that made aestheticism and decadence vivid in the public imagination, such as the 'Fleshly School of Poetry' controversy, the notorious periodical The Yellow Book, and the three trials of Oscar Wilde. This module pays particular attention to the relationship between the literary and visual arts, and aims to help students gain a sophisticated understanding of the intellectual and imaginative stakes of Victorian aestheticism and decadence, as well as of the social and material contexts from which a 'cult of beauty' arose in late Victorian Britain. We will consider the ways in which Aestheticism and Decadence look backward to Romanticism and forward to Modernism; how they became a means of imagining alternative sexualities, identities, and lifestyles; and how they clarify (or falsify) the relations between art, ethics, and politics.

       The module will focus on innovative poetry by British and Irish writers from the British Poetry Revival of the 1970s to the present day. A crucial organising principle throughout the module will be the close connections between these literary works and discourses in history, culture, politics and philosophy. The module will also introduce the students to how these poetsas a part of their creative processengaged with concepts such as research, visuality, and performance. Writers to be studied include Caroline Bergvall, Sean Bonney, Allen Fisher, and Maggie OSullivan.

      EN714 - Utopia: Philosophy and Literature

      
      
       The module examines some key texts in the theory and literary presentation of utopia. In the first part of the module we will examine classic early utopian texts (Plato, More) and will set these in the context of the modern theory of historical progress (Hegel) the failure of that progress to materialise (Agamben) and the nature of hope for the future (Bloch). In the second part of the module, we will examine modern classics which look at the failure of the communist utopia (Zamyatin, Huxley, Orwell) and at later texts which revived the genre of utopia (LeGuin, Atwood).

      EN715 - Performing Vice c.1350-1550

      
      
       This module explores the representation and performance of sin, vice and misbehaviour in drama, c. 1350-1550.  Students will examine a range of medieval and early Tudor dramatic modes, and will consider how ideas about vice and sin were conveyed through performance, how such presentations worked in conjunction with their virtuous and divine counterparts, the audiences own embodied experience and the potential problems inherent in the bodily pleasures of performance.  Via the study of vice and sin, students will also encounter core aspects of medieval and early Tudor performance culture, dramaturgy, and the material, social and religious conditions that informed drama in this period.  In addition, students will be introduced to a range of non-dramatic primary sources, such as the Records of Early English Drama, medieval philosophy and theology, iconography, spiritual and devotional manuals, and etiquette books, which will sit alongside the playtexts and inform our understanding of medieval concepts of vice.  Modern theories of embodiment, cognition, space, phenomenology and performance will underpin the study of vice on this module and students will be asked to assess the usefulness of these models as a way of critically engaging with medieval and early Tudor drama.

      EN716 - Marxism, Literature and Culture

      
      
       This module offers students a synoptic perspective on Marxist cultural criticism from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day in Europe, Russia and North America. It begins with an analysis of a selection from Marxs own writings, with the aim of introducing key terms, such as alienation, ideology, and dialectic. Students understanding of these terms and their critical uses for literary and cultural studies will develop during the course of the module, as they encounter a range of important Marxist thinkers and their writings. Throughout the module students will be invited to interrogate and transgress the boundaries separating literary from critical texts, and theory from practice. They will be invited to consider creative practice and Marxist criticism in dialogue with one another at particular historical moments. Although anchored in the literary and the textual, the module will also offer opportunities to think critically about the term culture itself in its broadest senses, encompassing a range of aesthetic and social practices, such as sport and music. Progressing through the great class conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Frankfurt School, New Left and anti-racist decolonization movements of the postwar period, up to the contemporary neoliberal moment, the module aims finally to offer students a set of tools with which to understand their own cultural encounters in the present as well as to reconfigure and re-evaluate the cultural knowledge they have accumulated in stages one and two of their degree programmes.

      EN717 - The Graphic Novel

      
      
       This module focuses on the exploration of the graphic novel as a visual and literary medium. The module will interpret the term graphic novel broadly, and incorporate discussions of comic books, political cartoons, as well as film and television adaptations as a part of its curriculum. The module will begin with an examination of the more mature aesthetic that became increasingly popular for graphic novels during the late 1980s, and examine how these developments have continued to evolve to the present day. Strong emphasis will be placed on readings informed by sociological and political discourses. Students will be encouraged to relate their close analysis of texts to topics such as the distinctions between art and popular culture, and the connections between literary and social history, as well as contemporary concerns such as identity politics, neo-liberal capitalism, protest, and anarchy. As such, the module will demonstrate how the study of graphic novels directly relates to several key concerns in the study of undergraduate English.

       The module focuses on the literary production of North Americas indigenous peoples, drawing on the historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts of one tribe, the Anishinaabeg, or Ojibwe. Students will be encouraged to explore aesthetic and intellectual developments in Native literature and theory; to examine the nature of indigenous status in relation to both North America and the wider world; and to draw on their understanding of canonical literature and literary theory to isolate points of intersection and divergence between Native American and American literatures. We will cover a wide range of literary forms, from transcriptions of oral traditions, through autobiography, to the postmodern novel; and scrutinize and employ a number of strategies of reading the unfamiliar, from ethnological discourse to tribal literary nationalism.The relationship between Native American literature and art will be a key feature of lecture/workshop discussion and, where appropriate, film screenings will be offered.

      EN633 - Bodies of Evidence: Reading The Body In Eighteenth Century Literature

      
      
       This module explores the eighteenth-century fascination with bodies and the truths (or lies) bodies were supposed to reveal. The course focuses on the ways in which the body is read and constructed in eighteenth-century literature and how these readings and constructions reflect various concerns about class, race, gender and sexuality. Through the course of this module we will examine a range of literary representations of the body which seek both to control the body and to celebrate its destructive potential. We will read texts from a variety of genres, including medical literature, misogynist satire, sentimental novels, popular fiction, travel writing and pornography alongside recent critical work by Thomas Lacqueur, Michel Foucault, Roy Porter, Stallybrass and White, which illuminate the ideological stakes writers played for when writing about the body. Topics for discussion will include disability and deformity, race, the sentimental body, dress and the body, the body as a text and the relationship between the body and the body politic. The primary focus of this option will be literature, but we will also examine visual representations of the body in caricature and satire as well as in the portraiture.

      EN637 - Unruly Women and Other Insubordinates: the dramatic repertoire of the Q

      
      
       Unruly Women & Other Insubordinates:   The Dramatic Repertoire of the Queen Anna's Men (1604-1625) The Jacobean period is renowned for producing some of the most incisive, inventive, and interrogative drama in the English language --  plays which both delve into the darker corners of human experience (lust, temptation, sin, revenge) and affirm positive values for humanity (love, compassion, tolerance).  In this challenging module we will study a selection of plays in the context of the dramatic company that performed them,  Queen Annas Men.  In so doing we will engage with immediate contexts of dramatic production in the period: the organisation, work, and role of the dramatic company; the impact of playhouses and their audiences; the often collaborative nature of playwriting (particularly the work of Thomas Heywood, but also that of  John Day, Thomas Dekker, William Rowley and  John Webster).  We will also pay attention to the literary qualities of these plays, especially their complexities of genre (comedy, tragedy, tragi-comedy) and subtleties of language.  Combining literary analysis with an attention to the specific work of one dramatic company, this module offers an innovative approach to Jacobean drama that enables reach fresh readings of both familiar and neglected plays in the period.

      EN646 - Image, Vision and Dream: Medieval Texts and  Visual Culture

      
      
       This module explores the complex relationships between written and visual culture, the latter including both artefacts such as paintings and sculpture, and the products of visual imagination such as dreams and visions.  We will ask questions such as: Can images really be innocent representations, or are they always replete with social, political and ideological significations?  In what ways might we 'read' images in order to recover those significations?  Where text and images appear together, is the relationship between them hierarchical, or are other kinds of relationship possible?  How might we blur the boundaries between text and image, for example in the case of narrative images, or descriptive and imagistic texts?  The rich textual and visual culture of the Middle Ages is used as a starting point, a lens through which you will have the opportunity to explore these questions from a range of angles, including the semiotic theories developed by Barthes as well as more traditional art-historical approaches.  We will explore texts from a variety of genres, including dream poetry and religious vision, alongside images in manuscripts, wall paintings, stained glass and sculpture.  The project element of the assessment offers you the opportunity to undertake independent research on any aspect of the module you choose (whether medieval or not); topics chosen in recent years have ranged from an exploration of meaning in medieval maps to a study of the iconography employed by Lady Gaga in videos and other publicity materials.

      EN655 - Places and Journeys

      
      
       This module explores what fascinates travellers and writers about both familiar and far-flung places. London, Istanbul, Cairo; roads, railways, and rivers; oceans, deserts, and deepest England: each place or mode of travel will be investigated as a source of inspiration, fantasy, and desire. How do invention and authenticity jostle for precedence in fictional as well as factual travel? Does travel writing reveal more about the places visited or the subjectivities of the writers? We will focus on modern writers with glances back to historical precursors. Writers studied should include Jack Kerouac, Orhan Pamuk, Iain Sinclair, Che Guevara, Paul Bowles, Gautam Malkani, Edward Said, Patrick Wright.

      EN656 - Heroes and Exiles: An Introduction to Old English Poetry

      
      
       In July 2009 a treasure-hunter unearthed the most significant hoard of Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever discovered in the British Isles: the Staffordshire Hoard.  The size and diversity of this treasure promises to reveal new insights into Anglo-Saxon life and culture.  But artefacts alone do not tell us everything; to get closer to the minds of those who made and used such items we need to recover the words of the Anglo-Saxons themselves, and this module, with its focus on the small but rich corpus of Old English Poetry, does exactly that.  This is a culture in which pagan and Christian ideals were melded together in ways quite unexpected to the modern mind.  We will discover a preoccupation with heroic deeds of warfare, and a desire to be remembered across the generations for feats of courage; we will also encounter a fear of being isolated from God, and the terrible sense of loss and longing of those who find themselves exiled from their lands and loved ones.  We will read a range of Old English poetry in modern English translations, setting it alongside manuscripts and images of artefacts to consider the ways in which the poetry both reflected and helped to shape Anglo-Saxon culture.  There will be the opportunity to engage at a very introductory level with the Old English language (no previous experience necessary), in order that we can explore the challenges of translating this complex and dazzling poetry into modern English.  The importance attached to the presentation element of assessment reflects the oral nature of Anglo-Saxon poetic culture.  Throughout the term you will receive help and advice on preparing for the presentation, and there will be opportunities to practise anad develop your presentations skills informally.

      EN657 - The Brontes in Context

      
      
       While the so-called Bront&euml; myth remains potent in popular culture today, the lives-and-works model associated with it continues to encourage readers to seek partially concealed Bront&euml; sisters in their fictions. Beginning and ending with the problematic of mythmaking  its origins in Gaskells 'Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;' and its subsequent perpetuation in film and other rewritings - this module will restore attention to the rich literary contribution made by the sisters through an intensive focus on their novels and selected poetry in the context of Victorian debates about gender and the woman question. Situating the Bront&euml;  myth in relation to other forms of mythmaking in the period (for example, ideologies of class, gender and empire), it will consider a small selection of film adaptations and go on to examine the Bront&euml;ss experiments with narrative voice and form, their variations upon the novel of education, the tensions between romance and realism in their writing and their engagement with religious and philosophical questions as well with the political, economic and social conditions of women in mid-Victorian culture. We will also consider a range of modern creative and critical engagements with the Bront&euml;s' literary works..

       This module explores the history and practice of crime fiction in the United States, from the detective stories of Edgar Allen Poe in the 1840s through the evolution of hardboiled narratives in the early and mid-twentieth century, and on into the 21st century novel. Attention is also paid to developments in film and television which parallel those in fiction, such as the birth of film noir and the contemporary cop series. During the course of the term, our readings of crime fiction will be supported by critical and theoretical texts by Franco Moretti, Tzvetan Todorov and others. Topics we will address include the relationship between high and low culture, how and why genres evolve, and the ways in which crime fiction addresses questions of race and gender

      EN660 - Writing Lives in Early Modern England: Diaries, Letters and Secret Selv

      
      
       Who wrote about their lives while Shakespeare was writing his plays and Queen Elizabeth was on the throne? Why did they do it, how and by whom did they intend their writing to be read, and what sort of things did they think were interesting about their lives? This module introduces you to the variety of sources available for exploring early modern life writing. Studying better- against less well-known texts (e.g. Anne Cliffords Diary and Shakespeares plays; early modern wills, letters and recipe books), and literary works alongside more pragmatic writings, the module will offer you an opportunity to investigate the private thoughts of the men and women of this crucial period of English history. Writing Lives is for anyone who has ever thought, even briefly, about keeping a diary  it encourages you to consider big questions like the nature of writing; the status of individuality; the forms which identity might take; but also stranger questions such as how the way you wrote a letter might have related to Hamlets To be or not to be speech.

      EN661 - The Stranger

      
      
       This module takes the figure of the stranger as a starting point for exploring the different ideas and contexts of belonging that have shaped the novel over the last century.  Contexts will include modernity and the Holocaust, race and gender in modern America, and contemporary fictions of exile and encounter.  Among the writers considered will be Joseph Conrad, Toni Morrison, and J M Coetzee.  The course will also draw on a variety of twentieth-century cultural, social and psychological conceptions of belonging, from the work of Sigmund Freud through to the more recent ideas of Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and Zygmunt Bauman.

       This module will trace the development of Chaucers literary reputation from his own attempts to forge an authorial legacy to his posthumous instantiation as The Father of English Poetry.  Some of the works of a generation of fifteenth-century followers who addressed Chaucer as a pioneer in vernacular poetry will be read alongside their adaptations of Chaucerian texts and literary techniques. The module will also explore the Chaucerian apocrypha, and assess what these additions to Chaucers literary corpus tell us about the authors fifteenth-century reception. The module will go on to follow some of the history of Chaucer in print, before assessing more modern appropriations of Chaucer in cinema, television and online media.

      EN667 - Harlem to Hogan's Alley: Black Writing in North America

      
      
       This module will bring together works of poetry and fiction by a number of black writers in the USA and Canada in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With a particular emphasis on migration, music, and urban space, we will explore the intellectual, political, and aesthetic imperatives that drive these writers to address questions of race, ethnicity, gender, belonging, representation, poverty, privilege, and trauma. Beginning in Harlem in the 1920s, the moment when the Negro was in vogue, students will examine the ways in which black Americans and Canadians have sought to make their impact on the literary landscape, by turns exposing and employing the power structures of the dominant culture. This comparative look at US and Canadian literatures, however, also challenges students to scrutinize the construction of literary and other categories, and to consider the commonality and distinctive difference between black experience north and south of the 49th parallel. Lectures/workshops will emphasise discussion of key moments and movements in African American / African Canadian arts; the significance of linguistic distinctiveness; the cultural self-categorisation of black, African American, Africadian and Halfrican identities; and the rise of African American literary theory.

      EN668 - Discovery Space: New Theatres in Early Modern England

      
      
       This module introduces students to the drama of Shakespeare's time, thinking in particular about the new theatrical buildings and the discoveries they made possible. The module encourages independent study and is consequently built around student interests as they develop their own research questions and essay topic.This period saw the emergence of the first permanent purpose built playhouses, and the development of the theatre industry.  We will consider how the conditions of performance and production  such as playhouse architecture, the reportorial system, printing, censorship and Londons changing urban environment  affected playwrights, actors and audiences. Reading a range of playwrights, students will get a sense of the main trends which shaped the drama of the time, contextualising their understanding of canonical writers such as Shakespeare. Students will also engage with the current developments in early modern theatre history and the ways in which thinking about authorship, staging, printing and other key concepts from the period has altered over the last fifty years. As part of this work, we will examine the phenomena of modern reconstructed playhouses such as Shakespeares Globe, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse and the American Shakespeare Centres Blackfriars, asking what - if anything - modern performance in these spaces can tell us about early modern practices.Office hours will support students in their independent work towards a long essay, whilst weekly two hour seminars will emphasise key moments in the period which will inform the individual interests of all students. Alongside the weekly seminar, the third hour of teaching will be used for workshops, screenings, directed reading/research group meetings and field tips.

      EN676 - Cross-Cultural Coming-of-Age Narratives

      
      
       If the Bildungsroman has been criticised for being outmoded and conservative, how do contemporary writers interrogate and expand its scope and importance? Are coming-of-age narratives merely private stories or can they be read in ways which highlight their social functions, and what kind of theoretical, aesthetic and cultural perspectives can we apply to scrutinise these functions? This module will bring together a range of texts and films from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that can be read within and against the literary tradition of the Bildungsroman or the coming-of-age narrative. Drawing on material from the US, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe, we will spend time analysing the representation of the coming-of-age experience in terms of content and form and assess the ideological functions of the Bildungsroman in a cross-cultural context. Particular attention will be given to questions of racial and ethnic identity, migration, colonialism, memory, trauma, belonging and sexuality. We will also explore the connection of the Bildungsroman with genres such as autobiography, memoir, young adult fiction, travel narrative, graphic novel, and film.

      EN669 - Marriage, Desire and Divorce in Early Modern Literature

      
      
       This module focuses on the theory and practice of marriage and divorce in early modern England and its treatment in the literature of the period. Examining a wide range of texts (drama, poetry, prose works and domestic handbooks alongside documentary sources such as wills, legal records and letters), it will explore the ways in which representations of marriage and its breakdown both reflected and informed the roles of men and women in early modern society. The relationships between discourses about gender, politics and the historical evidence about men and women's married lives in the period will be explored both through reading in the extensive secondary literature of gender, women's history and masculinity as well as through the study of primary sources such as wills, court records, advice books, popular literature (ballads and pamphlets, for example), literary texts (poems, plays and tracts), diaries and personal memoirs and material objects such as wedding rings and scolds bridles, for example. From Shakespeare and Fletcher's dramas of happy and unhappy marriage and Spenser's poetry of marital bliss,  to argument surrounding men and women's roles in marriage in the poetry and pamphlets of Milton and his contemporaries, we will also go in search of the personal accounts of women and men's experiences of marriage and its breakdown and the material artefacts which are testament to them.

      EN670 - Lyric, Ballad and Popular Song

      
      
       This course looks at how British and American popular song has been collected and transformed by literary professionals (particularly poets and academics) from the eighteenth century to the present day. The focus of the module is on poetry that has its origins in vernacular traditions of ballad singing, but its purview takes in all sorts of writings that are apt to be sung, or that have the vocal/lyrical medium as a significant element of their textual identity. The course is structured as a historical survey, tracing succeeding attempts by collectors, academics, poets and singers to preserve and to adapt such songs. It progresses from eighteenth-century and romantic-period ballad collectors such as Thomas Percy and Walter Scott, through revivalists such as Francis James Child, Lady Gregory, Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp, to contemporary popular musicians who draw on oral sources, such as Bob Dylan and P.J. Harvey. Students will be encouraged to consider how the figure of the singer and the act of singing have been used by poets (Gray, McPherson, Wordsworth, Dickinson, Hardy, Yeats, Gurney, Auden, Bishop) in figurative representations both of the inherited component of literary culture, and of the sublime (or otherwise ineffable) component of their particular art, poetry. Through discussions of theoretical texts students will be encouraged to consider the contrasting functions of poetic language from the perspectives of speech, lyric, narrative and vocalized song. The broad aims of the course are to help students find a critical idiom through which to describe the textual interdependence of inscribed, vocalized and musical articulations; to trace historical changes in that relationship; and to understand the ideological contexts of those changes in succeeding ages of nation-building, of empire, of world war, and of globalization.

      EN684 - Clouds, Waves & Crows: Writing the Natural, 1800 to the Present

      
      
       This module will look at a variety of texts, in a variety of forms, from the early nineteenth century to the present.  The poems, essays, novels, films, paintings and autobiographies all engage with and question our relationship to the world around us.  They sometimes look at nature, but more often ask what it is, what do we use it for, what is our relationship to it, what does it mean for us, what do we make it mean and to what ends, or what is the role that language plays in creating or representing our role in the world? Moreover, while nature may be seen to be something out there the module seeks to ask how it is connected to our understanding of identity, history, or sexuality.The module is not arranged around primary creative texts, and their theoretical accompaniments, but has a more ecological approach to the idea of the creative/critical boundary which means that some weeks core texts may be theoretical ones (such as John Grays Straw Dogs).  This approach is reflected in the modes of assessment where students are invited to produce either two essays, or one traditionally critical one, and one work of creative non-fiction that may encompass aspects of memoir, poetry, psychogeography or philosophy.

       Poetry and Crisis will tell a history of twentieth-century poetry through the lens of the major political events that have shaped it. Addressing key social issues including economic crisis, class, nation, war and postcolonialism, the module will investigate both key figures in the history of mainstream poetic tradition (W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Derek Walcott) and more experimental and collaborative movements such as proletarian realism, Language Poetry and art associated with the Occupy movement. Within these traditions, students will explore the possible ways in which poetry can be said to articulate, respond to and intervene in political crisis.

       Saints were a central feature of the Christian religion in medieval Europe, and they also had a profound influence on culture and society. This module explores the development of the cult of saints from Late Antiquity to the eve of the Reformation. Some of the main topics that will be considered include relics, miracle stories, pilgrimage, and artistic production. In addition to these topics, the module will consider the impact that saints and relics had on the building of churches and the feast days in the calendar. We will look at a wide variety of sources including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, stained glass, church buildings, and saints lives. All texts will be read in translation.

       This module deals with social, economic and cultural changes in late-medieval England, between c.1250 and 1450. It was a watershed period in English history, marking the beginning of the collapse of the old feudal order and the emergence of a new socio-economic regime, which paved the way to the world we know today. The topics include, but are not limited to: manorial system, peasant society, the Great Famine of 1315-17, the Black Death, the 1381 Revolt, changes in consumption culture, the emergence of popular preachers, and the rise of gentry.

       This module addresses the politics, ideology and culture of the USSR in the post-war era. It starts with an exploration of late Stalinism, before covering Khrushchev's reforms, Brezhnevs neo-Stalinism and Gorbachev's perestroika. Along with these themes, time will be devoted to: the intelligentsia; labour camps and the release of detainees in the 1950s; Soviet science; religion and spirituality; emerging nationalism; the Human Rights Movement; village prose; the Soviet economy; foreign policy and policy in the near abroad; the collapse of the USSR; and Yeltsins reformism and the new Russian state. The approach is interdisciplinary, and this will be reflected in the wide range of primary sources used; and throughout the module students will be introduced to the relevant historiography.

      HI6061 - Human Experiments & Human Rights during the  Cold War

      
      
       This Special Subject examines the history of human rights in human experimentation during the Cold War, and traces the development of biological and chemical warfare research from the Second World War through to Allied military research in the 1950s and 1960s. It charts continuity and change in the development of medical ethics standards in modern military research on humans, and assesses the extent to which research subjects were informed of the risks involved in the research. The module explores Allied war-time research and the international response to news of Nazi medical atrocities. The Nuremberg Medical Trial and the Nuremberg Code are important milestones in the history of informed consent and modern medical ethics. The module looks at the nuclear testing programme that was conducted by the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1950s, and investigates in detail the evolving chemical warfare programme at Porton Down in the United Kingdom where one of the servicemen, Ronald Maddison, died from exposure to the nerve agent sarin in 1953. The history of research into incapacitants and biological warfare agents is located into a wider context of an evolving system of medical ethics in which non-therapeutic experiments without consent were increasingly seen as unethical and unlawful. Finally, the attempts by veteran groups for recognition and compensation will be examined as part of a wider political history of the Cold War which has shaped our understanding and memory of the more recent past.

        This module will study the political, religious and social history of England, and also English relations with Wales, Ireland and Scotland in the context of the unification of Britain. The theme of the integration of the realm will be traced from the Yorkist foundation of the councils in the North of England, and in the Marches of Wales, to the creation of Great Britain in the reform debates, the control of the periphery by the centre and the unification of the British Isles under James VI and I. Within this framework subjects such as the royal courts of Renaissance England, the rather different impact of the Reformation in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, the Tudor commonwealth, plantations in Ireland and North America will be examined in the context of the emergence of the sovereignty of the King in Parliament.

       This module puts together the methods of literature and history.  Its case studies come from nineteenth-century science, as it is in this area of scholarship in which some of the most exciting and stimulating historicist scholarship has arisen of late.  The first term will be spent on a review of various approaches to literature and history, from textual to contextual, taking in, for example, the narrative turn, reception theory and reader-centred studies.  This will be partnered with a slow and in-depth reading of two nineteenth-century texts that have spawned most historicist scholarship in literature and science: most likely George Eliots Middlemarch and Charles Darwins Origin of Species (tbc).  In the second term, students will choose a selection of novels (one per week) for study within the framework of methodologies covered in term 1.  Students will be guided and advised in their choices, which are anticipated to lie in the realm of nineteenth or possibly twentieth-century science.  Students will develop two of their chosen texts for independent research, assessed by means of substantial essays.

      HI6044 - British Politics 1625-1642

      
      
       When Charles I became king of England in March 1625, he also inherited the thrones of Scotland and Ireland. This module will consider politics, religion and culture in Caroline Britain from Charles Is assumption of the triple crown, until he declared war on the English Parliament in August 1642. During this fascinating period, the king pursued controversial policies and eventually faced armed resistance in all three kingdoms  the struggle against the Scottish covenanters (1639-40); the Irish rebellion (1641); and finally, civil war in England (1642). Students will have the opportunity to analyse a wide variety of primary source material, including royal letters, private correspondence, paintings, journals, newsletters, religious documents and state papers. Through these rich sources, students will explore the many factors which shaped the character of Charless government and will be encouraged to draw their own conclusions about the nature and success of the kings approach. Was this a period of relative harmony until the late 1630s or were all three kingdoms on a trajectory towards conflict from the outset of the reign? By the end of the module, students will be able to answer these, and other historiographical questions, including perhaps the most crucial question of all - what were the causes of the British Civil Wars?

      HI6049 - The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the Atlantic World, c. 1500 - 1900

      
      
       This source-based class confronts two of the most sophisticated and contentious historiographical debates of the last century: the so-called Origins Debate about the role of race in the entrenchment of slavery in America in the 17th and 18th centuries and the debates about the place of capitalism in explanations for the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. The course will also confront the role played by political and constitutional change in the development and dismantling of the slave system. Students will consider the character and place of slavery within European and American economic, political, and cultural development. The course will examine the conditions under which slave societies emerged; the part played by empire, and the distinctive combination of ideological and theological strands that produced a compelling challenge to slavery for the first time. It challenges participants to examine the utility, in this context, of such historiographical motifs as: race, slavery (as distinct from the slave trade), liberty, empire, capitalism, mercantilism, humanitarianism, as well as the separation between economics and politics in the development and abolition of slavery. As such, it exposes participants to the history of race, cultural history, intellectual history, political, imperial, and economic history, all within the context of the Atlantic experience. With constant attention to the problem of accommodating slavery within comparatively liberal cultures and societies, this course navigates students through much of modern American, European history, and African history.

       The study of war has, until recently, tended to focus upon leaders, combatants and military strategies. This course, however, will analyse the experience of civilians on the Home Front, using World War Two Britain as a case study. Sessions will typically include:Sources for Studying the Home Front 1) propaganda posters, film and radio; 2) Mass Observation; and personal testimonies; the Blitz spirit; The Enemy Within: Enemy Aliens and Jews; Minority groups on the home front: Travellers and Immigrants; Womens war service; Cultural representations of women; Soldier heroes and civilian men; Cultural representations of men; Evacuating the home front; Brief Encounters; Politics I: social policies; Politics II: a swing to the left?; and the impact of war on the home front: change and continuity. There will also normally be a trip to the Imperial War Museum.

      HI6039 - The Rights Revolution: The 20th Century US   Supreme Court & Society

      
      
       This course will look at the central theme of the "Rights Era"- the move in the U. S. from a customary deference to tradition and view of the mainstream to the enforcement of political equality with far less regard for mainstream views. It will examine competing views of what "equality" means and consider the numerous groups that have demanded it since 1945 and the way they both fought for their causes and created the turbulence and confrontation in American society after 1960. These groups include, but are not limited to, African Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women, the disabled, certain religious groups, those who have faced discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, as well as other groups that followed similar legal strategies, such as environmentalists and those who seek greater guarantees of property rights, free speech rights, and gun rights. This not only is an essential topic for understanding the modern United States but as UK is currently undergoing similar legal changes, it has meaning for contemporary Britain.  This course assumes no prior knowledge of American law or of the courts in the United States. It can also include subjects of interest to students not listed above, assuming sufficient materials are available on those topics. It aims to places this groups & their activities in the context of the time and show how the strategies worked (or failed) and the reaction of both elite and general opinion to the claims.

      HI6040 - The Discovery of the World c.1450 - 1800

      
      
       A century after the discovery of the Americas, in a treatise published in 1580, the radical Reformer Jacob Paleologus argued that it was most unlikely that the ancestors of the American natives could have crossed the Ocean and he concluded hence that all humans cannot descend from one single individual, Adam. So the discovery of America not only challenged traditional geographical knowledge, but also questioned fundamental religious, anthropological and historical assumptions. This module will explore early modern encounters with new worlds and with non-European cultures and it will ask about the impressions, which these encounters made and the manifold changes of European life they brought about. Based on the weekly reading of one primary source, we will follow travellers, merchants, scholars and missionaries on their expeditions to the inner parts of Africa, to the court of the Shah of Persia, to China and to the Americas. We will watch them drawing maps of uncharted lands and compose dictionaries of unheard languages. And we will not only listen to European voices, but will also try to reconstruct the experiences and impressions of non-European actors and visitors. The central aim of this module is to discuss the religious, intellectual, political and economical contexts of these discoveries and cultural encounters. We will ask how the various actors organized and methodized their expeditions and how they interpreted their discoveries. The module will also address the consequences, which these discoveries entailed. How did they affect the traditional European ideas about mankind, religion, the world and their position in it? How did they influence European life style, fashion, art and literature? How did they affect the lives, social structures and cultures of the discovered people?

      HI796 - Inviting Doomsday: US Environmental

      
      
       Condemned by the international community for refusing to sign the Kyoto Accords, rendered powerless by electricity blackouts, and stricken by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the United States of America is today embroiled in a narrative of environmental controversy and catastrophe. This module explores to what extent the USA has been inviting doomsday throughout the modern (twentieth-century) period. Commencing with an introductory session on writing and researching American environmental history, the module is then split into four sections: Science and Recreation, Doomsday Scenarios, Environmental Protest, and Consuming Nature. Over the twelve weeks we will consider a range of environmental issues that include wildlife management in national parks, pesticide spraying on prairie farms, nuclear testing in Nevada, and Mickey Mouse rides in Disneyland. By the end of the module, we will have constructed a comprehensive map of the United States based around themes of ecological transformation, assimilation and decay.

      HI6035 - Anglo-French Relations 1904 - 1945

      
      
       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

      HI6029 - The Great War: British Memory, History and   Culture

      
      
       The aim of this course will be to show how far the Great War has infiltrated into modern culture and to test the validity of Paul Fussell's thesis that the Great War created Britain's modern cultural atmosphere. Fussell contends that modern society is marked by a love of irony, paradox and contradiction formed by the experience of the Western Front. Against this theory we will set the ideas of Samuel Hynes and Martin Stephen, as argued in their works, A War Imagined and The Price of Pity. This course will explore how the Great War has influenced our lives and why we have certain images of it. Why, for example, do most people associate the Great War with words such as 'waste', 'futility' and 'disillusion'? Why does the morality of the Great War seem so tarnished, while the Second World War is conceived as a just war? The course will be based upon literature (high and popular), poetry, art, architecture and film. We will therefore be 'reading' a 'primary text' each week. The course will serve to highlight many of themes of the 19th and 20th century British survey courses and will further contextualise the course on Britain and the Home Front in the Second World War.

      HI6030 - Empires of Religion

      
      
       'At the height of the imperial age church people liked to argue that religion and the British empire were inseparable - that the visible, commercial and political empire was woven into the fabric of another, invisible country - a spiritual empire.' Hilary M Carey, Empires of Religion, p. 1.This module will critically interrogate Careys above assertion by asking how far can missionaries be considered agents of imperialism? In so doing it will interact with issues of how we define imperialism, how useful the idea of cultural imperialism can be to the modern historian, and how we might talk meaningfully about 'the colonising project'. Students will be introduced to the history of the British Empire and more broadly the history of British cultural engagement and encounters with indigenous peoples within and outside of the empire. You will analyse and discuss the socio-economic, cultural and religious impact of Christian mission in the 'age of expansion', and will tease out issues of cultural encounters, indigenous agency and resistance, race, racism and cultural chauvinism. We will explore the impact of mission literature and experience on the British public's own imaginative engagement with non-western peoples, and will use an exciting and diverse range of textual, visual and oral sources. Students will emerge with a complex understanding of colonialism, in all its variegated forms, and how it has shaped (and continues to shape) the modern world in which we live today.

      HI764 - How the West Was Won (or Lost): The American West in the Nineteenth Cen

      
      
       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation. The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis. Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars. Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape. A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion. Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates. Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

      HI6024 - Napoleon and Europe, 1799 - 1815

      
      
       A decade ago John Dunne, in a review article, described Napoleonic history as a poor relation of the French Revolution that seemed on the verge of making good. These prophetic words described well the growing interest among scholars in Bonapartes ambitious Imperial mission extending beyond Frances natural frontiers. The work of historians Stuart Woolf and Michael Broers has postulated that the Napoleonic mission to 'integrate Europe under a single system of governance' could be viewed as a form of 'cultural imperialism in a European setting.' This special subject will introduce students to the pros and cons of this historiographical debate. It will give final year students an alternative means of engaging with the familiar historical category of Empire. There is no shortage of source material translated into English relating to this period. Indeed the memorial de Saint Helene has been available to the Anglophone world since 1824. Consequently a critical and in-depth engagement with primary material will be one of the priorities of this special subject. The focus on French expansion abroad, in the early nineteenth century, challenges one to move away from understanding the Napoleonic Empire in national terms; this course in essence, by its very nature, is European in both scope and content. To do this it will explore processes of acculturation and international competition on a thematic basis. It will examine, in broad multi-national manner, the complex interaction between centre and periphery or what Italians, more prosaically, describe as conflict between stato reale and stato civile. Napoleon was his own best advocate when it came to forging his posthumous legacy. Students will be encouraged to appraise critically his memoirs and understand that behind claims of progress lay a brutal struggle for the fiscal military resources of Europe. Yet, even more important will be to consider that while the military and political effects of the grand Empire were ephemeral, it created a judicial and administrative edifice which survived well beyond 1815 and continues to shape European civilisation to this day. Of course, laws do not merely structure the powers of governmental action but have a complex impact on notions of citizenship, the economy and culture (especially family life). This special subject will investigate the Napoleonic Empire in its many facets. Students will be urged actively to pursue their individual interests in either war and society, Empire, political culture and/or gender.

      HI5032 - African History since 1800

      
      
       This module is meant to introduce students to the key processes and dynamics of sub-Saharan African history during the past two centuries. The course covers three chronological periods: the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. In their study of the pre-colonial period students, will especially familiarize themselves with the changing nature of African slavery and the nineteenth-century reconstruction of political authority in the face of economic, environmental and military challenges. The colonial period forms the second section of the course. Here, students will gain an understanding of the modalities of the colonial conquest, the creation and operation of colonial economies and the socio-cultural engineering brought about by European rule. The study of the colonial period will end with an analysis of African nationalisms and decolonisation. In the final part of the course, students will develop an understanding of the challenges faced by independent African nations. The nature of the post-colonial African state will be explored alongside such topical issues as the Rwandan Genocide and the African AIDS epidemic.

       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

      HI6014 - Riders on the Storm

      
      
       The module will study the economic, environmental, social and political crisis of the fourteenth century, which had a long-term impact on the population of the British Isles and beyond. The fourteenth century was a troublesome period in European history. After some two centuries of economic growth, demographic expansion and relative social stability, Europe entered the era of harsh socio-economic crises, bio-ecological shocks, climatic deterioration and political turmoil. The ubiquitous Four Riders of the Apocalypse, as seen by the contemporaries, brought much hardship upon all strata of European society. The Black Death of 1348-51, whose nature is still debatable, killed about 40 per cent of British population and altered the land-to-labour ratio, leading to far-reaching social and economic changes within the society. Violent and costly wars of England against Scotland and France commanded increased taxation, caused supply shock, high transaction costs and hence high prices and low real wages. Between 1314 and 1322, there was a series of failed harvests, brought about by continuous torrential rain and exceptionally cold winters. This agrarian crisis, or the Great Famine, caused starvation and malnourishment, chiefly among the lower echelons of the society. The famine spread chaos and anarchy over the country, with crime rates going up. To these should be added another significant biological crisis: mass cattle mortality of panzootic proportions, which ravaged the whole of Northern Europe and decimated its bovine stocks. This period can be regarded as truly a watershed one in British, and European history, and there is no doubt that it has changed the existing economic and social order forever.This module will look at each and every of these crises and at the interaction between them. A particular attention will be given to reading primary sources, shedding much light on our understanding of these crises. In addition, each class will involve a reading and discussion of one scholarly work (an article, or a book chapter) related to the subject.1. An introduction to the Fourteenth-Century Crisis: themes, sources and problems2. In the wake of the storm: thirteenth-century prosperity and growth3. The problem of overpopulation in Europe c.1300: Malthusian Crisis?4. The famine of 1315-21: the worst subsistence crisis in the West ever recorded?5.

      HI5024 - The American Civil War Era 1848-1877

      
      
       This course will examine this key era of US history by examining the key political and social events, developments in the history of ideas and historiographical controversies from the victory over Mexico to the final withdrawal of US troops from the South. It will focus on the changes that occurred and the changing interpretations of them. Students will be able to see the interplay of forces and ideas that led to a conflict that few, if any, wanted and lasted for longer than anyone expected. Historical and fictional depictions in art and film will be evaluated for the ways they shape perspectives. The key historical topics include the rise of slavery as a public issue in the late 1840s, the attempts to find compromise within the Constitutional framework, the activities of the extremists, the changing nature and goals of the war, the effects the war had on both sides, the plans for the post-war period, the changing elite and popular attitudes, the nature of the final, pragmatic arrangements that the country accepted. Students will be able to pursue topics of their choice alongside and as part of these themes.

      HI5022 - Science, Power and Politics in Twentieth Century Britain

      
      
       This module covers the period approximately 1900-79 and follows the fortunes of H. G. Wells open conspiracy  his scheme by which scientists would rule the world.  The aim is to understand what scientists (and their friends and critics) thought was the social role of science during this period, and how they sought to make sure that science played that role.  We aim to find out why scientists thought a scientific approach to life and society was desirable; how they sought to impose it; and to what extent, or in what ways, they were successful in their aims.  Along the way we will see how scientists engaged with particular political ideologies, and with the government.  Examples covered include the poverty vs. ignorance nutrition debate during the great depression, the development of nuclear power and consumer technology at the Festival of Britain.  We will see the pivotal role played by WWII in terms of facilitating scientists ambitions to govern, and the rise of psychology as arguably the most influential science in terms of governance.  The module makes particular use of fictional and documentary film sources as a means to understand the place of science in public culture.
