       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      CB523 - International Business

      
      
       The internationalisation of commerce and the worlds capital markets has spurred a growing interest in impact and success of foreign business entities in the home country. Many business decisions are influenced by global events and constrained by international institutions, and naive thinking about international politics, economics, cultures, exchange rates and foreign competitors can quickly have an adverse effect on a firm.The module aims to provide an understanding of the complex environment in which international business takes place and the ways companies deal with these challenges. The module is taught in two parts. The first part examines the political, economic and cultural environments that affect business. It also explores the determinants of national competitive advantage, the role of government and trade regulations in conducting business, the impact of regional integration and of international organisations such as the IMF and the WTO, the motives and the impact of multinational enterprises. The second part is dedicated to analysing the ways in which international business performs main functions such as human resource management, marketing and finance in an international context. Furthermore, international negotiations issues, corporate social responsibility and the relevance of e-business to international business are discussed. Case studies are used throughout the module in order to link theory and practice.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CB688 - Decision Analysis

      
      
       Making decisions is one of the most important things any manager or business must do. Making smart decisions, however, can be extremely difficult due the complexity and uncertainty involved. Decision Analysis (DA) provides a structured and coherent approach to decision making. It involves a wide range of quantitative and graphical methods for identifying, representing, and assessing alternatives in order to determine a best course of action. DA is regularly employed by many leading companies in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, utilities, automotive, and financial services sectors. In this module, you learn about the basic concepts of DA and how to apply it in a variety of practical business planning situations. An indicative list of topics is provided below. Introduction to decision making: understanding why decisions are hard, the art of making good decisions, the main building blocks of structured decision making. Decision trees: a walk through of the construction and use of decision trees for graphically representing and analysing risky decision problems. Expected value decision criterion: a short introduction to probability theory, how to compute expected values, and the use of an expected value decision criteria for solving decision trees. Alternative decision criteria: different types of risk attitude and a brief overview of alternative decision criteria for incorporating risk attitude. Overview of utility theory: a critical look at expected value and potential problems with using it, the concept of utility and the elicitation of a utility function, the exponential utility function for modelling risk neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking decision makers. Dominance and sensitivity analysis: deterministic and stochastic dominance, tornado diagrams, one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis of probability estimates. Value of information: information and decision making, value of perfect information, value of sample information. Multi-criteria decision making: the analytical hierarchy process, comparing attributes, scoring alternatives, ranking alternatives, checking for consistency.

      CB658 - Diversity in Organisations

      
      
       This module presents an overview of what workforce diversity is and its relevance and usefulness in improving our understanding and management of people (including ourselves) at work. The demographics of the population and the workplace are changing drastically because of a number of factors, such as an increasing number of ethnic minorities and women in the workforce and in management. Accordingly, there is a need to effectively understand and manage workforce diversity not only to increase organisational business outcomes but also to create an inclusive workplace in a socially responsible manner. The module will examine issues confronting managers of a diverse workforce. In particular issues such as ethnicity, race, language, ageing, disability, gender, and intersectional identities will be discussed. Two key approaches towards managing diversity will be explained, i.e. the social equity case of managing diversity, and the business benefits case of managing diversity. The module will explore a range of diversity related concepts and topics, such as social identity, stereotyping, discrimination, intergroup conflict, structural integration, and organisational change. Main themes covered by this module will include:Origins of diversity and equal opportunity in the workplace context;Social and psychological perspectives on workplace diversity;The UK and European diversity contexts;Business benefits case and social equity case of managing diversity; The legal framework for diversity;Organisational approaches to diversity;Contemporary issues central to the experiences of diverse individuals in the UK and in organisations across a range of diversity dimensions;Diversity management in an international context

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.
