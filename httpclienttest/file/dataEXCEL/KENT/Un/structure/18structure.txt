Course structure


The International Foundation programme is a modular course taught over three terms, starting in September or January. All students take one module in Skills and Academic English and either take a module in English for Academic Study or complete a project. The Skills and Academic English classes differ from 'English language' classes as you will be working to develop skills to fully enjoy your academic experience in the UK. These include, for example, developing your sense of responsibility in seminar/ group work and as an independent student, improving your skills in time management, project management, and developing your analytical and critical skills.

You then choose three other modules from the list below, depending on your chosen pathway:

 Analogue Electronics
