Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.


 Foundation year

 
  The course structure is fixed and there are no optional modules.   Modules are taught in four-day workshops at Canterbury (Monday through to Thursday 0930-1630hrs for years one and two).   The modules listed below show the structured path designed in conjunction with employers.   Each year, students work with at least two children or adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities.   Most students continue to work part-time or are seconded by their employers. We often make an employment reference a condition of entry.   Each year is structured so the work in one module builds on the work of a previous module. To proceed into the following year, each module must be passed.
