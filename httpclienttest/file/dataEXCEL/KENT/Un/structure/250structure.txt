      MA629 - Probability and Inference

      
      
       This module develops the techniques introduced in the first year probability and statistics modules, and lays the foundation for several third year statistics modules. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations.  The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module.  Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  All of these have been introduced in the first year statistics module.  The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation.  Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, etc.  Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables.  Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution.  Principles of statistical inference.  Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency).  Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments.  Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test.  Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.

      MA632 - Regression Models

      
      
       The aims of the module are to introduce the students to the theory and practice of regression, and associated linear model techniques. Quite often experimenters and researchers wish to express a response variable y as a function of some other (explanatory) variables. For example, y might be the yield of a chemical process and the explanatory variables might be temperature and pressure. Knowing the relationship would enable y to be predicted for particular values of temperature and pressure. In this module the method of deriving such a relationship will be that of least squares and the theoretical and practical aspects of this method will be covered in some detail. There will be opportunity for students to use computer programs.The module covers most of the following topics: definition of the linear model and regression, least squares estimates, sums of squares, expectations, properties of estimators, the ANOVA table, standard errors and confidence intervals for parameters, residuals, diagnostics, regression with two explanatory variables, matrix formulation of the model, multiple regression, extra sum of squares principle, use of MINITAB, model selection strategies, introduction to analysis of variance.

      MA574 - Polynomials in Several Variables

      
      
       This module provides a rigorous foundation for the solution of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  In the 1890s, David Hilbert proved four ground-breaking theorems that prepared the way for Emmy Noether's famous foundational work in the 1920s on ring theory and ideals in abstract algebra.  This module will echo that historical progress, developing Hilbert's theorems and the essential canon of ring theory in the context of polynomial rings.  It will take a modern perspective on the subject, using the Groebner bases developed in the 1960s together with ideas of computer algebra pioneered in the 1980s. The syllabus will be: Multivariate polynomials, monomial orders, division algorithm, Groebner basis; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and its meaning and consequences for solving polynomials in several variables; Elimination theory and applications; Linear equations over systems of polynomials, syzygies, discussion of Hilbert's Syzygies Theorem, its proof and applications. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other applications.  Depending on time, these may include: invariants of group actions, linear PDEs, combinatorics and the Stanley-Reisner ring, and algebraic codes.

      MA576 - Groups and Representations

      
      
       Groups arise naturally in many areas of mathematics as well as in chemistry and physics.  A concrete way to approach groups is by representing them as groups of matrices, in which explicit computations are easy.  This approach has been very fruitful in developing our understanding of groups over the last century.This module will provide a rigorous introduction to the main ideas and notions of groups and representations.  It will also have a strong computational strand: a large part of the module will be devoted to explicit computations of representations and character tables (a table of complex numbers associated to any finite group).The syllabus will be as follows:(a) Groups: basic structure and examples (matrix groups, permutations), group actions;(b) A concrete approach to groups via representations;(c) Character tables: theory and computations for small groups;(d) Simple groups.Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other topics.  Depending on time, these may include some of the following examples: Platonic solids, Sylow Theorems, invariants of group actions, combinatorics, groups and cryptography.

      MA577 - Elements of Abstract Analysis

      
      
       In this module we build on the key analytical concepts of sequences, series, limits,and continuity developed in any first course on Real Analysis, and place them in the more general context of metric spaces. In the first part of the course fundamental notions of metric spaces, such as compactness and completeness, are discussed. Metric space theory underpins much of modern anaylisis and its applications. In the second part of the course we use techniques and theorems from metric spaces to discuss elements of Hilbert space theory. The course emphasizes formal definitions and proofs, and aims to enable you to place your previous knowledge of anaylsis in a much wider context.The syllabus will be taken from the following topics:(1) Metric space theory.  Definitions and examples of metric spaces, normed spaces, inner-product spaces. Balls, boundedness, open and closed sets.  Convergence, Cauchy sequences, completeness, and equivalence of metrics.  Completion of a metric space, uniform convergence, and exchanging limits.

Limit points, closure, boundary, separability, density.  Banach contraction mapping theorem; applications to ODE theory (Picard's theorem), and/or integral equations.  Continuity in metric spaces, uniform continuity, and continuity of linear mappings.  Compactness, sequential compactness, Heine-Borel, Non-compactness of balls in infinite dimensional normed spaces.  The spaces of continuous functions C(X) on a compact metric space X, and the Weierstrass approximation theorem. (2) Basic Hilbert space theory. Definitions and examples of inner-product spaces, Hilbert spaces, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, parallelogram identity, l2 and L2([a,b]).  Orthogonal complements and orthogonal projections.   Orthonormal sets and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation.  Examples of orthogonal polynomials, e.g., Legendre polynomials and/or Chebyshev polynomials.

      MA587 - Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

      
      
       Most differential equations which arise from physical systems can not be solved explicitly in closed form, and thus numerical solutions are an invaluable way to obtain information about the underlying physical system. The first half of the module is concerned with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several different numerical methods are introduced and error growth is studied. Both initial value and boundary value problems are investigated.  The second half of the module deals with the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The syllabus includes initial value problems for ODEs, Taylor methods, Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, error bounds and stability.  Boundary value problems for ODEs, shooting methods and finite difference schemes.  Partial Differential Equations, difference schemes, iterative methods, stability analysis and the method of lines.

      MA549 - Discrete Mathematics

      
      
       Recently, with the rapid developments in IT, in particular in electronic communication systems, some quite surprising new applications have been found for Discrete Mathematics (as opposed to the Continuous Mathematics based on the calculus). Thus methods for the encoding of information in order to safeguard against eavesdropping or distortion by noise have involved using some basic results from modular arithmetic, polynomial algebra and the theory of finite fields. The module will provide a self-contained introduction to this general area and will cover most of the following topics:(a)   Modular arithmetic, polynomials and finite fields: Applications to orthogonal Latin squares, RSA public key ciphers, coin-tossing over a telephone, linear feedback shift registers and m-sequences.(b)   Error correcting codes: Binary block, linear and cyclic codes including repetition, parity-check, Hamming, simplex; Reed-Muller - BCH - Golay - and other codes; channel capacity; Maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, syndrome and algebraic decoding.

       The module starts with an introduction to a range of atypical data sets, drawn from areas such as ecology, biology, genetics and psychology.  Each of the examples can be described by a suitable stochastic model, making use of the known background to the data, and built on the axioms of probability theory. Fitting models to data is traditionally accomplished by the method of maximum likelihood, and typically this involves numerical optimisation. The labour involved here is only feasible using a computer, and integral to the module is the use of the MATLAB integrated computer package. The module also describes modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, and MATLAB is again very useful for illustrating these methods in operation. In supervised computer practical classes you will gain experience with running a range of computer programs for modern methods of statistical analysis.  Students completing this module will possess an enviable grasp of the utility and power of modern statistics for describing real-life situations.  During the module you will cover most of the following topics: Introduction and examples. Model fitting by maximum likelihood. Function optimisation. Basic likelihood tools. Simulation techniques. Fundamental features of modelling. The EM algorithm. Generalised linear models, generalised linear mixed models. Bayesian methods. Note that this module makes excellent use of a wide range of statistical, mathematical and computational techniques, and revises and integrates material from a number of other lecture courses. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      MA772 - Analysis of Variance

      
      
       This module will build on the material on linear-models covered in the module, MA632 Regression.   Analysis of variance is a fundamentally important method for the statistical analysis of data.  It is used widely in biological, medical, psychological, sociological and industrial research.  In analysing experimental data, the appropriate form of analysis of variance is determined by the design of the experiment, and we shall therefore discuss some aspects of experimental design in this module.  Lectures are supplemented by computing classes which explore the analysis of variance facilities of the statistical package R. Syllabus: One-way ANOVA (fixed effects model); alternative models; least squares estimation; expectations of mean squares; distributional results; ANOVA table; follow-up analysis; multiple comparisons; least significant difference; confidence intervals; contrasts; orthogonal polynomials; checking assumptions; residual plots; Bartletts test; transformations; one-way ANOVA (random effects model); types of experiment; experimental and observational units; treatment structure; randomisation; replication; blocking; the size of an experiment; two-way ANOVA; the randomised complete block design; two-way layout with interaction; the general linear model; matrix formulation; models of full rank; constraints; motivations for using least squares; properties of estimators; model partitions; extra sum of squares principle; orthogonality; multiple regression; polynomial regression; comparison of regression lines; analysis of covariance; balanced incomplete block designs; Latin square designs; Youden rectangles; factorial experiments; main effects and interactions

      MA781 - Practical Multivariate Analysis

      
      
       Many statistical problems (in biology and psychology, for example) are multivariate, in that more than one measurement is made on each individual under study.  For example, we may be given scores on several different tests, or the levels of several chemicals in the blood.Some statistical techniques for analysing multivariate data are extensions of standard univariate techniques. Other techniques are concerned with the relationships between variables; they lead, in conjunction with modern computing techniques, to a wide variety of descriptive and exploratory tools.In this module, students will attend about 20 lectures and classes designed to introduce all the major concepts and techniques of multivariate analysis, and will do some reading and undertake a small project designed to deepen their appreciation of some of the methodology.Syllabus: Random variables and their properties; The Multivariate Normal (MN) distribution; Partial and multiple correlation; Sampling distributions based on MN; Inference for  the  MN  distribution; including  Hotelling's  T2 and multivariate analysis of variance; Likelihood ratio and Union-intersection methods; Discriminant analysis; Principal component analysis and Factor Analysis; Scaling and rotation of factors; Canonical analysis; Metric and non-metric scaling.  Methods of cluster analysis.

      MA599 - Mini-Projects

      
      
       Professional mathematicians employ a wide variety of skills when working on any one problem.  This module is designed to give students the opportunity to put their seemingly disparate skills together in a variety of ways and learn to communicate what they have done in an effective manner. Communication skills  both written and spoken  are at the heart of this module.This module  is assessed on the basis of the project work submitted (70%), coursework related to the project (20%), and coursework related to the communication skills component (10%). Students are arranged into small teams. Each group will work together, under the guidance of the project supervisor, to produce a single written project. In addition, each individual student will submit a short report detailing his/her contributions to the group project, and will have an interview where he/she will give a presentation and will answer questions on the project topic.Indicative titles for group projects:   ---  Orthogonal polynomials and special functions --- Integral inequalities and their applications ---  Chaos and the double pendulum --- Knots --- Chaos in one-dimensional maps --- Fractals ---  Generating functions --- Games and  Decisions   --- Public key cryptography  ---  Graph theory --- A Glimpse into Non-Standard Analysis  --- Origami and  Mathematics -- Symmetry Methods for Differential Equations --- Number theory ---  Fourier analysis --- Information theory and cryptography --- Smoker mortality and the effect on life insurance --- Population and financial projections --- Life insurance company product launch --- Modelling Financial Data with ARCH and GARCH models  --- Financial Statements Analysis.There will be a series of key skills workshops covering scientific writing, presentation skills, team-work and typesetting using LaTeX (including surgery hours for LaTeX ). 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
