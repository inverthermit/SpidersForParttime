Course structure


The International Foundation programme is a modular course taught over three terms, starting in September or January. All students take one module in Skills and Academic English and either take a module in English for Academic Study or complete a project. The Skills and Academic English classes differ from 'English language' classes as you will be working to develop skills to fully enjoy your academic experience in the UK. These include, for example, developing your sense of responsibility in seminar/ group work and as an independent student, improving your skills in time management, project management, and developing your analytical and critical skills.

You then choose three other modules from the list below, depending on your chosen pathway:

 Analogue Electronics
 Applied Chemistry
 Art   Design
 Business Management
 Economics
 Electrical Principles and Measurements
 Film, Drama and Literary Text
 Fundamentals of Human Biology
 Genetics and Evolution
 History
 Law
 Life Sciences
 Maths and Statistics
 Philosophy
 Politics
 Psychology
 Sociology

      BI324 - Genetics and Evolution

      
      
       This module is an introduction to Mendelian genetics and also includes human pedigrees, quantitative genetics, and mechanisms of evolution.Lectures/Workshops:GeneticsAn introduction to the genetics of a variety of organisms including Mendelian inheritance (monohybrid and dihybrid) and exceptions to the predicted outcomes due to incomplete dominance, co-dominance, lethal alleles, epistasis and genetic linkage, the chromosomal basis of inheritance, organelle based inheritance and epistasis. The inheritance of human genetic disease and its investigation by human pedigree analysis will also be introduced. Bacterial genetics.Evolution The nature of mutation, including molecular mechanisms leading to the mutation of DNA,  and the role of both mutation and horizontal gene transfer in evolution. Historical views on evolution, Darwins observations, the fossil record to modern techniques. Microevolution, population genetics and analysis of the distribution of genes within populations and  mechanisms of gene flow, genetic drift, selection and speciation.

      LZ035 - Foundation Project

      
      
       Through this module, students will develop the transferable academic skills necessary to successfully complete all the other modules on the IFP and to succeed on their future undergraduate programme. The programme of study will cover critical and analytical skills in both written and spoken format. Students will attend three two-hour seminar/workshops per week on project management and academic skills and meet with their tutor four to five times during the workshops for a one-to-one tutorial, to discuss their project and progress on the module. Students will create an electronic Portfolio consisting of reflective journal entries based on the progression of their project (with the use of a Wiki), which will be assessed throughout the module, then deliver a presentation of their Portfolio at the end of the module. Students will also present an oral proposal of their project midway through the term. At the end of the term, students will submit their complete Project Essay. Students' entry language level (e.g. IELTS score) will determine whether they take LZ035 Foundation Project in the second term; students with an entry score equivalent to IELTS = 6.0 will complete LZ036 Academic Skills Development in the first term and then take LZ035 Foundation Project in the second term. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      LZ036 - Academic Skills Development

      
      
       Through this module, students will develop the transferable linguistic and academic skills necessary to successfully complete all the other modules on the IFP.  The programme of study will cover academic writing, reading, speaking and listening skills. Students entry language level (e.g. IELTS score) will determine whether they take LZ037 English for Academic Study in the first term and LZ026 in the second (IELTS

      LZ037 - English for Academic Study

      
      
       Through this module, students will develop the transferable linguistic and academic skills necessary to successfully complete all the other modules on the IFP.  The programme of study focuses on grammar, vocabulary and academic writing skills. The module begins with an intensive revision of language structures and goes on to embed these structures into academic writing. Students will learn key steps in the writing process and be introduced to a range of written academic genres. Throughout the module, students will also develop their academic vocabulary through reading and writing tasks specially designed for this.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).
