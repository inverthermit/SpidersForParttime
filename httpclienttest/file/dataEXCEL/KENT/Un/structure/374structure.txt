 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      HI426 - Making History: Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module has two aims: 1) to contribute towards equipping the students with the necessary practical and intellectual skills for them to think and write as historians at an undergraduate level; 2) to encourage them to think reflectively and critically about the nature of the historical discipline, its epistemological claims, and why we, as historians, do what we do in the way we do it. This will be achieved through four blocks of seminars and lectures. These will cover: The practice of history, introducing history at university level at both a practical and conceptual level. Historical methodology. This will cover the development of university history in the nineteenth century and how this differed from the study and writing of history that had gone before. It will also consider the impact of the Social Sciences on the historical profession during the twentieth century. The varieties of history. This will examine some of the major themes and approaches, such as Marxism or nationalism, in modern historical scholarship. Beyond history. The final block will consider the linguistic turn and new ways of studying and writing history in the twenty-first century.A fifth component, concentrated in the first three or four weeks of the module, will provide training in core, practical skills (library and bibliographic skills, IT skills and the use of MyFolio and PDP). 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      SE301 - Social Anthropology

      
      
       Social Anthropology is a discipline which arose with other social sciences in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, social and cultural anthropology has made a speciality of studying 'other' peoples worlds and ways of life.  With increasing frequency, however, anthropologists have turned towards 'home', using insights gained from studying other cultures to illuminate aspects of their own society.  By studying people's lives both at 'home' and 'abroad', social and cultural anthropology attempt to both explain what may at first appear bizarre and alien about other peoples' ways of living whilst also questioning what goes without saying about our own society and beliefs.  Or, to put it another way, social and cultural anthropology attempt, among other things, to challenge our ideas about what we take to be natural about 'human nature' and more generally force us to take a fresh look at what we take for granted.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HI434 - Introduction to the History of Science

      
      
       Science has arguably been the greatest force for cultural change in the last 500 years.  Scientists have changed the way we see the world, the way we see ourselves, and have equipped us with technologies that enable us to fly in the sky and shoot neutrinos under the ground.  They have taught us that our observations can shift the nature of physics, yet that we are nothing more than jumped-up apes.  This module visits some of the most important events and developments since the so-called scientific revolution (c. 1700) in order to give a representative view of the history of science.  It also introduces key themes that have been pursued by historians science that collectively call into question some key assumptions about what science is really like.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI438 - Vikings: the European Project, 750-1066

      
      
       Vikings, in the popular imagination, are commonly perceived as horn-helmeted, blood-thirsty pirates who killed and pillaged their way across Europe in the Middle Ages with their blood-stained axes. In reality, Vikings did much more than that. They changed the existing early-medieval political order for good; they contributed a great deal to the international trade, economy and urbanisation of different parts of Europe; and they explored and settled the uncharted territories of the North Atlantic, specifically the Scottish Isles, Iceland, Greenland, and as far as 'Vinland' (parts of Newfoundland), becoming the first Europeans to reach and temporarily settle in the North American continent; and they were perhaps the most engaging story-tellers of their time. By the time the Norse settled down and ceased raiding in the second half of the eleventh century, they had fundamentally altered the political, religious, economic and military history of much of the known world. This course will attempt to separate fact from fiction by critically reading and analysing primary source documents alongside archaeological, linguistic and place-name evidence, and thereby uncover the real history that lies behind the well-known stories of the Viking World. In addition, the students will be introduced to the major historiographical debates related to the Viking Age.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI411 - Later Medieval Europe

      
      
       This module is a survey of medieval Europe from c. 1000 to c. 1450. It includes elements of political, institutional, religious, social and cultural history. The module is intended to provide students with a foundation that will allow them to make the most of other courses in European history, particularly those focusing on the Middle Ages and Early Modern period, by equipping them with a grounding in geography and chronology, as well as in a variety of approaches to the study of history. Lectures will provide an overview of some of the periods defining features including the feudal system; kingship; the crusades, warfare and chivalry; popes (and anti-popes); monasticism and the coming of the friars; heresy; visual culture; women and the family; and towns and trade. Two-hour fortnightly seminars will introduce students to the reading and understanding of primary sources on relevant topics.

      HI397 - Cinema and Society, 1930 - 1960

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with an introduction to the ways in which historians use film as evidence.  It draws on a wide range of films, and stresses that they are to be understood in the context of the societies that produced them.  The films themselves reflect the ways in which the national cinemas of Britain, Europe and America portrayed the world around them.  The module will question the extent to which cinema, the most potent method of mass communication during this period, influenced hearts and minds by looking at films that were commercially successful and popular.  In this way, students will be introduced to the use of non-literary sources as historical documents, will be taught how to interpret them and become aware of the importance of contextualising evidence within a wider framework.Topics to be covered:Britain and the Great War: The Battle of the Somme; Soviet cinema: Battleship Potemkin; America in Depression: Grapes of Wrath; Britain at War: In Which We Serve; America at War: Bataan; Germany at War: Titanic; The McCarthy Era: On the Waterfront

      HI430 - Modern British History (Part Two)

      
      
       The course will provide a survey of the major events, themes and historiographical debates in modern British history from the early twentieth century to the 1990s. It will examine the roles of total war, imperialism and decolonisation, social welfare legislation, the advent of mass culture in shaping the nation. Subjects to be covered will include: crisis and reform in Edwardian Britain; politics and society in the Great War; stagnation and recovery in the interwar years; appeasement; the Peoples War, 1939-45; the welfare state; decolonisation; the affluent society and the politics of consensus; the end of consensus 1970-79; nationalism and devolution; Thatcher and the rolling back of the state; New Labour.

      HI431 - The Renaissance in the British Isles, 1400-1600

      
      
       English history is traditionally divided along dynastic lines and the divide between the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period is usually dated to 1485. As Sellar and Yeatman observed The reign of Henry VII marks the end of the Middle Ages. Yet scholars of English literature, drama and culture have long been used to looking past political events and dynastic change to chart longer-term developments. This module introduces students to the years 1400-1600 as a cohesive period in English history that saw a transformation in political, literary, intellectual and religious culture. Moreover, in European terms the years from 1400 to 1600 witnessed the rise to cultural hegemony of the studia humanitatis, the discovery of the New World, and the religious upheavals of the European Reformation. This module looks at the major political events of these years  the Lancastrian Revolution, the Wars of the Roses, the Henrician Reformation, the Mid-Tudor Crisis, and the problems of female monarchy during the reign of Elizabeth I  in the context of longer term developments in the cultural, intellectual and social history of England. Students will be introduced to literary texts including both poetry and drama, material culture, and the built environment, alongside more traditional historical sources (such as chronicles, administrative records and correspondence) as sources for the historian of pre-modern England.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI432 - 1450 - 1600: The Age of Reformation

      
      
       This module will provide a survey of the major events, themes and historiographical debates in early modern history from the Renaissance to religious wars of the early seventeenth century. This period in European history witnessed the cultural and social upheaval of the Reformation, the advent of print and the intellectual changes associated with Humanism, the formation of recognisably modern nation states, and the beginnings of Europes troubled engagement with the wider world. . As with the complementary module on later European history (c.1600-1750) the lectures and seminars will be arranged around six key areas:  1) religion 2) intellectual and scholarly life 3) economy 4) society 5) politics and war and 6) culture. These themes will be approached through the examination of national histories, specific events, and historiographical controversies. The topics covered will reflect the research and teaching interests of the School of Historys four permanent early modernists and prepare students for early modern modules taken at I and H level. Students will be encouraged to take this module along with a similar module in the Spring term which will cover the period from c.1600 to c.1750.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI353 - Britain and the Second World War: The Home Front

      
      
       War has often been seen as a catalyst for change. This module will examine how far this was true of politics, society, culture and the economy in Britain in the Second World War. The module will draw on a wide range of primary sources: Parliamentary debates, contemporary writings, including those of George Orwell and J B Priestley, cartoons, diaries, and personal memoirs. In order to increase familiarity with primary sources students will complete a compulsory document question as part of their Coursework. By the end of the module students should be able to discuss with authority the varying interpretations of the impact of the war. They will also have experienced the different approaches of political, social, cultural and economic historians, and this should provide a basis for choice of modules in Stage 2.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HI366 - Britain in the Age of Industrialisation 1700-1830

      
      
       This module aims to provide students with an historical analysis of the classic phase of British industrialisation, traditionally known as the Industrial Revolution.  Historians nowadays emphasise the gradual nature of industrial transformation in Britain, and the period considered here is sufficiently long to encompass several key issues in economic history: the transformation of the rural sector, the role of international trade in development, the origins and dynamics of industrial growth and innovation, the rise of a consumer society, the process of urbanisation, and the social costs of industrialisation.  The module will provide a grounding in historical concepts appropriate to the social sciences, and students will acquire a familiarity with historical statistics.

      SE588 - Advanced Social Anthropology 1: Power and Economy

      
      
       The module is a cross-cultural analysis of economic and political institutions, and the ways in which they transform over time. Throughout the term, we draw upon a range of ethnographic research and social theory, to investigate the political and conceptual questions raised by the study of power and economy. The module engages with the development and key debates of political and economic anthropology, and explores how people experience, and acquire power over social and economic resources. Students are asked to develop perspectives on the course material that are theoretically informed and empirically grounded, and to apply them to the political and economic questions of everyday life. The module covers the following topics: the relationship between power and authority; key concepts and theoretical debates in economic anthropology; sharing and egalitarianism; gift exchange; sexual inequality; violence; the nation state; money; social class; work; commodification; financialisation.

      SE589 - Advanced Social Anthropology II: Religion &  Cosmological Imagination

      
      
       This module is focused on a diverse range of approaches deployed by anthropologists to the study of religion, and belief and symbolic systems. It introduces a range of an-thropological insights to the ongoing transformations of religious traditions and belief systems vis-&agrave;-vis colonial encounters, post-colonial settings, as well as globalisation. The aim of the module is to familiarize students with the complex interactions between lived religious practice, religious traditions, and the ways in which these are intertwined with other domains of social life, politics, economics and ideology. The key topics covered in this module focus on ritual and sacrifice; witchcraft and sorcery; secularisation and fundamentalism; millennialism and conversion; cosmology and ideology; human and non-human relationships; modes of religiosity, rationality and belief; mediation and ethics. This module will develop students awareness of the strengths and limitations of anthropological insights compared to other disciplinary perspectives on religion such as theology, cognitive science or sociology.

      SE586 - Ethnographies 1

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of reading four professional ethnographic monographs in their entirety.  The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the thematic topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology I module, i.e. Kinship and Social Organisation, and Economic Systems.  Students will be expected to come to seminars with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology I.  Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier class meetings, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      SE587 - Ethnographies 2

      
      
       The curriculum for this module will consist of professional ethnographic monographs of varying length to be read at the rate of one (or selected substantial parts of one) monograph per week. The selection of the ethnographies will be determined by thematic conjunction with the analytical topics to be taught in the Advanced Social Anthropology 2 module, thereby divided into two congruent blocs. These are labelled Power and Authority and Belief and Practice [see Module specification for SE 589]. Students will be expected to come to class with notes from their reading and will be encouraged to discuss that reading and to relate it to wider anthropological issues raised or implied by the authors of the ethnographies and also dealt with historically and analytically in the co-requisite module Advanced Social Anthropology 1. Considerable time will be spent, particularly in the earlier classes, on instruction about how to read an ethnography e.g. on how to examine its implicit (as opposed to explicit) theoretical assumptions, on how to place it within the historical development of the discipline, on how to evaluate its empirical exemplification of particular theoretical problems, on how to evaluate the relationship between description and analysis, on how to evaluate it contribution to particular issues and topics within anthropology, and on the examination of its structure, presentation and ability to communicate an understanding of a social group through the written word.

      HI5075 - Marvels, Monsters and Freaks 1780-1920

      
      
       Society has always been fascinated by those deemed different and over time, unusual people have been viewed and constructed in a myriad of ways.  The course explores the continuities and changes surrounding those classed as different. Broadly, the course will investigate the changing nature of difference from the 1780s to the 1920s. It will examine the body and mind as contested sites; spaces occupied by those considered different; the establishment of normality versus deviance; the changing conceptions of difference over time; relationships between unusual people and the wider society. Using a broad range of sources, from novels to film, the course will trace the shifting cultural constructions of difference.

      HI566 - History Dissertation

      
      
       The purpose of the Stage Two History Dissertation is to provide students with the opportunity to explore a topic of their choice in depth, and at a more critical level than is usually possible within the constraints of a normal coursework essay. The essay must not be more than 10,000 words in length, excluding the bibliography. Students choose a topic in consultation with a member of the History School, who will provide supervision and advice on sources. A definitive title must be submitted to the supervisor by the end of the Autumn Term (Term 1) of the student's second year. The Dissertation will be written in the Spring Term (Term 2) and must be submitted by 12 noon on the first Monday of the Summer Term (Term 3). Unlike the dissertation in the Special Subject, the Stage Two History Dissertation may be based on the extended reading of secondary sources, although students will be encouraged to use primary sources wherever possible. Topics should not relate directly to the Special Subject which the student intends to take in their third year.

      HI5013 - Popular Religion and Heresy, 1100-1300

      
      
       This module examines the rise and spread of popular religious movements in Western Europe from the eleventh to the early fourteenth century and considers how some of these movements became seen as heresy and were associated with political dissent, ideas of persecution and social and economic change. It also considers the leadership of the Medieval papacy and its contribution to the transformation and condemnation of religious and heretical movements. The module finally explores the reasons why popular religious movements provoked such strong reactions and compares and contrasts the treatment of these religious and heretical movements with that given to other social minorities (especially women, lepers and homosexuality).The course will draw on narrative, hagiographical, documentary and visual sources. The course will require students to engage with primary sources, and to think critically about theoretical approaches toward the above mentioned themes.

      HI5021 - Science, Power and Politics in Twentieth Century Britain

      
      
       This module covers the period approximately 1900-79 and follows the fortunes of H. G. Wells open conspiracy  his scheme by which scientists would rule the world.  The aim is to understand what scientists (and their friends and critics) thought was the social role of science during this period, and how they sought to make sure that science played that role.  We aim to find out why scientists thought a scientific approach to life and society was desirable; how they sought to impose it; and to what extent, or in what ways, they were successful in their aims.  Along the way we will see how scientists engaged with particular political ideologies, and with the government.  Examples covered include the poverty vs. ignorance nutrition debate during the great depression, the development of nuclear power and consumer technology at the Festival of Britain.  We will see the pivotal role played by WWII in terms of facilitating scientists ambitions to govern, and the rise of psychology as arguably the most influential science in terms of governance.  The module makes particular use of fictional and documentary film sources as a means to understand the place of science in public culture.

      HI5092 - Armies at War 1914-1918

      
      
       This module will offer a comparative study of the armies of the Great Powers during the First World War. The module will adopt the war and society approach to this topic and so will focus on the social composition and combat effectiveness of the armies concerned, along with civil-military relations and the higher strategic direction of the war. This module will therefore seek to answer some of the key questions of the Great War: how did the Great Powers manage to raise and sustain such large armies, why did soldiers continue to fight, given the appalling casualty rates; how politicised were the armies of the Great War, why were politicians allowed to embark on foolhardy military adventures, how crucial were the Americans in securing Entente victory and how effectively were economies adapted to meet the demands of the armies? Comparative topics for discussion in seminars will include; planning for war, recruitment and conscription, the officer corps, generals and politicians, discipline and morale; and attitudes to technological advances.

      HI5096 - Modern German History, 1918-1990

      
      
       Focusing on the history of modern Germany in the Twentieth Century, the module examines major changes and continuities in the development of a highly advanced, industrialised but also militarised European nation state which played a central role in shaping the modern European geographical and political landscape. The module explores the end of the Imperial Monarchy after the end of the First World War in 1918, the role of the Allied reparation demands, hyper-inflation and political instability of the Weimar Republic, and the rise of National Socialism and the Third Reich during the 1930s. The course will chart the influence of anti-Semitism, racial eugenics and geopolitics in Germanys quest for world domination during the Second World War and assess the legacy of the Holocaust in defining post-war German identity and society. By examining the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the module will take a critical look at the politics, ideology and day-to-day history (Alltagsgeschichte) of East and West German society during the Cold War, and explore the underlying factors which led to the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and subsequent German reunification.

       Between 1815 and 1914 Britain engaged in only one European war. The Empire was, therefore, the most consistent and most continuous influence in shaping the army as an institution and moulding public opinion of the army. This module will examine various aspects of the British armys imperial experience between 1750 and 1920 (although the focus will fall, for the most part on the small wars of the Victorian period). The central focus will be on the campaigning in Africa and India, exploring how a relatively small number of British soldiers managed to gain and retain control of such vast territories and populations. Through an examination of a wide range of literary and visual primary sources, the module will also explore how the imperial soldier specifically and imperial campaigning generally were presented to and reconfigured by a domestic audience.Topics covered will include:The everyday life of the imperial soldierRepresenting the imperial hero: Henry Havelock and Charles GordonThe portrayal of imperial campaigning in contemporary popular cultureThe legacy of the Boer War: commemoration, doctrine and reformThe modern memory of colonial warfare: from Lives of a Bengal Lancer to Zulu

      HI5023 - The American Civil War Era 1848-1877

      
      
       This course will examine this key era of US history by examining the key political and social events, developments in the history of ideas and historiographical controversies from the victory over Mexico to the final withdrawal of US troops from the South. It will focus on the changes that occurred and the changing interpretations of them. Students will be able to see the interplay of forces and ideas that led to a conflict that few, if any, wanted and lasted for longer than anyone expected. Historical and fictional depictions in art and film will be evaluated for the ways they shape perspectives. The key historical topics include the rise of slavery as a public issue in the late 1840s, the attempts to find compromise within the Constitutional framework, the activities of the extremists, the changing nature and goals of the war, the effects the war had on both sides, the plans for the post-war period, the changing elite and popular attitudes, the nature of the final, pragmatic arrangements that the country accepted. Students will be able to pursue topics of their choice alongside and as part of these themes.

       Cultures never develop and grow in isolation. They are built on the values of past generations, and they are shaped and challenged in interaction with other cultures. The main objective of this module is to explore and present the powerful interaction between Europe and the Islamic world in early modern times, c. 1450-1750.The course will firstly provide an overview of the rise and fall of three major Islamic states and empires (the Abbasid Caliphate, the Safavid Empire, the Ottoman Empire). It will then assess the early modern European encounter with the Islamic world 1) by discussing the scholarly, religious, political and economic incentives for this encounter; 2) by documenting the exchange of knowledge, ideas, values and material objects this encounter stimulated in the early modern period; 3) by exploring the enormous impact, which this encounter had on European civilization. The course will focus on the following topics and areas of life:1) Transmission of scientific, technical and medical knowledge. 2) Collecting manuscripts and studying the languages of the Islamic world 3) Trade and economic exchange4) Conflict and cooperation5) Understanding Islam, translating the Koran6) European discovery of Arabic literature, art and architecture7) Arabs in the West (diplomats, travellers, scholars and prisoners)8) Europeans in the East  (diplomats, travellers, scholars and prisoners)

       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

       This module is meant to introduce students to the key processes and dynamics of sub-Saharan African history during the past two centuries. The course covers three chronological periods: the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. In their study of the pre-colonial period students, will especially familiarize themselves with the changing nature of African slavery and the nineteenth-century reconstruction of political authority in the face of economic, environmental and military challenges. The colonial period forms the second section of the course. Here, students will gain an understanding of the modalities of the colonial conquest, the creation and operation of colonial economies and the socio-cultural engineering brought about by European rule. The study of the colonial period will end with an analysis of African nationalisms and decolonisation. In the final part of the course, students will develop an understanding of the challenges faced by independent African nations. The nature of the post-colonial African state will be explored alongside such topical issues as the Rwandan Genocide and the African AIDS epidemic.

       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation.  The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis.  Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars.  Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape.  A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion.  Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates.  Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

      HI6036 - Science Satirised

      
      
       By looking at how science and its practitioners have been represented in or made use of satire, we gain an important perspective on how science and society have interacted as the former came to dominance as an authoritative source of knowledge. Friends and enemies of science have used satire to gain sympathy or call its claims into question. Where science has provoked hope, fear, admiration or suspicion, where it has been deeply involved in political or military endeavour, where it has overstated its claims or fed visions of a better future, satire has cast popular and elite opinions into sharp relief. From Thomas Shadwells The Virtuoso and Gullivers Travels, Georgian and Victorian caricature, science fiction and Cold War film, to The Simpsons and the Infinite Monkey Cage, science and the men and women who have produced it have proved to be fertile sources for comedy and biting wit.

How it reacted to the crushing defeats of 1940 in France and 1942 in the Far East before transforming itself into a war-winning force. The course will begin with the inter-war army examining its lack of doctrine and the confused role it had in British and imperial defence plans. From there it will move on to examine the transformation of the army from a pre-war small professional outfit to a vast conscript army, before concluding on the situation in 1945, the retention of peacetime conscription and adaptation to the Cold War world. It will take a broad approach to military history, studying the political, economic and cultural realities behind the force.

       We seem, as it were, to have conquered andpeopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind.Sir John Seeley, The Expansion of England (1883)Despite Seeleys assertion of accidental conquest, at its zenith the British empire decidedly controlled over &frac14; of the worlds global real estate, and 1/5 of the worlds population. The economic, cultural and global impact of British colonialism is still very much apparent today - from contested borders and inter-state disputes, through languages and cultures, to the inequities in wealth and trade that exist between the prosperous North and the underdeveloped South. Why, then, was imperial expansion so vehemently defended by its protagonists in the 19th and 20th Centuries? And what made colonial conquest, colonisation, and economic exploitation of non-European spaces feasible on such a global scale and for so long? These are the big questions that underlie this module. Using documentary sources and specialist texts and articles, we shall investigate various aspects of British colonial rule from the perspective of its practitioners and from that of their colonial subjects. The intention is to try and understand European imperialism on its own terms, to interrogate the cultural and conceptual discourses that underpinned its existence, and to reflect upon the many ways in which the history of European empire has shaped the modern world in which we live today.

       Seventeenth-century Britain experienced considerable division and tension, most obviously in the Civil Wars in mid-century between the countries which comprised the multiple kingdom of Britain.  The aim is to examine the reasons for, and the attempted resolution of, major political and religious problems, with a clear sense of the European context in which these events were played out.  Topics to be studied will include the ideological clashes between crown and parliament in England; the political and cultural divisions of `court' and `country'; religious disunity across the three kingdoms; the expansion of a `public sphere' of politics and religion; the failure of republican government in the 1650s; the instability of Restoration politics and the coming of the Glorious Revolution; and Britain's changing role in Europe across the century.

       This module explores the place of death within late medieval English culture, focusing especially on the visual evidence of tombs, architecture, and illuminated manuscripts. It will begin by examining how ideas about death and the dead were expressed in works of art before the arrival of the Black Death to England in 1348. We will then explore the ways in which funerary sculpture, architecture and painting changed after, and perhaps because of, the devastation of the plague. These sources will be set within the context of literary, documentary and liturgical evidence. Further, it will explore how historians approach the history of death from different disciplinary perspectives, and consider the place of visual evidence within a range of sources and methods.

       Condemned by the international community for refusing to sign the Kyoto Accords, rendered powerless by electricity blackouts, and stricken by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the United States of America is today embroiled in a narrative of environmental controversy and catastrophe.  This module explores to what extent the USA has been inviting doomsday throughout the modern (twentieth-century) period.  Commencing with an introductory session on writing and researching American environmental history, the module is then split into four sections: Science and Recreation, Doomsday Scenarios, Environmental Protest, and Consuming Nature.  Over the twelve weeks we will consider a range of environmental issues that include wildlife management in national parks, pesticide spraying on prairie farms, nuclear testing in Nevada, and Mickey Mouse rides in Disneyland.  By the end of the module, we will have constructed a comprehensive map of the United States based around themes of ecological transformation, assimilation and decay.

       Fundamental to Western European political and cultural ambitions since the mid-eighteenth century has been technological change.  This module provides a unique and stimulating social history of science and technology in a period of industrialisation and imperial expansion.  In the first part, we examine the twin foundations of British industrial and imperial power exemplified by the dramatic eighteenth-century voyages of Captain James Cook around the Pacific, and by the evolution of the steam engine by James Watt in the same period.  In the second part of the module we focus on the powerful new nineteenth century technological systems - railways, steamships, electric telegraphs and ship canals - which served to discipline the diverse cultures of Empire, whether British, American or Continental.  In these ways, the module will provide a striking foundational study for an enriched understanding of politics and society in the modern world.

      SE592 - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies

      
      
       The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

       European Societies surveys the social anthropology of contemporary Europe, with a focus on Western European urban and rural societies. The module explores changes in European societies since the end of the Cold War, including conflict related to the reorganisation and fortification of Europes southern and eastern borders. We read ethnographies exemplifying contemporary approaches to studying industrial and post-industrial societies. We critically review key debates in the study of community and identity politics; nationalism and ethnic conflict; borders, migration and transnationalism; tradition, modernity, and heritage; tourism; industrial and post-industrial work; new religious movements; and biosocialities. A further focus is interrogation of the concept of Europe itself, through analyzing the process of Europeanization within the EU, and issues raised by the financial crisis; and through presenting ethnographic vantage points from which students can rethink the idea of Europe for themselves. The module includes a critical history of anthropological study of Europe and the Northern Mediterranean, with special attention to the role of the University of Kent in the development of the regional literature. It is designed to be accessible to anthropology students, and those interested in European studies more generally.

       Over the course of twelve weeks this module provides students with a working knowledge of the ethnography of the countries of Southeast Asia and gives them the opportunity to discuss contemporary issues affecting the region.  After being introduced to the places and peoples of the  countries of Southeast Asia, students are directed to a study of agricultural and industrial developments, the political systems which exist at local and national levels, the importance of religious belief in everyday life, and issues of gender and power in the region.Students should note that although this is an area course it is also an anthropological one and consequently students are urged to bring into their discussions in seminars and essays comparative material from other regions of the world to provide a dimension of cross-cultural analysis.The emphasis of the module will be largely on Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand though the other countries of the region will receive frequent mention. Students are encouraged to introduce into discussions and essays reference to ethnographic examples from countries in the region in which they have an interest but which may not have received much attention in the lectures.

      SE579 - The Anthropology of Amazonia

      
      
       Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized -- an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

        This module will study the political, religious and social history of England, and also English relations with Wales, Ireland and Scotland in the context of the unification of Britain. The theme of the integration of the realm will be traced from the Yorkist foundation of the councils in the North of England, and in the Marches of Wales, to the creation of Great Britain in the reform debates, the control of the periphery by the centre and the unification of the British Isles under James VI and I. Within this framework subjects such as the royal courts of Renaissance England, the rather different impact of the Reformation in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, the Tudor commonwealth, plantations in Ireland and North America will be examined in the context of the emergence of the sovereignty of the King in Parliament.

      HI6060 - After Stalin: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union

      
      
       This module addresses the politics, ideology and culture of the USSR in the post-war era. It starts with an exploration of late Stalinism, before covering Khrushchev's reforms, Brezhnevs neo-Stalinism and Gorbachev's perestroika. Along with these themes, time will be devoted to: the intelligentsia; labour camps and the release of detainees in the 1950s; Soviet science; religion and spirituality; emerging nationalism; the Human Rights Movement; village prose; the Soviet economy; foreign policy and policy in the near abroad; the collapse of the USSR; and Yeltsins reformism and the new Russian state. The approach is interdisciplinary, and this will be reflected in the wide range of primary sources used; and throughout the module students will be introduced to the relevant historiography.

      HI6061 - Human Experiments & Human Rights during the  Cold War

      
      
       This Special Subject examines the history of human rights in human experimentation during the Cold War, and traces the development of biological and chemical warfare research from the Second World War through to Allied military research in the 1950s and 1960s. It charts continuity and change in the development of medical ethics standards in modern military research on humans, and assesses the extent to which research subjects were informed of the risks involved in the research. The module explores Allied war-time research and the international response to news of Nazi medical atrocities. The Nuremberg Medical Trial and the Nuremberg Code are important milestones in the history of informed consent and modern medical ethics. The module looks at the nuclear testing programme that was conducted by the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1950s, and investigates in detail the evolving chemical warfare programme at Porton Down in the United Kingdom where one of the servicemen, Ronald Maddison, died from exposure to the nerve agent sarin in 1953. The history of research into incapacitants and biological warfare agents is located into a wider context of an evolving system of medical ethics in which non-therapeutic experiments without consent were increasingly seen as unethical and unlawful. Finally, the attempts by veteran groups for recognition and compensation will be examined as part of a wider political history of the Cold War which has shaped our understanding and memory of the more recent past.

      HI6055 - Literature & History:Text & Context in C.19thScience

      
      
       This module puts together the methods of literature and history.  Its case studies come from nineteenth-century science, as it is in this area of scholarship in which some of the most exciting and stimulating historicist scholarship has arisen of late.  The first term will be spent on a review of various approaches to literature and history, from textual to contextual, taking in, for example, the narrative turn, reception theory and reader-centred studies.  This will be partnered with a slow and in-depth reading of two nineteenth-century texts that have spawned most historicist scholarship in literature and science: most likely George Eliots Middlemarch and Charles Darwins Origin of Species (tbc).  In the second term, students will choose a selection of novels (one per week) for study within the framework of methodologies covered in term 1.  Students will be guided and advised in their choices, which are anticipated to lie in the realm of nineteenth or possibly twentieth-century science.  Students will develop two of their chosen texts for independent research, assessed by means of substantial essays.

      HI6044 - British Politics 1625-1642

      
      
       When Charles I became king of England in March 1625, he also inherited the thrones of Scotland and Ireland. This module will consider politics, religion and culture in Caroline Britain from Charles Is assumption of the triple crown, until he declared war on the English Parliament in August 1642. During this fascinating period, the king pursued controversial policies and eventually faced armed resistance in all three kingdoms  the struggle against the Scottish covenanters (1639-40); the Irish rebellion (1641); and finally, civil war in England (1642). Students will have the opportunity to analyse a wide variety of primary source material, including royal letters, private correspondence, paintings, journals, newsletters, religious documents and state papers. Through these rich sources, students will explore the many factors which shaped the character of Charless government and will be encouraged to draw their own conclusions about the nature and success of the kings approach. Was this a period of relative harmony until the late 1630s or were all three kingdoms on a trajectory towards conflict from the outset of the reign? By the end of the module, students will be able to answer these, and other historiographical questions, including perhaps the most crucial question of all - what were the causes of the British Civil Wars?

      HI6049 - The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the Atlantic World, c. 1500 - 1900

      
      
       This source-based class confronts two of the most sophisticated and contentious historiographical debates of the last century: the so-called Origins Debate about the role of race in the entrenchment of slavery in America in the 17th and 18th centuries and the debates about the place of capitalism in explanations for the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. The course will also confront the role played by political and constitutional change in the development and dismantling of the slave system. Students will consider the character and place of slavery within European and American economic, political, and cultural development. The course will examine the conditions under which slave societies emerged; the part played by empire, and the distinctive combination of ideological and theological strands that produced a compelling challenge to slavery for the first time. It challenges participants to examine the utility, in this context, of such historiographical motifs as: race, slavery (as distinct from the slave trade), liberty, empire, capitalism, mercantilism, humanitarianism, as well as the separation between economics and politics in the development and abolition of slavery. As such, it exposes participants to the history of race, cultural history, intellectual history, political, imperial, and economic history, all within the context of the Atlantic experience. With constant attention to the problem of accommodating slavery within comparatively liberal cultures and societies, this course navigates students through much of modern American, European history, and African history.

       The study of war has, until recently, tended to focus upon leaders, combatants and military strategies. This course, however, will analyse the experience of civilians on the Home Front, using World War Two Britain as a case study. Sessions will typically include:Sources for Studying the Home Front 1) propaganda posters, film and radio; 2) Mass Observation; and personal testimonies; the Blitz spirit; The Enemy Within: Enemy Aliens and Jews; Minority groups on the home front: Travellers and Immigrants; Womens war service; Cultural representations of women; Soldier heroes and civilian men; Cultural representations of men; Evacuating the home front; Brief Encounters; Politics I: social policies; Politics II: a swing to the left?; and the impact of war on the home front: change and continuity. There will also normally be a trip to the Imperial War Museum.

      HI6039 - The Rights Revolution: The 20th Century US   Supreme Court & Society

      
      
       This course will look at the central theme of the "Rights Era"- the move in the U. S. from a customary deference to tradition and view of the mainstream to the enforcement of political equality with far less regard for mainstream views. It will examine competing views of what "equality" means and consider the numerous groups that have demanded it since 1945 and the way they both fought for their causes and created the turbulence and confrontation in American society after 1960. These groups include, but are not limited to, African Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women, the disabled, certain religious groups, those who have faced discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, as well as other groups that followed similar legal strategies, such as environmentalists and those who seek greater guarantees of property rights, free speech rights, and gun rights. This not only is an essential topic for understanding the modern United States but as UK is currently undergoing similar legal changes, it has meaning for contemporary Britain.  This course assumes no prior knowledge of American law or of the courts in the United States. It can also include subjects of interest to students not listed above, assuming sufficient materials are available on those topics. It aims to places this groups & their activities in the context of the time and show how the strategies worked (or failed) and the reaction of both elite and general opinion to the claims.

      HI6040 - The Discovery of the World c.1450 - 1800

      
      
       A century after the discovery of the Americas, in a treatise published in 1580, the radical Reformer Jacob Paleologus argued that it was most unlikely that the ancestors of the American natives could have crossed the Ocean and he concluded hence that all humans cannot descend from one single individual, Adam. So the discovery of America not only challenged traditional geographical knowledge, but also questioned fundamental religious, anthropological and historical assumptions. This module will explore early modern encounters with new worlds and with non-European cultures and it will ask about the impressions, which these encounters made and the manifold changes of European life they brought about. Based on the weekly reading of one primary source, we will follow travellers, merchants, scholars and missionaries on their expeditions to the inner parts of Africa, to the court of the Shah of Persia, to China and to the Americas. We will watch them drawing maps of uncharted lands and compose dictionaries of unheard languages. And we will not only listen to European voices, but will also try to reconstruct the experiences and impressions of non-European actors and visitors. The central aim of this module is to discuss the religious, intellectual, political and economical contexts of these discoveries and cultural encounters. We will ask how the various actors organized and methodized their expeditions and how they interpreted their discoveries. The module will also address the consequences, which these discoveries entailed. How did they affect the traditional European ideas about mankind, religion, the world and their position in it? How did they influence European life style, fashion, art and literature? How did they affect the lives, social structures and cultures of the discovered people?

      HI6035 - Anglo-French Relations 1904 - 1945

      
      
       The diplomatic relationship between Britain and France in the first half of the twentieth century can be seen as a marriage of convenience.  Not natural historical allies, the British and French governments were forced increasingly to work together to combat the tensions in Europe that led to the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars.  This module explores the love-hate relationship between the two countries in tracing the origins of the Entente Cordiale, and by addressing some of the major historiographical debates in twentieth century international history. Lectures will provide students with an overview of these debates and the topics listed below, and seminars will encourage students to consider their understanding of these areas and critically engage with them through discussion.Themes explored will typically include, imperialism, political reform and its impact on foreign policy formation, democratisation, the rise of nationalism, peacemaking at the end of the two world wars; the Ruhr Crisis, the Treaty of Locarno, the League of Nations; the Kellogg Briand Pact; the Briand Plan; the Geneva disarmament conferences of the late 1920s/early 1930s; Eastern Europe and Russia; different strategies to deal with the rise of Hitler; the fall of France, the rise of Vichy; the secret war; the outbreak of the Cold War.

      HI6029 - The Great War: British Memory, History and   Culture

      
      
       The aim of this course will be to show how far the Great War has infiltrated into modern culture and to test the validity of Paul Fussell's thesis that the Great War created Britain's modern cultural atmosphere. Fussell contends that modern society is marked by a love of irony, paradox and contradiction formed by the experience of the Western Front. Against this theory we will set the ideas of Samuel Hynes and Martin Stephen, as argued in their works, A War Imagined and The Price of Pity. This course will explore how the Great War has influenced our lives and why we have certain images of it. Why, for example, do most people associate the Great War with words such as 'waste', 'futility' and 'disillusion'? Why does the morality of the Great War seem so tarnished, while the Second World War is conceived as a just war? The course will be based upon literature (high and popular), poetry, art, architecture and film. We will therefore be 'reading' a 'primary text' each week. The course will serve to highlight many of themes of the 19th and 20th century British survey courses and will further contextualise the course on Britain and the Home Front in the Second World War.

       'At the height of the imperial age church people liked to argue that religion and the British empire were inseparable - that the visible, commercial and political empire was woven into the fabric of another, invisible country - a spiritual empire.' Hilary M Carey, Empires of Religion, p. 1.This module will critically interrogate Careys above assertion by asking how far can missionaries be considered agents of imperialism? In so doing it will interact with issues of how we define imperialism, how useful the idea of cultural imperialism can be to the modern historian, and how we might talk meaningfully about 'the colonising project'. Students will be introduced to the history of the British Empire and more broadly the history of British cultural engagement and encounters with indigenous peoples within and outside of the empire. You will analyse and discuss the socio-economic, cultural and religious impact of Christian mission in the 'age of expansion', and will tease out issues of cultural encounters, indigenous agency and resistance, race, racism and cultural chauvinism. We will explore the impact of mission literature and experience on the British public's own imaginative engagement with non-western peoples, and will use an exciting and diverse range of textual, visual and oral sources. Students will emerge with a complex understanding of colonialism, in all its variegated forms, and how it has shaped (and continues to shape) the modern world in which we live today.

       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation. The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis. Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars. Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape. A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion. Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates. Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

      HI6024 - Napoleon and Europe, 1799 - 1815

      
      
       A decade ago John Dunne, in a review article, described Napoleonic history as a poor relation of the French Revolution that seemed on the verge of making good. These prophetic words described well the growing interest among scholars in Bonapartes ambitious Imperial mission extending beyond Frances natural frontiers. The work of historians Stuart Woolf and Michael Broers has postulated that the Napoleonic mission to 'integrate Europe under a single system of governance' could be viewed as a form of 'cultural imperialism in a European setting.' This special subject will introduce students to the pros and cons of this historiographical debate. It will give final year students an alternative means of engaging with the familiar historical category of Empire. There is no shortage of source material translated into English relating to this period. Indeed the memorial de Saint Helene has been available to the Anglophone world since 1824. Consequently a critical and in-depth engagement with primary material will be one of the priorities of this special subject. The focus on French expansion abroad, in the early nineteenth century, challenges one to move away from understanding the Napoleonic Empire in national terms; this course in essence, by its very nature, is European in both scope and content. To do this it will explore processes of acculturation and international competition on a thematic basis. It will examine, in broad multi-national manner, the complex interaction between centre and periphery or what Italians, more prosaically, describe as conflict between stato reale and stato civile. Napoleon was his own best advocate when it came to forging his posthumous legacy. Students will be encouraged to appraise critically his memoirs and understand that behind claims of progress lay a brutal struggle for the fiscal military resources of Europe. Yet, even more important will be to consider that while the military and political effects of the grand Empire were ephemeral, it created a judicial and administrative edifice which survived well beyond 1815 and continues to shape European civilisation to this day. Of course, laws do not merely structure the powers of governmental action but have a complex impact on notions of citizenship, the economy and culture (especially family life). This special subject will investigate the Napoleonic Empire in its many facets. Students will be urged actively to pursue their individual interests in either war and society, Empire, political culture and/or gender.

       This module is meant to introduce students to the key processes and dynamics of sub-Saharan African history during the past two centuries. The course covers three chronological periods: the pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. In their study of the pre-colonial period students, will especially familiarize themselves with the changing nature of African slavery and the nineteenth-century reconstruction of political authority in the face of economic, environmental and military challenges. The colonial period forms the second section of the course. Here, students will gain an understanding of the modalities of the colonial conquest, the creation and operation of colonial economies and the socio-cultural engineering brought about by European rule. The study of the colonial period will end with an analysis of African nationalisms and decolonisation. In the final part of the course, students will develop an understanding of the challenges faced by independent African nations. The nature of the post-colonial African state will be explored alongside such topical issues as the Rwandan Genocide and the African AIDS epidemic.

       The French Revolution continues rightly to be regarded as one the great turning points of modern European History. This course will introduce students to the political, social and economic context of France from the accession of Louis XVI to the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. It will explore and assess the divergent interpretations for the origins of the revolutionary conflagration of 1789. There will also be an attempt to understand how a revolution based on the triad liberty, equally and fraternity, lost of sight of its humanitarian aspirations and quickly descended into fratricidal political terror and warfare on a trans-European scale. Students will also be encouraged to cast a critical eye on the vexed question of the French Revolutions contribution to modern political culture.There may be a visit to Paris and Versailles in Week 18.

      HI6014 - Riders on the Storm

      
      
       The module will study the economic, environmental, social and political crisis of the fourteenth century, which had a long-term impact on the population of the British Isles and beyond. The fourteenth century was a troublesome period in European history. After some two centuries of economic growth, demographic expansion and relative social stability, Europe entered the era of harsh socio-economic crises, bio-ecological shocks, climatic deterioration and political turmoil. The ubiquitous Four Riders of the Apocalypse, as seen by the contemporaries, brought much hardship upon all strata of European society. The Black Death of 1348-51, whose nature is still debatable, killed about 40 per cent of British population and altered the land-to-labour ratio, leading to far-reaching social and economic changes within the society. Violent and costly wars of England against Scotland and France commanded increased taxation, caused supply shock, high transaction costs and hence high prices and low real wages. Between 1314 and 1322, there was a series of failed harvests, brought about by continuous torrential rain and exceptionally cold winters. This agrarian crisis, or the Great Famine, caused starvation and malnourishment, chiefly among the lower echelons of the society. The famine spread chaos and anarchy over the country, with crime rates going up. To these should be added another significant biological crisis: mass cattle mortality of panzootic proportions, which ravaged the whole of Northern Europe and decimated its bovine stocks. This period can be regarded as truly a watershed one in British, and European history, and there is no doubt that it has changed the existing economic and social order forever.This module will look at each and every of these crises and at the interaction between them. A particular attention will be given to reading primary sources, shedding much light on our understanding of these crises. In addition, each class will involve a reading and discussion of one scholarly work (an article, or a book chapter) related to the subject.1. An introduction to the Fourteenth-Century Crisis: themes, sources and problems2. In the wake of the storm: thirteenth-century prosperity and growth3. The problem of overpopulation in Europe c.1300: Malthusian Crisis?4. The famine of 1315-21: the worst subsistence crisis in the West ever recorded?5.

      HI5024 - The American Civil War Era 1848-1877

      
      
       This course will examine this key era of US history by examining the key political and social events, developments in the history of ideas and historiographical controversies from the victory over Mexico to the final withdrawal of US troops from the South. It will focus on the changes that occurred and the changing interpretations of them. Students will be able to see the interplay of forces and ideas that led to a conflict that few, if any, wanted and lasted for longer than anyone expected. Historical and fictional depictions in art and film will be evaluated for the ways they shape perspectives. The key historical topics include the rise of slavery as a public issue in the late 1840s, the attempts to find compromise within the Constitutional framework, the activities of the extremists, the changing nature and goals of the war, the effects the war had on both sides, the plans for the post-war period, the changing elite and popular attitudes, the nature of the final, pragmatic arrangements that the country accepted. Students will be able to pursue topics of their choice alongside and as part of these themes.

      HI5022 - Science, Power and Politics in Twentieth Century Britain

      
      
       This module covers the period approximately 1900-79 and follows the fortunes of H. G. Wells open conspiracy  his scheme by which scientists would rule the world.  The aim is to understand what scientists (and their friends and critics) thought was the social role of science during this period, and how they sought to make sure that science played that role.  We aim to find out why scientists thought a scientific approach to life and society was desirable; how they sought to impose it; and to what extent, or in what ways, they were successful in their aims.  Along the way we will see how scientists engaged with particular political ideologies, and with the government.  Examples covered include the poverty vs. ignorance nutrition debate during the great depression, the development of nuclear power and consumer technology at the Festival of Britain.  We will see the pivotal role played by WWII in terms of facilitating scientists ambitions to govern, and the rise of psychology as arguably the most influential science in terms of governance.  The module makes particular use of fictional and documentary film sources as a means to understand the place of science in public culture.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
