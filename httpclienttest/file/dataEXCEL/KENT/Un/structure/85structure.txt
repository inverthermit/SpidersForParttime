 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CL329 - Introduction to Archaeology

      
      
       The module will introduce archaeology as an academic discipline, providing grounding in basic concepts and methodology and techniques of analysis relating to archaeological evidence. It will provide background relevant to other archaeological and historical modules through examining aspects of the archaeological process in prehistoric, Roman and medieval contexts. It will enable students to make an informed choice of subsequent modules. Topics will include basic fieldwork methods and techniques, and an introduction to key topics in interpretation, such as society and culture, ritual and religion, technology, etc. through case studies e.g . of Pompeii, Sutton Hoo, and the Ice Man.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL353 - The Civilisations of Greece and Rome

      
      
       In the Autumn term we start with Greece. The history will centre on Athens in the 5th century B.C. We begin with Solons reforms, then after considering the period of the Persian invasions we study the developed democracy with its empire under Pericles and its destruction in the Peloponnesian War. After 5 weeks, we move to the literature of the period, more specifically, the development of tragedy and comedy in fifth-century Athens, examining staging and dramatic conventions such as the role of actor, chorus and religious function and plot, especially the handling of mythological themes. We will analyse a selection of major plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Within this framework the module explores the role of tragedy and comedy as vehicles for public debate in the democracy, and its treatment of justice, religion, rationalism and patriotic themes.In the Spring term, we move to Rome. In the Roman part of the course we shall treat the last century of the republic. Our focus will be on how that republic fell and was replaced by the empire whose founder was Augustus. Among the themes examined will be political violence, the intrusion of the army into political life and the rise of the warlord. In the literature part of the Spring term the module is concerned with the patronage of the arts (poetry, history writing, art and architecture) under Augustus, with the role of the arts as propaganda, and the thesis that writers were recruited to act as spokesmen for the policies and ideals of the principate. The central theme is the creation of enduring images of Rome and Empire, using traditional historical and mythological materials; alongside this the module treats areas of public policy such as moral legislation, festivals, religious reform and the position of women.  The module is also concerned with the responses of the writers, whether as supporters of public policy, or as commenting on and reacting against it. Thus, its content is much better understood as a result of the historical development outlined in the first part of term.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP311 - The Tale

      
      
       This literary-critical module deals with a wide range of selected international tales ranging from antiquity to the present day. The module addresses issues such as the development of oral folktales and fairytales into written forms, and discusses various short prose genres including Aesopian fables, myths, folktales and fairytales, as well as tales of the fantastic, 19th century art-tales and the modern short story. The framework of discussion comprises a general survey of the issues that face the comparatist. In the course of the module students practice different methods of literary analysis, including close reading and comparative analysis by examining story-motifs and story-structures, and by considering symbolic meanings in the light of psychoanalytic concepts. Students also explore questions of transmission and transformation (e.g. how stories and motifs travel from one culture to another and alter in shape and emphasis) and questions of genre (for example the fantastic). A selection of critical texts on narrative devices and patterns, on psychoanalytical, structuralist and feminist approaches to the fairytale and on genre theories are studied in conjunction with the primary texts.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

      CP510 - The Text: Approaches to Comparative Literature

      
      
       The module covers a variety of exercises from the close reading of poetic texts to the appraisal of a range of theoretical writings. Most material is drawn from European writing of the past two centuries, though the Bible and some medieval and Renaissance texts are also studied. Topics include: the holy text; the literary text; genre; poetic form; the fantastic; the avant-garde; postmodernism; text and image; psychoanalytic readings; and deconstruction.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP524 - Fiction and Power

      
      
       This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran.  Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish).This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP534 - Modern Arabic Literature and the Middle East

      
      
       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP646 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP652 - Postcolonial Images of Africa and South Asia

      
      
       This is a module about the intersection of colonial power relations, anti-colonialism, postcolonialism, feminism, and identity politics in literature from 1940 to 2010 which interrogates the influence of imperialism on a sense of self. It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

      CP658 - Nordic Literature and Film

      
      
       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CL713 - Athenian Power Plays

      
      
       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      CL310 - Greek for Beginners

      
      
       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL652 - Gods, Heroes and Mystery Cults: Religion in  Ancient Greece

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL659 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world? This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

      CL663 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences. Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject. Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness. In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject. An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus. The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine. From here, the study will move into the Roman period. Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry. For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen. Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another. Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.

      CL665 - Constantinople and the Late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL666 - Foundations of Britain

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity.  A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

      CL692 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

       This module provides an introduction to some of the major works in ancient Greek philosophy in relation to ethics, aesthetics, political theory, ontology and metaphysics. Students will study substantial portions of primary texts by the Pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle. The emphasis throughout will be on the philosophical significance of the ideas studied. The module will concentrate on understanding key philosophical arguments and concepts within the context of the ancient Greek intellectual tradition. This means that students will gain a critical distance from normative and modern definitions of philosophical terms in order to understand how Greek philosophy generally approached questions and problems with different suppositions and conceptions of reality, reason and the purpose of human existence.

      CP658 - Nordic Literature and Film

      
      
       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

      CP652 - Postcolonial Images of Africa and South Asia

      
      
       This is a module about the intersection of colonial power relations, anti-colonialism, postcolonialism, feminism, and identity politics in literature from 1940 to 2010 which interrogates the influence of imperialism on a sense of self. It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP653 - Comparative Literature and English & Linguistics in the Classroom

      
      
       This module will provide the opportunity for third year undergraduates to gain valuable transferable skills by giving them some first-hand teaching experience in a secondary school classroom. Each student will spend half a day each week for one term in a local school under the supervision of a specific teacher, who will act as a mentor, and decide the tasks and responsibilities of the student. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other.They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progressed, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school.

      CP647 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP650 - Decadence in Fin-de-Siecle Europe

      
      
       The module explores the development of decadence in late nineteenth-century Europe as an artistic response, a philosophic expression and a social critique. Taking the work of Charles Baudelaire and the failed revolutions of 1848 as its starting-points, the module examines decadence as both a symptom of political and artistic frustration and as a psychological investigation of what Max Weber would later term the disenchantment of the world. Key themes will include the role of the artist, nature versus artifice, fantasy and desire, sexuality, social morality versus personal freedom, and death. The module will not only explore decadence in terms of different literary genres (fiction, drama, poetry) but also in the visual arts of the period.

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

      CP611 - Postmodernism

      
      
       The module will begin by studying some of the major early postmodern writers such as Charles Olson and Alain Robbe-Grillet. This will be followed by a comparative analysis of second-generation postmodern literature in both Europe and the United States, including writers such as Italo Calvino and Thomas Pynchon. The module will also reference postmodern texts in other media such as film (the Free Cinema movement) and the visual arts (most notably, Pop Art). Almost from its inception, postmodernism has been subject to theorization and to a highly charged debate over its status as either a radical and liberating movement or as a mere symptom of late capitalism and a media-saturated culture in which the medium is the message. Students will study some of the key theoretical documents on the postmodern, including extracts from the work of Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard.

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.

       The module covers a variety of exercises from the close reading of poetic texts to the appraisal of a range of theoretical writings. Most material is drawn from European writing of the past two centuries, though the Bible and some medieval and Renaissance texts are also studied. Topics include: the holy text; the literary text; genre; poetic form; the fantastic; the avant-garde; postmodernism; text and image; psychoanalytic readings; and deconstruction.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP518 - The Book and the Film: Adaptation and Interpretation

      
      
       This module seeks to explore how novels and plays are adapted and interpreted for the screen. We shall be looking at how certain texts lend themselves to multiple reshaping such as Laclos 'Dangerous Liasions' and Henry James 'The Turn of the Screw', both of which have been adapted for the screen more than once. We shall also analyse lesser known works that have gone on to become feature films, such as Arthur Schnitzlers short work Dream Story, filmed as 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Adaptations directed by widely recognised filmmakers such as De Sica,  Max Ophuls, Kubrick and Pier Paolo Pasolini will also be examined with a view to eliciting and understanding their particular approach to, and filmic vision of, written texts.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

      CP641 - SWIPE Undergraduate Conference

      
      
       The SWIPE (Student Work-in-Progress Exposition) undergraduate conference module is designed particularly for undergraduate students working on their final-year dissertations or other extended coursework, but is open to all third year students. The conference will provide students with an opportunity to conduct independent research. In addition, it will give them a chance to discuss their and their fellow students work and to test some of their ideas in a larger context. The conference aims to foster the ongoing academic dialogue within Comparative Literature, the disciplines joined in LLB and the School of European Culture and Languages as a whole as well as with the larger scholarly community of the University of Kent at Canterbury and its other campuses. By giving students an opportunity of being introduced to, and partaking in, one of the prevalent forms of professional academic dialogue, the SWIPE conference is designed as a preparation for students further participation in exciting academic debates and to invite them to consider the challenges and opportunities of postgraduate studies. At the same time, it will serve to hone transferable skills useful in students professional careers in other sectors of public life (organisation, presentation, communication and the demonstration of self-confidence). To ensure a certain thematic coherence and provide students with some orientation while still leaving them a wide-ranging spectrum of thematic concerns from which to choose their subjects, a specific, but not limiting, conference title will be chosen every year (to be advertised in the current stage 2 and 3 handbooks). Titles like Violence, Love, Death, Silence or Resistance are envisaged. Students participation will not be limited to the six workshops and the presentation of their paper but will also include the complete organisation of the conference; with respect to the latter, the module convenors role is restricted to giving guidance, advice and, whenever necessary, help. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory.

      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

      CP502 - Fiction and Power

      
      
        This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran. Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish).

      CL709 - Greek Philosophy: Plato and Aristotle

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to some of the major works in ancient Greek philosophy in relation to ethics, aesthetics, political theory, ontology and metaphysics. Students will study substantial portions of primary texts by the Pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle. The emphasis throughout will be on the philosophical significance of the ideas studied. The module will concentrate on understanding key philosophical arguments and concepts within the context of the ancient Greek intellectual tradition. This means that students will gain a critical distance from normative and modern definitions of philosophical terms in order to understand how Greek philosophy generally approached questions and problems with different suppositions and conceptions of reality, reason and the purpose of human existence.

       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity. A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL607 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences.  Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject.  Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness.  In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject.  An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus.  The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine.  From here, the study will move into the Roman period.  Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry.  For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen.  Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another.  Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       The module is based on individual scholarship and research supplemented by group guidance seminars and one-to-one supervisions.The project will be chosen by the student with the advice of the tutor. In terms of  the primary data it could involve investigation of antiquarian literature; archive documentation including cartographic sources; Sites and Monuments Records; museum collections; observation of monuments in the field; or participation in approved field work or excavation. Engagement with some types of primary data may be recorded in the form of a log which can appropriately be included as a component of the final report on the project. Choice of project will be informed by personal interests, the fulfilment of the aims of the module, the availability of expert supervision, and the accessibility of data.

      CL639 - Constantinople and the late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

      CL590 - The Foundations of Britain: Archaeology of the first Millenium B.C.

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world?  This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

       This module is intended to introduce undergraduate students to research. As such it provides an opportunity to work on a topic of their own choosing, in either archaeology, history or ancient literature. Originality and feasibility are important aspects of writing dissertations, and to avoid problems topics will be scrutinised and approved by CLAS before research can begin. Students can expect guidance from the module convenor and an academic supervisor throughout the process, varying from one-to-one tutorials to classes on how to edit your own prose. There will also be a meeting regarding the Dissertation at the end of the Spring term of the previous year to clarify arrangements and to outline what work is required on this module.The programme document with regulations is sent to all students at the end of spring term of Stage 2. Students are invited to suggest titles for comment, for which tutors are allocated. They are advised to do preliminary reading over the summer based on generic advice of the module convenor. They then choose precise topics in consultation with the convenor and personal tutors at the start of the autumn term. This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
