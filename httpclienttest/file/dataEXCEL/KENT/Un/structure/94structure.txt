 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EN333 - Romanticism

      
      
       This year-long course examines some of the most significant writing of the Romantic period (1780-1830) - a period in which the role and forms of literature were being redefined - alongside recent debates in critical theory. You will study a wide range of literary texts from the poetry of Blake, Wordsworth and Keats to the novels of Jane Austen and Mary Shelley, with reference to contemporary literary and political debates and against the backdrop of the periods turbulent history. In parallel, this module explores fundamental critical questions about literature: Why read it? What is an author? What is the role of poetry in society? How is literature shaped by culture? What is Art? Continuities and disjunctions between Romantic writers answers to these questions and those provided by more recent literary theorists will be a central concern of the course.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP311 - The Tale

      
      
       This literary-critical module deals with a wide range of selected international tales ranging from antiquity to the present day. The module addresses issues such as the development of oral folktales and fairytales into written forms, and discusses various short prose genres including Aesopian fables, myths, folktales and fairytales, as well as tales of the fantastic, 19th century art-tales and the modern short story. The framework of discussion comprises a general survey of the issues that face the comparatist. In the course of the module students practice different methods of literary analysis, including close reading and comparative analysis by examining story-motifs and story-structures, and by considering symbolic meanings in the light of psychoanalytic concepts. Students also explore questions of transmission and transformation (e.g. how stories and motifs travel from one culture to another and alter in shape and emphasis) and questions of genre (for example the fantastic). A selection of critical texts on narrative devices and patterns, on psychoanalytical, structuralist and feminist approaches to the fairytale and on genre theories are studied in conjunction with the primary texts.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      EN302 - Early Drama

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of medieval and early modern dramatic genres, from ninth-century Latin church drama to the commercial theatres of Shakespeare's London. Students will learn about methods for analysing past performances and existing texts, as well as how drama interacted with and responded to pivotal moments in British history, and the culture, politics and religion of the period.  As such, the module will function as an introduction to medieval and early modern studies more broadly and a platform from which to undertake early English literature and drama modules, such as Chaucer and Late Medieval Literature, Early Modern Literature, 1500-1700 and Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama, at Stages 2 and 3.  Students will read and discuss playtexts in modern translations, both as literary objects and live performance events. Regular optional site visits and screenings will contribute to students understanding of the dramas contexts, how plays might work in performance and to what extent they still speak to twenty-first century audiences. Lectures and seminars are designed to be varied and interactive, with the opportunity for everyone to participate and to develop key academic skills. The module is assessed by seminar contributions, creative and research-based coursework and a final end-of-year project, which will allow students the freedom to explore a topic of their choice creatively.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN331 - Readings in the Twentieth Century

      
      
       This module emphasizes the links between literature, history, and culture. It introduces students to the formative events, debates and struggles of the twentieth century, and how these have been addressed by different modes of creative and critical writing. Topics such as the First World War, Modernism, the Holocaust, the US culture industry, postcolonial studies, as well as 9/11, will be considered and discussed in relation to fictional and critical literature, films, photography, graphic novels, music, and other media. Weekly screenings will run alongside lectures and seminar discussions. Literary works across all genres will be read in relation to visual material  such as paintings, photography, various feature and documentary films, etc  and a range of selected critical reading. The majority of writing samples are drawn from English, American and more broadly anglophone writing, though several instances of writing in other languages will also be included (all taught in translation).

      EN332 - Writing America

      
      
       This module aims to emphasize connections between literature and culture in the USA, from early considerations of a distinct American literature to the present day. By way of six key themes or preoccupations, the module will introduce students to some of the major debates and antagonisms, and rhetorical and stylistic modes, that have formed and modified American literary and intellectual culture Questions of Belief, Gender, Race, Economy, Space, and Time will be approached through a range of textual forms set against their historical contexts and within the broader nexus of cultural production including the visual performing arts where appropriate. Students will be encouraged to examine the specific local, regional, and national frameworks within which these texts are produced, but also to look at the ways in which they resist and transcend national boundaries, in the development of an American register in world literatures for instance. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

Possible modules may include: 


                    
      EN695 - Empire, New Nations and Migration

      
      
       This course will introduce students to the field of postcolonial literature, focusing on the period from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The course will be divided into three consecutive areas: empire and colonisation; the processes of decolonisation; and migration and diaspora. Centred primarily on canonical British colonial texts, the first part of the course will explore issues surrounding language, cosmopolitan encounters, Orientalism, modernism and the genres of imperial fantasy. The texts in the second part of the module will be drawn from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. The intention is to allow students to bring these disparate regions and texts into a productive dialogue by reflecting on their common engagement with colonial and liberation discourses, as well as the legacies of partition. The course further aims to sketch a narrative of empire and decolonisation that links these issues to the context of narrating migration in our contemporary postcolonial world, a subject taken up more directly in the final part of the course.Some brief extracts from critical material on colonial discourse and history, decolonisation, postcoloniality and migration will be considered alongside the primary text each week. Together with a broad primary textual arc that stretches from the British empire to the contemporary metropolis, the course will give students a coherent intellectual narrative with which to explore changing conceptions of culture, history and postcolonial identity across the modern world.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN697 - Chaucer and Late Medieval English Literature

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of writing from the late medieval period.  It will focus on a number of central genres in English literature that emerge between the late fourteenth and early sixteenth centuries (from romance, tragedy and fabliaux through to morality plays and devotional prose) and will explore some key topics and themes in medieval literature, such as authority, gender, sexuality, piety, chivalric identity, narrative and voice, truth and destiny.  Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales will offer an accessible introduction to these core genres and themes, and initiate students in issues that are pertinent to less familiar writers and texts from the period, such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Malorys Le Morte Darthur, and The Book of Margery Kempe.  During the course of the module you will also learn about the historical and cultural contexts of the fourteenth, fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and how such contexts influenced the literature of the period.The themes and theories covered by the course will vary in response to the lecture programme and the emphasis and research specialisms of individual teachers.  Previous topics have included: gender and sexuality; authorship and patronage; history of the book; manuscripts and the printed texts; piety and devotion; iconography; social relations; performance cultures; audience, reading and reception; the body, corporeality and experience.

      EN681 - Novelty, Enlightenment and Emancipation: 18th Century Literature

      
      
       Before 1660 there was no English novel, and by the end of the eighteenth century there was Jane Austen. This module asks how such a literary revolution was possible. It investigates the rise of professional authorship in an increasingly open marketplace for books. With commercial expansion came experiment and novelty. Genres unheard of in the Renaissance emerged for the first time: they include the periodical essay, autobiography, the oriental tale, amatory fiction, slave narratives and, most remarkably, the modern novel. Ancient modes such as satire, pastoral and romance underwent surprising transformations. Many eighteenth-century men and women felt that they lived in an age of reason and emancipation  although others warned of enlightenments darker aspect. Seminar reading reflects the fact that an increasing number of women, members of the labouring classes, and African slaves wrote for publication; that readers themselves became more socially varied; and that Britain was growing to understand itself as an imperial nation within a shifting global context. It asks students to reflect, as eighteenth-century writers did, upon the literary, cultural and political implications of these developments

      EN692 - Early Modern Literature 1500-1700

      
      
       This module offers a survey of early modern literature from 1500 to 1700. Looking at a wide range of literature including poetry, prose and drama, students will consider the relationship between literary debate and form on the one hand, and political change, social identity and religious transformation on the other. We will consider how important debates surrounding political, social, gender and religious identity inflect and are reflected in the literature of the period, including works by Baldwin, Donne, Lanyer, Marvell, Milton and Behn. Students will also explore the boundaries of the literary canon, encountering pamphlets, sermons and conduct books, and consider the ways in which literary and non-literary texts both mirror and influence culture and society.

      EN694 - Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama

      
      
       The drama of early modern England broke new literary and dramatic ground. This module will focus on key plays across the period, exploring the development of dramatic writing, playing companies home within the London theatres, dramas links to court entertainment and its relationship to the provinces. Dramatic and literary form will be a central preoccupation alongside issues of characterisation, culture, politics and gender. Shakespeares work will be put into context in relation to the plays of contemporary dramatists as well as the various cultural, historical and material circumstances that influenced the composition, performance and publication of drama in early modern England.

      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory.

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

      CP510 - The Text: Approaches to Comparative Literature

      
      
       The module covers a variety of exercises from the close reading of poetic texts to the appraisal of a range of theoretical writings. Most material is drawn from European writing of the past two centuries, though the Bible and some medieval and Renaissance texts are also studied. Topics include: the holy text; the literary text; genre; poetic form; the fantastic; the avant-garde; postmodernism; text and image; psychoanalytic readings; and deconstruction.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP524 - Fiction and Power

      
      
       This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran.  Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish).This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP534 - Modern Arabic Literature and the Middle East

      
      
       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP646 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP652 - Postcolonial Images of Africa and South Asia

      
      
       This is a module about the intersection of colonial power relations, anti-colonialism, postcolonialism, feminism, and identity politics in literature from 1940 to 2010 which interrogates the influence of imperialism on a sense of self. It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

      CP658 - Nordic Literature and Film

      
      
       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

       This module examines literary works ranging from folk tales and sagas through the respective periods of national Romanticism to the present day written in the principal Nordic languages (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish), and will also explore some films from the region. The texts will be studied in English translations, and the films will be in the original language with English subtitles. Some of the themes to be extracted from these texts and explored in more detail include: Romanticism, exile, nationalism and post-nationalism, world literatures, translation and adaptation. The current new wave of Nordic crime fiction and its adaptations as TV dramas and films will also be examined, exploring reasons for the genres popularity (both within and beyond the region). The module will investigate how Nordic literature and film have developed diachronically, how the literatures of the various Nordic countries interact and interrelate, and how contemporary texts are rewriting and renegotiating the historical linguistic, geographic, ethnic and cultural borders of the region.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CP656 - Shakespeare's Afterlives

      
      
       How have twentieth-century writers across the world negotiated and appropriated Shakespeares omnipresent cultural influence? How have they revised, reinvented, and reimagined his legacy in Europe, Asia, and the Americas (North, Central, and South)? This module focuses on a selection of Shakespeares most influential plays (Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest) in order to examine how their thematic, historical, and cultural concerns have been transplanted to a wide range of global locations including the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, a farm in the USA, and the Argentine Pampas. The module also engages with theoretical notions related to the act of appropriating Shakespeare, including the theory of intertextuality, the Benjaminian concept of the afterlife of a text, and Genettes study of the palimpsest as a text derived from a pre-existent text. In addition, the module will reflect on issues of race, gender, and cultural identity embedded in the adaptations of the bard in the various world contexts in which his work has been complexly modernized and redeployed.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CP652 - Postcolonial Images of Africa and South Asia

      
      
       This is a module about the intersection of colonial power relations, anti-colonialism, postcolonialism, feminism, and identity politics in literature from 1940 to 2010 which interrogates the influence of imperialism on a sense of self. It considers the writing of a number of women and men from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India and Sri Lanka in a range of genres from the Francophone and Anglophone traditions (short story, essay, novel, autobiography). In light of the complex relationship between coloniser and colonised, we consider the political activism of many of these writers, as well as the ways in which their politics are articulated in their writing, whether fiction or non-fiction. We also examine to what extent this literature is representative of other postcolonial concerns such as nationhood and national consciousness, hybridity and assimilation, and exile and alienation within the larger context of cultural theory. Particularly significant is our interrogation of the violence inscribed in both the colonial system and the coloniseds fight for independence as seen from the psychoanalytical perspectives of Frantz Fanon in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Studying the primary and secondary texts in English, we bring awareness to the reading scene of the translation process as an important development in the transnational study of comparative literature in our global world. In so Doing, we acknowledge the significance of indigenous languages and dialects as signifers of subjecthood in conflict with the colonisers language. By exploring a variety of anti-colonial resistance and liberation discourses in relation to the development of current postcolonial thinking, the module also offers and insight into the history of the discipline of Colonial and Postcolonial studies. This module links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood (relationship between a sense of nationhood and writing), the I-level module CP510 The Text (as a corollary to the analysis of different reading perspectives), and the postgraduate level CP806 Postcolonial Cultures as part of the Taught MA Programme.

      CP653 - Comparative Literature and English & Linguistics in the Classroom

      
      
       This module will provide the opportunity for third year undergraduates to gain valuable transferable skills by giving them some first-hand teaching experience in a secondary school classroom. Each student will spend half a day each week for one term in a local school under the supervision of a specific teacher, who will act as a mentor, and decide the tasks and responsibilities of the student. The weekly school based work and university based work will complement each other.They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Initially, for these sessions the students will concentrate on specific aspects of the teachers tasks, and their approach to teaching a whole class. As they progressed, their role will be as teaching assistants, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may teach brief or whole sessions with the whole class or with a small group of students where they explain a topic related to the school syllabus. They may also talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly journal reflecting on their activities at their designated school. This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CP647 - Prize Winners

      
      
       The award of literary prizes is a highly potent tool of cultural policy that frequently determines the wider national and international impact of a literary work. As such it is of crucial relevance to the study of comparative literature in a number of ways: the award of literary prizes reflects the beginnings of the successful or, as the case may be, the (ultimately) abortive formation of literary canons; moreover, it affords insights into processes of cultural production and marketing and reveals in which ways political and economic agendas are tied up with these processes; it also offers a perspective on transnational and transcultural aspects of the production and reception of literature and indicates shifting notions of the social function of literature and the writer; literature is thus understood as a cultural product in ever changing contexts which is frequently subject to external forces of which literary prizes become indicators or even enforcers. This module will investigate with the methods of literary and cultural studies the development of a number of major literary awards which have achieved global significance, among them the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Man Booker Prize the Prix Goncourt (This list may be modified according to precedent to accommodate the topical relevance of individual award winners in the future.) Seminars will develop a historical perspective by scrutinising and analysing award winners of the past and their most recent counterparts in their different production and marketing contexts as well as in changing reception contexts: seminars will include the close reading of individual works as well as their critical reception, and the analysis of marketing strategies in various media (e.g. reports in culture magazines, reviews, displays in book shops, translations, etc.); final winners will be interpreted in the context of the respective long and short lists from which they emerged; historical developments will be taken into account, for instance by investigating forgotten prize winners in comparison with those who, largely through the agency of academic intervention, made it into the canon; the module thus also offers an insight into the history of the discipline of literary studies. (It links up logically with the C-level module CP321 Literature and Nationhood.)This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP650 - Decadence in Fin-de-Siecle Europe

      
      
       The module explores the development of decadence in late nineteenth-century Europe as an artistic response, a philosophic expression and a social critique. Taking the work of Charles Baudelaire and the failed revolutions of 1848 as its starting-points, the module examines decadence as both a symptom of political and artistic frustration and as a psychological investigation of what Max Weber would later term the disenchantment of the world. Key themes will include the role of the artist, nature versus artifice, fantasy and desire, sexuality, social morality versus personal freedom, and death. The module will not only explore decadence in terms of different literary genres (fiction, drama, poetry) but also in the visual arts of the period.

      CP644 - Creatures of the Night:  Vampires in Literature and Film

      
      
       This module introduces students to a range of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century literary and cinematic representations of vampires from different cultural backgrounds. It explores the reasons for the abiding allure of the figure of the vampire both in popular culture and in literary fiction. The module examines the ways in which vampires function as polyvalent symbols of specifically modern preoccupations, for the emergence and popularity of vampire tales is intricately bound up with the advent and wider cultural ramifications of modernity. What do vampires represent in each of the works discussed, and what hidden desires and anxieties do they allow authors and filmmakers to express? The vampire is an allegorically highly potent figure which is suspended between life and death and between animal and human existence. Vampires frequently serve as foils to discuss more contentious matters, in particular questions relating to sexuality, gender roles, class, immortality and the desire for everlasting youth, being an outsider, and addiction. Texts and films to be studied include John Polidoris The Vampyre (1819), Th&eacute;ophile Gautiers Clarimonde (1836), J. Sheridan Le Fanus Carmilla (1872), Bram Stokers Dracula (1897), F. W. Murnaus and Werner Herzogs Nosferatu adaptations (1922 and 1979), Angela Carters The Lady of the House of Love (1979), Neil Jordans Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Stephenie Meyers Twilight (2005)

      CP609 - Modernism and the European Avant-Garde

      
      
       The module will begin with the study of some of the major avant-garde movements (including Expressionism, Futurism, Imagism, Vorticism, Dada, and Surrealism) that sprang up in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Students will read a range of short manifestos and literary works by Tristan Tzara, Filippo Marinetti, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andr&eacute; Breton, and others. Once both the diversity and the international nature of modernism have been considered, students will go on to look in depth at a series of major modernist writers from different national backgrounds, and to identify what these writers share, what distinguishes them from one another, and, in some cases, what sets them in violent opposition. The aim here will be to give students a sense of the plurality of modernisms and the conflicts that were internal to the movement. Although the focus will be on some of the most significant individual works of modernist literature (for instance, Prousts Swanns Way, Kafkas The Trial, Joyces Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Eliots The Waste Land), shorter texts, both literary and critical/theoretical, will also constitute the recommended reading in preparation for seminars. Seminal essays by major commentators on the modernist movement such as Walter Benjamin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, and Theodor Adorno will constitute part of the primary reading. The aim throughout will be to strike a balance between close reading and the consideration of the more general theoretical and political issues at stake in the modernist revolution of the word. Students will also be encouraged to explore the ways in which modernism finds expression in the visual arts, particularly in Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstraction.

      CP611 - Postmodernism

      
      
       The module will begin by studying some of the major early postmodern writers such as Charles Olson and Alain Robbe-Grillet. This will be followed by a comparative analysis of second-generation postmodern literature in both Europe and the United States, including writers such as Italo Calvino and Thomas Pynchon. The module will also reference postmodern texts in other media such as film (the Free Cinema movement) and the visual arts (most notably, Pop Art). Almost from its inception, postmodernism has been subject to theorization and to a highly charged debate over its status as either a radical and liberating movement or as a mere symptom of late capitalism and a media-saturated culture in which the medium is the message. Students will study some of the key theoretical documents on the postmodern, including extracts from the work of Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lyotard.

      CP594 - Travel Literature

      
      
       Everybody travels, in one way or another. This module asks what it means to travel. In doing so, it addresses fundamental concerns, such as identity, foreignness, time, home, gender, power and ethics. By looking at texts from a wide range of periods and places, it will consider how these might be compared in their treatments of the shared theme of travel. It will also address the ways in which this theme affects and is affected by the genre of writing.

      CP534 - Modern Arabic Literature and the Middle East

      
      
       The module introduces students to one of the richest and most stimulating eras of Arabic literary innovation and aims to link literary processes of transformation to current political changes. Exploring how recent Arabic fiction prefigures the 2011 Arab Spring revolution, the module offers students the opportunity to study these works in English translation by analysing creative trends and movements that currently resonate around the region. In addition, the module explores how these emerging Arab voices negotiate links to the past in relation to texts such as The Thousand and One Nights. The module combines the methodological approaches of comparative literature, the sociology of literature and postcolonial theory and explores concepts such as cultural identity, gender, diaspora and historiography.

      CP510 - The Text: Approaches to Comparative Literature

      
      
       The module covers a variety of exercises from the close reading of poetic texts to the appraisal of a range of theoretical writings. Most material is drawn from European writing of the past two centuries, though the Bible and some medieval and Renaissance texts are also studied. Topics include: the holy text; the literary text; genre; poetic form; the fantastic; the avant-garde; postmodernism; text and image; psychoanalytic readings; and deconstruction.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CP518 - The Book and the Film: Adaptation and Interpretation

      
      
       This module seeks to explore how novels and plays are adapted and interpreted for the screen. We shall be looking at how certain texts lend themselves to multiple reshaping such as Laclos 'Dangerous Liasions' and Henry James 'The Turn of the Screw', both of which have been adapted for the screen more than once. We shall also analyse lesser known works that have gone on to become feature films, such as Arthur Schnitzlers short work Dream Story, filmed as 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Adaptations directed by widely recognised filmmakers such as De Sica,  Max Ophuls, Kubrick and Pier Paolo Pasolini will also be examined with a view to eliciting and understanding their particular approach to, and filmic vision of, written texts.

      CP636 - European Realism

      
      
       This module is concerned with the development of literary realism in nineteenth century Europe. A representative selection of writers is studied, including Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot, Tolstoy and Zola. We will explore realism not only as a set of techniques but also as an ideology: a particular way of viewing and re-presenting the world in literary form. As such, we will also explore contradictions in terms of the realist method, especially in its negotiation of gender, sexuality and desire. Although the focus is primarily textual, we will consider cultural and historical factors such as literary production, class and economic conditions, science and technology, religion and philosophy, and the social positions of men and women.

      CP641 - SWIPE Undergraduate Conference

      
      
       The SWIPE (Student Work-in-Progress Exposition) undergraduate conference module is designed particularly for undergraduate students working on their final-year dissertations or other extended coursework, but is open to all third year students. The conference will provide students with an opportunity to conduct independent research. In addition, it will give them a chance to discuss their and their fellow students work and to test some of their ideas in a larger context. The conference aims to foster the ongoing academic dialogue within Comparative Literature, the disciplines joined in LLB and the School of European Culture and Languages as a whole as well as with the larger scholarly community of the University of Kent at Canterbury and its other campuses. By giving students an opportunity of being introduced to, and partaking in, one of the prevalent forms of professional academic dialogue, the SWIPE conference is designed as a preparation for students further participation in exciting academic debates and to invite them to consider the challenges and opportunities of postgraduate studies. At the same time, it will serve to hone transferable skills useful in students professional careers in other sectors of public life (organisation, presentation, communication and the demonstration of self-confidence). To ensure a certain thematic coherence and provide students with some orientation while still leaving them a wide-ranging spectrum of thematic concerns from which to choose their subjects, a specific, but not limiting, conference title will be chosen every year (to be advertised in the current stage 2 and 3 handbooks). Titles like Violence, Love, Death, Silence or Resistance are envisaged. Students participation will not be limited to the six workshops and the presentation of their paper but will also include the complete organisation of the conference; with respect to the latter, the module convenors role is restricted to giving guidance, advice and, whenever necessary, help.

      CP629 - Second Thoughts: Women Novelists from Bronte to Jelinek

      
      
       This module investigates the representation of love, desire and the body in a selection of texts by women writers from different temporal, cultural and linguistic backgrounds. In particular we will look at the way representations of love, desire and the body reflect the respective socio-cultural contexts and the situation of women therein, how these writers deal with themes such as love, desire and eroticism, and what aesthetic strategies they use to tackle them. What models of feminine behaviour are celebrated or criticised? To what extent are relevant representational conventions adhered to or transgressed in these works? Charlotte Bront&euml;s Jane Eyre for example provides a complex representation of a split and conflicted female identity, torn between demands of the body, passions, rages and desires, and the demands of the mind, the spirit and the intellect. This conflict is externalised in the form of the characters Bertha Mason and Helen Burns, alter egos which Jane has to overcome and reconcile. Jane Eyre will offer a useful touchstone for other representations of female figures caught between social conventions and desires, and their attempts to come to terms with them. Students will be asked to engage with the siginificance of images and representations of women proliferated through literature. These representations provide or question role models, perpetuate or problematise stereotypical versions of feminine goals and aspirations.  Furthermore, emphasis will be placed on close readings of the various works, and students will be asked to pay close attention to cultural differences and variations, and to examine how the conceptions and representations of love and desire changed in the course of time. The selected fictions allow a comparative examination of a wide range of different perceptions by women writers of the body, of gender, identity, love, desire and sexuality and the way these reflect the respective wider ideological framework. Close readings of these texts are complemented by selected references to a body of feminist literary theory.

      CP627 - Science Fiction: History and Innovation

      
      
       This module examines the development of science fiction from the second half of the nineteenth century to its current global status in both serious and popular culture. It explores how science fiction has developed via the interaction of different genres, different media and different national cultures. The module begins with the work of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells since their fiction is at the root of international variants of science fiction. Special attention will be paid to the comparative analysis of science fiction from the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Consideration will also be given to the relationship of literature to film, especially surrounding topics such as aliens and alienation, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, dystopia and apocalypse.

      CP502 - Fiction and Power

      
      
        This module looks at a group of politically inspired novels and films, some of which were produced under the totalitarian regimes which held sway in Europe between 1917 and 1989, others deal with Latin American political unrest, the Middle East conflict and the Islamic revolution in Iran. Most explore ways of challenging and subverting authoritarian power structures and of articulating a critique in what Bertolt Brecht called 'dark times'. But we will also focus on less obvious negotiations of fiction with power, especially with respect to the various forms of power to which these texts are subject and in which they participate. The approach is comparative in two senses as the texts range historically and culturally as well as across genres and language barriers (Arab, Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish).

       This module will focus on a comparative study of twentieth-century poets writing in English from formerly colonised regions (Ireland, Caribbean, India).  Writers studied will include W B Yeats, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, A K Ramanujan and Lorna Goodison.  The aim of the course will be to evoke the complex relationship between local historical contexts, the effects of globalisation and the changing postcolonial aesthetics of their poetry.  Particular attention will be paid to the role of poetry in shaping, as well as questioning, national consciousness and in the articulation of concepts of individual, gendered and cultural autonomy.

       This module explores what fascinates travellers and writers about both familiar and far-flung places. London, Istanbul, Cairo; roads, railways, and rivers; oceans, deserts, and deepest England: each place or mode of travel will be investigated as a source of inspiration, fantasy, and desire. How do invention and authenticity jostle for precedence in fictional as well as factual travel? Does travel writing reveal more about the places visited or the subjectivities of the writers? We will focus on modern writers with glances back to historical precursors. Writers studied should include Jack Kerouac, Orhan Pamuk, Iain Sinclair, Che Guevara, Paul Bowles, Gautam Malkani, Edward Said, Patrick Wright.

Contexts will include modernity and the Holocaust, race and gender in modern America, and contemporary fictions of exile and encounter.  Among the writers considered will be Joseph Conrad, Toni Morrison, and J M Coetzee.  The course will also draw on a variety of twentieth-century cultural, social and psychological conceptions of belonging, from the work of Sigmund Freud through to the more recent ideas of Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and Zygmunt Bauman.
