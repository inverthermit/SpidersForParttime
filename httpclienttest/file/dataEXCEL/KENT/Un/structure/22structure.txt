      HI763 - How the West was Won (or lost): The American West in the Nineteenth Cen

      
      
       This module will explore the American West, looking at the social and economic dynamics underlying Western history, together with processes of environmental transformation.  The unit spans a chronological period from 1803  the Louisiana Purchase - to 1893  the date of the Chicago Exposition and Turners famed Frontier thesis.  Commencing with a look at constructions of the West in history, literature and film, the module will move on to critically analyse key issues and moments in Western History including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Gold Rush, and the Indian Wars.  Outline themes include the construction of regional identities, protracted conflicts for resources, environmental changes, and the continuing importance of the West as a symbolic landscape.  A key aim of the course lies in facilitating critical discussion on the process of nineteenth-century westward expansion, addressing issues of colonial conquest, environmental despoliation, economic change, and social cohesion.  Through lectures and seminars, we will explore the major themes of Western history in this period and examine relevant historiographical debates.  Portrayals of the West in art, literature, and film will be used extensively to illustrate the diversity of Western culture and situate the importance of myth in shaping popular and historical discourse.

      HI795 - Inviting Doomsday: US Environmental

      
      
       Condemned by the international community for refusing to sign the Kyoto Accords, rendered powerless by electricity blackouts, and stricken by the Hurricane Katrina disaster, the United States of America is today embroiled in a narrative of environmental controversy and catastrophe.  This module explores to what extent the USA has been inviting doomsday throughout the modern (twentieth-century) period.  Commencing with an introductory session on writing and researching American environmental history, the module is then split into four sections: Science and Recreation, Doomsday Scenarios, Environmental Protest, and Consuming Nature.  Over the twelve weeks we will consider a range of environmental issues that include wildlife management in national parks, pesticide spraying on prairie farms, nuclear testing in Nevada, and Mickey Mouse rides in Disneyland.  By the end of the module, we will have constructed a comprehensive map of the United States based around themes of ecological transformation, assimilation and decay.

      HI6039 - The Rights Revolution: The 20th Century US   Supreme Court & Society

      
      
       This course will look at the central theme of the "Rights Era"- the move in the U. S. from a customary deference to tradition and view of the mainstream to the enforcement of political equality with far less regard for mainstream views. It will examine competing views of what "equality" means and consider the numerous groups that have demanded it since 1945 and the way they both fought for their causes and created the turbulence and confrontation in American society after 1960. These groups include, but are not limited to, African Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women, the disabled, certain religious groups, those who have faced discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, as well as other groups that followed similar legal strategies, such as environmentalists and those who seek greater guarantees of property rights, free speech rights, and gun rights. This not only is an essential topic for understanding the modern United States but as UK is currently undergoing similar legal changes, it has meaning for contemporary Britain.  This course assumes no prior knowledge of American law or of the courts in the United States. It can also include subjects of interest to students not listed above, assuming sufficient materials are available on those topics. It aims to places this groups & their activities in the context of the time and show how the strategies worked (or failed) and the reaction of both elite and general opinion to the claims.

       Credits: 60 credits (30 ECTS credits).

      HI6049 - The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the Atlantic World, c. 1500 - 1900

      
      
       This source-based class confronts two of the most sophisticated and contentious historiographical debates of the last century: the so-called Origins Debate about the role of race in the entrenchment of slavery in America in the 17th and 18th centuries and the debates about the place of capitalism in explanations for the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. The course will also confront the role played by political and constitutional change in the development and dismantling of the slave system. Students will consider the character and place of slavery within European and American economic, political, and cultural development. The course will examine the conditions under which slave societies emerged; the part played by empire, and the distinctive combination of ideological and theological strands that produced a compelling challenge to slavery for the first time. It challenges participants to examine the utility, in this context, of such historiographical motifs as: race, slavery (as distinct from the slave trade), liberty, empire, capitalism, mercantilism, humanitarianism, as well as the separation between economics and politics in the development and abolition of slavery. As such, it exposes participants to the history of race, cultural history, intellectual history, political, imperial, and economic history, all within the context of the Atlantic experience. With constant attention to the problem of accommodating slavery within comparatively liberal cultures and societies, this course navigates students through much of modern American, European history, and African history.

       Credits: 60 credits (30 ECTS credits).
