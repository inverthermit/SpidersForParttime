      AR322 - Modern House

      
      
       The concept of building type is crucial in developing an understanding of the built environment as a coherent endeavour. Recurrent plan types are important in establishing order in architecture and interiors. Equally, divergence from the norm is important in rethinking established spatial types. The most ubiquitous building type is the house, and its analysis comprises the essence of this module. We shall be studying the house as an example of vernacular design, as a response to the particular environment of a region, as well as analysing key examples of the modern house. By this means, the key periods and events in the development of modernism may be charted. Students will gain an understanding of the modern house by reading relevant literature and architectural drawings and photographs, in addition to making scale models of particular houses, and writing illustrated essays.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      AR542 - Climate

      
      
       Students will explore passive means of environmental control to achieve comfort in different climates. Vernacular precedents of passive design will be examined and distinguished from the cultural influences on design in different cultures. The concept of exterior and interior climates will be critically investigated and students will develop a good understanding of the microclimate created by cities, landscapes, groups of building and individual structures. The influence of materials, form and construction on environmental performance will be examined with reference to precedents and benchmarks. Specific techniques and methodologies for climate analysis and environmental design will be learned and applied.The assignment concerns the development of environmental design strategies that are to be integrated appropriately into the design work of the concurrent module Architecture and Landscape. Students will demonstrate how they have provided for fresh air to move through the main building of Architecture and Landscape, as well as how they have exploited passive resources for cooling, temperature control, solar gain and the control of solar gain, both in the summer and winter and for the daytime and night-time. The integration of these into the main building of Architecture and Landscape will take heed of the functions of the spaces and their disposition and be arranged for good efficacy. Students will concisely describe the rationale of the environmental strategies and explain the operation of any technology used in realizing these strategies and illustrate this with appropriate plans and cross-sections.

      AR544 - Renaissance to Neoclassicism

      
      
       This module addresses the developments in architecture from the early fifteenth century to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The cultural context of the time will be studied by outlining the socio-economic conditions, the new attitudes to knowledge, arts, history and architecture. Architectural treatises of the early Renaissance and the related developments in the practices of painting and sculpture will be brought into the consideration in order to highlight specific innovation and dynamics of architecture. The underlying conditions of the movements known as Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Rococo and Neo-classicism will be addressed and relevant buildings, objects of art, architectural texts and dominant narratives will be studied. Landscape design will be discussed through the comparative analysis between the formal landscape design and the phenomenon of the picturesque. The architecture of symbolism and utopianism is also considered. The eighteenth-century organization of life and labour, the emerging spaces of production, as well as the establishment of the academies, museums, and other institutions will be addressed, in order to highlight the way in which these phenomena contributed to the rise of the architectural profession and the building guilds.

      AR597 - Dissertation

      
      
       This module offers students the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and understanding of a particular aspect of architecture. The topic to be studied is agreed with the Module Convenor and an appropriate supervisor is nominated from the teaching staff. Moreover the dissertation will provide students with the opportunity to develop more advanced academic research and writing skills. It forms part of the research strand within the architectural curriculum, which complements the design strand of the studio. Fortnightly supervisions lead to a draft handed in towards the end of autumn term, with the draft submission of ca 4000 words (for formative assessment) at the start of the Spring Term, and final submission (for summative assessment) of the 7,000-8,000 word dissertation during the Spring Term. Students may opt to focus their research question around making and assembling an artefact, as a piece of research-through-practice,  in which case the written element may be reduced by up to 50%, by agreement with the supervisor in combination with the submission of the artefact, which it will frame and discuss theoretically.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      AR543 - Urban

      
      
       This module, the final one of the programme, engages students in the design of a building in an urban centre. In lectures and seminars, it deals with distinctive urban plans in the contemporary world, as well as a consideration of their historical provenance. The design exercise seeks to locate a complex building type, of mixed social use, within a developed urban fabric. The module assesses a student's capabilities, skills, knowledge and understanding that are brought to bear on such a design. The key design skill to be demonstrated is the integration of the conflicting demands surrounding a proposal that successfully balances the requirements of client, user and the public with the cultural, technical and environmental pressures encountered. As the final statement of student competence, the design will be expected to successfully demonstrate critical and reflective awareness of process across a wide range of indicators, including awareness of fine art theories and methods of production as applied to building. The outputs required will comprise a fully designed building proposal, with an accompanying report. The report component will comprise design studies and a technical analysis of the building and its systems, responding to a targeted lecture series. They will also produce a building assessment from the perspective of a professional practice, management & law lecture series, and generate appraisals of the building as though it were a live project, in terms of appointment, procurement, planning permission, statutory permissions and cost.

       Credits: 45 credits (22.5 ECTS credits).
