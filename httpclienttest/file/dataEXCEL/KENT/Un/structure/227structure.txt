      DI303 - Survey and Monitoring for Biodiversity

      
      
       The broad aim of this module is to provide students with practical field experience in wildlife conservation monitoring and assessment methods. Specific aims are to introduce students to a range of basic field techniques and develop their skills in the collection, analysis and presentation of field data.  The module provides an essential practical element of the Biodiversity Conservation and Management programme.The module is offered as an intensive one-week residential field course during the Easter Vacation.  Groups of students will undertake five-day surveys and monitoring projects under the supervision of members of staff.  Each project will assess the biodiversity of an appropriate taxonomic group (such as invertebrates, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles and plants) in either a terrestrial or freshwater habitat.  Students will be expected to arrive at an appropriate design for data collection in discussion with their supervisor, carry out the survey, analyse the data and present a short seminar on their results at the end of the week.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI304 - Economic and Environmental Systems

      
      
       Economic growth and the environmental are intimately linked. With climate change threatening our current way of life and global biodiversity we need to understand the linkages between economic activity and the environment in order to avert catastrophic changes.  This module explains these links and possible solutions to climate change and other threats.  In Part 1, we consider the evolution of the earth and the environmental processes that determine past and present patterns of biodiversity. In Part II we look at how human-environment interactions and specifically consider the role of market forces in determining resource use and in the creation of environmental problems. In Part III we investigate contemporary environmental problems and explore possible solutions through various market and government mechanisms such as carbon trading, environmental taxation and new forms of consumerism.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI305 - Biodiversity

      
      
       This module will introduce a range of fundamental concepts that underpin our understanding of biodiversity and, therefore, the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The differences and similarities between the multiple definitions for the term biodiversity will be considered, in addition to examining how scientists are trying to assess the magnitude of biodiversity on the planet. Spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity will be investigated, along with the importance of biodiversity (both use and non-values). The module will then explore the contemporary threats to biodiversity and provision of associated ecosystem services, in conjunction with a broad overview of the methods conservationists employ to protect and maintain biodiversity.

      DI311 - The Green Planet

      
      
       The module will begin with the question of what defines a plant and how they are related to the other kingdoms. This will then lead on to a journey from the plant cell to vegetation communities and how they interact with, and are important to other groups of organisms. The module will then finish with a discussion surrounding the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (from the Convention on Biological Diversity) and the targets within this document.

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      DI505 - Conceptual Frameworks in Conservation Science

      
      
       The aim of the module is to cover major overarching and current issues, such as understanding biodiversity in the fossil record, extinction rates and how they are calculated, and how many species are there and why it matters. By looking at these bigger picture issues conceptual thinking will be brought in; for example how using basic biological knowledge, we can estimate the number of species on Earth. In addition, there will be guest lectures, and discussion of current global issues that are making the press such as the results of major international conferences; past examples included the outcomes of the Copenhagen conference on climate change and the concept of 'Planetary Boundaries'.

      DI508 - Skills for Conservation Biologists (Field trip)

      
      
       The most important skill of a field biologist is to be able to correctly interpret the biological meaning of their data. This course is designed to introduce and re-affirm statistical concepts, and their correct use and relevance to field biologists. Throughout this taught module, emphasis will be placed on practical application of statistics as much as possible, and when and how they are applied. Since there is both a theoretical and practical component to this module, students should aim to link the theory presented in lectures with the practical sessions and field trip parts of the course. By the end of the module, students should have a knowledge of the underlying principles of biological statistics, be able to evaluate from a theoretical stand-point and in practise, statistical results, and have a sound appreciation of the benefits and limitations of different statistical techniques and their application to field biology.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      DI528 - Conservation Social Science: Methods and Research Design

      
      
       This module introduces students to social science methods and research design - an increasingly important area of expertise in conservation, both in academia and in professional practice.  Students will gain basic training and practical experience in the design and use of (a) qualitative interviews and (b) questionnaires.  Sessions will also be devoted to processing and analysis of qualitative data, and also basic descriptive statistics to analyse quantitative data, but not inferential statistics, since this is covered elsewhere in the BSc programme (DI508).  Towards the end of the module we will look in more depth at the principles of research design in order to help students begin to plan their final year research projects.

      DI530 - Spatial Analysis: Principles and Methods

      
      
       The overall aim of this module is to provide students with an outline of the principals of Spatial Analysis and to introduce a range of methods for collection and analysis of spatial data. Particular attention is paid to the development of students analysis skills through the use of remote sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS are increasingly being used in wildlife conservation and environmental sciences in general to help solve a wide range of real world environmental and associated social problems. As the current trend in ecological studies moves towards the acquisition manipulation and analysis of large datasets with explicit geographic reference, employers often report shortages of relevant GIS skills to handle spatial data. Thus, this module will introduce the use of GIS as a means of solving spatial problems and the potential of GIS and remote sensing techniques for wildlife conservation providing the student with marketable skills relevant to research and commercial needs. Topics will include: understanding the major concepts in Spatial Analysis;  introduction to the principles of GIS;  introduction to remote sensing  data structures in GIS;  data sources and methods of data acquisition  georeferencing, co-ordinate systems and projections  working with raster and vector data mapping (how to create and transform maps), ArcGIS -overview of ArcGIS, ArcMap, ArcCatalog; ArcToolbox, Spatial Analyst. GIS operations (Calculating area, Intersection of polygons etc) manipulation, spatial data query and analysis of a wide range of environmental and socio-economic information relevant to wildlife conservationThese topics will be taught using a combination of lectures and practicals. The practical classes will provide hands-on experience using ArcGIS which is the most widely used GIS system. Students will be able to use knowledge and skills acquired in this module in practical project work.

During the placement you will work under the direction of a designated line manager within the host organisation, with additional support from the University via a named member of academic staff.

You will be working on one or more tasks that are agreed in advance, for example, you may contribute to a management plan, a policy report, a consultation process, a piece of applied research, or development of a set of educational materials.
  


   

 




  
  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      DI518 - Contemporary Conservation Science

      
      
       Conservationists must continually analyse relevant and topical issues in a broad, real-world context. This includes understanding contemporary research, critically evaluating its ecological, evolutionary and interdisciplinary basis, and using this information to inform effective solutions to conservation problems that are embedded in social, political and economic reality. In this module, students will use and apply knowledge/skills gained throughout their degree programme during in-depth discussions of how current research programmes, as presented at the weekly DICE seminars, fit into the wider conservation context. In addition, they will write up these evaluations as a series of News and Views style commentary articles, as published in the top international journal Nature.

      DI522 - Research Project

      
      
       The module is considered as an important element of Wildlife Conservation undergraduate training.  The opportunity to engage in personal research is seen as an essential element of academic training in all disciplines.  The particular skills necessary to undertake research, whether practical fieldwork or laboratory work or a desk-based study, can only be taught through the medium of practically orientated investigative tasks.  The principle objective in the research project is to assist students in gaining insight into the organisation, analysis and communication of research.  The approved investigation may be novel i.e. one that has not previously been carried out, or it may repeat previously executed work for comparative or control purposes.   

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DI527 - Practical Guiding and Interpretation

      
      
       The purpose of this module is to provide students with both a theoretical and working knowledge and understanding of guiding and interpretation (where interpretation is seen as educational activity that aims to reveal meaning and relationships through the use of first hand experience and illustrative media, rather than simply communicating factual information). In offering a rigorous, academic understanding of the subject area, as well as engaging with basic background facts and issues the lectures will cover the theoretical context of each subtopic, whether this is for example, the historical development of guiding, the process of storytelling, or the nature of factual information. Seminars will address the theoretical and evidential background covered in the lectures, address questions and issues that arise, critically examine relevant literature, and consider the practical implications in relation to guiding and interpretation. They will also assess examples of guiding from other sites, discuss and inform students private study activities, and include visits to potential guiding sites on campus. Lectures and seminars will be complemented by student presentation exercises and practical guiding and critique sessions. The final assessment will be of a short guided tour of campus focussed on a specific subject/theme, plus a written descriptive and analytical report that sets this tour within the wider theoretical and research framework. Successful completion of the module will enhance prospects of employment and business set-up in conservation and related heritage tourism industriesTopics covered   What guiding and interpretation are + their history, development and importance The visitor experience  expectations, the visit event and outcomes Preliminary site surveys and information gathering  Improving presentation and interpretative skills Developing fact lists and interpretative materials  The nature of narrative and the narrative of nature  Guiding and interpretation in practice I Planning, risk assessment and customer care Guiding and interpretation in practice II

      DI520 - Conservation and Communities

      
      
       The driving causes of biodiversity loss are not just ecological, but also political, economic and cultural, and conservationists need to acquire the knowledge and skills to address broader social contexts. This module aims to introduce students to cutting-edge debates about the place of local people in biodiversity conservation, and provide them with an overview of the essential role that the social sciences play in the analysis of environmental issues. Objectives of the module are to provide students with a broad conceptual understanding of the social context of conservation, and particularly of the importance of politics and economics; knowledge of the history of conservation approaches towards local communities; familiarity with key issues in the implementation of community conservation; and

      DI521 - Species Conservation

      
      
       This module examines the methods required to recover small populations, and highlights case histories which have succeeded or failed for particular reasons.  After an appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages of such a strategy, this module will address both the issues and the methodologies involved with species conservation programmes.  This will lead on to a reappraisal of particular approaches to species conservation, including captive-breeding, reintroduction, translocation, control of predators, and the field infrastructures which need to be in place to carry out these activities.

      DI510 - Global Biodiversity

      
      
       The aim of this module is to explore the evolutionary, ecological and biological concepts underlying biodiversity. Patterns of species richness, endemism and extinction risk will be examined at different spatial scales using recently available global datasets for mammals, birds and amphibians. We will consider the abiotic and biotic processes that explain these patterns including: - climatic, latitudinal and altitudinal gradients; topography; productivity; habitat heterogeneity and human population density. The main anthropogenic threats to biodiversity will also be examined including habitat loss, fragmentation, over-exploitation and invasive species. Finally, predictive models of future biodiversity loss will be appraised.

      DI501 - Climate Change and Conservation

      
      
       This module will inform students how climate has influenced the diversity of life on Earth, from past to present. The role that anthropogenic factors have played in contemporary climate change since the commencement of the industrial era will be examined in detail, in addition to considering their possible effect on future climatic scenarios. The impact of climate change on individual organisms, populations and communities will be investigated, with particular emphasis given to understanding how species are responding. Human impacts from and vulnerabilities to global warming will also be considered. The module will explore how conservation biologists are using particular interventions to ameliorate the most harmful and destabilising effects of climate change. From a more general perspective, the social, economic and political ways in which climate change can be mitigated will be assessed.

      SE580 - Primate Behaviour and Ecology

      
      
       This module introduces students to the discipline of behavioural ecology, with particular reference to non-human primates. The module looks at the patterns and principles that can be generalised from the variation in behaviour and ecology across primate species. Set within an evolutionary behavioural-ecological framework, this module combines established findings with the latest research. It emphasises the importance of direct observations of primate behaviour and the use of theoretical models with which to make sense of these data. The module covers social and reproductive behaviour within primate groups, the nature and evolution of primate societies, and cognition and communication, as well as interactions between primates and their environments: primates as foragers, predators and prey. The module will make particular use of multi-media technology to allow students to see and hear primates in their natural habitats.

      SE582 - Comparative Perspectives in Primate Biology

      
      
       This module will provide the fundamental theoretical and comparative perspective that lies at heart of biology, with a particular focus on the order Primates. Particular attention will be paid to the evolutionary history of the primates and comparative primate (skeletal) anatomy, both placed in an evolutionary ecological context (e.g. a consideration of dentition in relation to diet and feeding; post-cranial anatomy in relation to locomotion and phylogenetic trends). Extensive use of casts of primate skeletal material will provide hands-on experiential learning. The module will provide a detailed treatment of natural and sexual selection as key components of evolutionary theory that shape the adaptations of organisms, and the way adaptations are used to make sense of the diversity of organisms with particular reference to the primates. It complements, and is complemented by, SE580 Primate Behaviour and Ecology.

      LW585 - Environmental Law I

      
      
       Environmental law involves the study of those areas of law which concern the threats to environmental quality and ecosystems brought about by a variety of human impacts, especially those involving pollution and the unsustainable use of natural resources. The subject represents both a pressing area of public concern and an increasingly important area of legal practice. Environmental Law I is focused upon those parts of environmental law which are most relevant to avoiding pollution of the environmental media of water, air and land. The module commences with a discussion of the foundational concepts of the subject, including the meaning of the environment, pollution and sustainable development in law. These ideas are then related to environmental quality legislation, concerned with public health and pollution controls in respect of different environmental media. After examining sectoral approaches to pollution control, the module then considers cross cutting issues, such as access to environmental information and alternative approaches to environmental regulation which utilise market mechanisms. In each case the object is to place discussion of national and European Community environmental laws in context, by considering how effectively they function as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development. These themes are pursued further in Environmental Law II, which is primarily concerned with the regulation of land use for environmental purposes and the legal protection afforded to biodiversity.

      DI531 - Human Wildlife Conflict and Resource Competition

      
      
       Human-wildlife conflicts and resource competition imply costs on human social, economic or cultural life and on the ecological, social or cultural life of wildlife concerned, often to the detriment of conservation objectives and socio-economic realities. This module aims to introduce students to the magnitude and multidisciplinary dimensions of human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) and resource competition, and current approaches and challenges in mitigating and preventing HWC. We will explore how theoretical frameworks for approaching HWC are most often confined within disciplinary boundaries and how more holistic approaches can better equip conservationists and other professionals in dealing with the issue. Using a variety of teaching and learning methods, students will learn about issues involved in determining and analysing HWC, and planning, implementing and evaluating conflict mitigation or prevention schemes.

       Creative Conservation will engage students with a range of ways of thinking critically about conservation issues and their communication whilst developing their own creative practice and skills portfolio. The approach will seek to take a truly interdisciplinary approach, exploring these issues form a range of disciplinary perspectives and seeking syntheses and new imaginings in addressing them. Topics of focus will be chosen from amongst: History of place and the relationship with nature  esp. East Kent and the Blean Photography - and the use of the still image Video - as representation and a research tool Art and Conservation - craftwork, eco-regional design and natural resource utilisation The Wildlife Documentary - a critical deconstruction and analysis Conservation, Religion and Culture Campaigning for Conservation Conservation and Agriculture Literature and Storytelling Conservation and Cuisine - benefit or burden to the conservation mission? Performance Ethnography - a theoretical framework for action research in conservationIn each case the theoretical, as well as the applied practical aspects of the topic will form a core component of the learning and teaching.

      DI535 - Tropical Ecology and Conservation

      
      
       This residential module is designed to provide students with first-hand experience of ecological processes, biodiversity and conservation issues associated with humid tropical environments. Tropical rainforests are the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth and the loss of rainforest is of tremendous conservation concern, both due to loss of diversity as well as its consequences for global warming. Topics to be covered in the curriculum include: Ecological processes and services in tropical rainforests including nutrient cycling, decomposition, pollination and seed dispersal.  Rainforest structure and defining characteristics of pristine and disturbed habitats.  Rainforest community ecology and tropical forests as centres of ecological diversification and biodiversity. Practical training in ecological techniques and survey methods for a range of terrestrial taxonomic groups.  Anthropogenic factors affecting rainforests including logging, fragmentation, global warming & agriculture.The module will take place in a field studies centre at a rainforest location where there is an adequate infrastructure to ensure an acceptable standard of logistical support and health and safety conditions. Students will spend time working in forest and non-forest systems, and there will be an emphasis on practical training in ecological survey and assessment methods. Teaching on conservation will be integrated with short visits to surrounding sites to gain direct appreciation of the issues, problems and solutions surrounding rainforests and their wildlife. Participation in the module will be dependent on maintaining a clean disciplinary record during registration on the degree programme prior to the module. These requirements may be waived in individual cases at the discretion of the module and programme convenors where we judge that there is a strong case for allowing the student onto the module.

      DI533 - Professional Placements

      
      
       The aim of the module is to provide students with the opportunity to spend a year (minimum 24 weeks) working in a professional environment, applying and enhancing the knowledge, skills and techniques that they have acquired in Stages 1 and 2 of their degree programme. This may be made up of a single placement of at least 24 weeks or of two or more shorter placements that together add up to at least 24 weeks. Individual placements will involve one or more defined roles or tasks; for example placements may involve contributing to, producing or carrying out (i) a piece of research; (ii) a management plan or other management tool; (iii) a policy report, a piece of law or policy or its implementation; (iv) an exercise related to the storage and systematisation of data sets; (v) facilitation, planning and coordination of a consultation process or an event (vi) development of educational, awareness-raising or advocacy materials or activities. The work they do is entirely under the direction of their line manager at each placement, but support is provided via a named member of academic staff within the School (the 'Placement coordinator' for each student). This support includes ensuring that the work they are being expected to do is such that they can meet the learning outcomes of the module.Participation in this module is dependent on students obtaining an appropriate placement or placements. It is also normally dependent on maintaining a clean disciplinary record during their registration on the degree programme up to the time of their placement, although these requirements may be waived in individual cases at the discretion of the module and programme convenors where we judge that there is a strong case for allowing the placement to go ahead. Students who do not meet these conditions will normally be required to transfer to the appropriate programme without a Year in Professional Practice.

       Credits: 120 credits (60 ECTS credits).
