 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      IT312 - History of Italian Cinema:The Legacy of Neo-Realism

      
      
       This course will introduce the students to the work of some of the major Italian filmmakers who contributed to Neorealism's aesthetics and contents (Rossellini, De Sica, De Santis, Fellini) and those who have been inspired by them from the Fifties to the present. Through the study of the history of Italian cinema, students will become familiar with some of the most relevant issues of the history of Italian culture and society. The course will focus particularly on some periods of the history of both Italian cinema and Italian society:- The 1940s: Neorealism as a rejection of the fascist film industry ('Telefoni bianchi/White Telephones' and 'Calligrafi/Calligraphers') and as a way of representing Italian society in the years between the fall of fascism and the birth of the Italian Republic. - The legacy of Neorealism in the Fifties: Fellini - the decline of Neorealism into the so-called Pink Neorealism during the years of 'Ricostruzione (Reconstruction) and the Cold War- The legacy of Neorealism and its influence on Hollywood mainstream industry (with special focus on gangster films)- The legacy of Neorealism on contemporary Italian cinema (e.g. Moretti, Sorrentino, Garrone).

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      IT315 - An Introduction to Italian

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to Italian Literature and Culture through the centuries (from the Unification to the late XX century). Its principal objective will be to set representative works of a number of key Italian writers and intellectuals, such as: D'Annunzio, Montale, Ungaretti, Pasolini, Levi, and the Futurists, in their socio-historical and cultural background.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HA315 - Introduction to Contemporary Art

      
      
       This course aims to draw on both the history and theory of art in order to present a wide range of contemporary forms of art and artistic practice, and to articulate some key distinctions useful for addressing the question of the place of art in culture.  In particular, a discussion of ideas of the avant-garde, of modernity and postmodernism will be relevant here.  The course will explore, through pursuing general themes and case studies of particularly controversial art objects, the different means by which our notions of art and of the artist are 'framed' today, and it will therefore both inform students' broader study of the history of art and complement their individual artistic practice. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA355 - Introduction to the History of Art

      
      
       The module is intended as an introduction to the History of Art, as a body of visual artefacts and as an academic discipline.  It is intended to be accessible to those with little or no previous experience, but also stimulating and informative to students with more background knowledge. The approach is chronological, focussing on a sequence of canonical works of art produced within the Western tradition.  Such works provide a frame for introducing students to many of the basic analytical concepts and terms routinely deployed by art historians in describing, analysing and interpreting works of art: period, style, iconography, meaning, material/medium, technique, composition, creative process, representation, tradition, social function, patronage, genre etc.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      IT301 - Learning Italian - Beginners

      
      
        This is an intensive module in Italian for students who have no or very little knowledge of the language. This course will be of particular interest to anyone wishing to widen their knowledge of Romance languages and to those intending to spend time in Italy. Key basic grammatical structures will be taught through the means of purpose-designed Italian language course books. The students will use the exercise book to carry out grammar exercises at home, which will then be corrected in class. The students will practice their aural skills by listening to audiotapes and videos both in and outside the class. Each chapter of the coursework book is theme based (travelling, shopping, family, etc.). The students will learn how to write and speak in Italian by acquiring new vocabulary, key grammatical points and by carrying out role-plays / presentations. All these aspects relate to the themes in the coursework book. A range of materials will be provided to the student and will for the basis for discussions, translations and applied exercises. Some cultural background of Italy will be provided (e.g. geography, art, music, culinary etc.) The students will also be expected to carry out simple translations from Italian to English / English to Italian. The texts provided will be extracted from the web or the coursework book itself. These translations will also relate to the themes covered in each chapter of the coursework book. By the end of the course the student will have covered key grammatical areas including: the present tense, the future, the gerund, and basic pronouns.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      IT552 - Italian Short Story

      
      
       This module focuses on a number of Italian contemporary short stories. More specifically, it discusses the literary treatment of love, and the love story, in the short stories of some of the most important Italian writers of the second half of the 20th century and early 21st century. Works by worldwide renowned authors such as Italo Calvino, Natalia Ginzburg, Cesare Pavese and Leonardo Sciascia, accomplished "postmodernist" writers belonging to a younger generation such as Antonio Tabucchi and Pier Vittorio Tondelli, as well as less celebrated authors such as Gianni Celati, Erri De Luca and Fabrizia Ramondino will be taken into consideration. While not underestimating the profound economic, social and political changes that Italy underwent during the last sixty years, particular emphasis will be given to the similar way in which all these writers seem to fictionally conceive of the love relationship as a missed encounter. In spite of the manifold forms of love being described in these texts (between husband and wife; wife and lover; young boy and ideal father; sister and brother; mother and daughter; two young men, etc.), all the short stories chronologically analysed in this module seem to rely on Calvino's provoking suggestion according to which the missed encounter is the "fundamental element" of love relationships.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      IT556 - Catching the Tide: Cultural Renewal in 20th Century Italy

      
      
       Despite her incomparable heritage, Italy experienced for many centuries a sense of cultural provincialism, with the world's intellectual curiosity switching to Paris, London, New York and other centres of innovation. This module focuses on the clear connections between rapid socio-economic and socio-political change and the thrust for cultural modernity that made 20th century Italy once more a key contributor to the literary and visual arts in Europe and beyond. A wide variety of Italian "texts" of the first seventy years of the 20th century will be taken into consideration, including novels, plays, short stories and films.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      HA595 - Visual Arts Writing

      
      
        This module will be for final year students who are interested in gaining employment within the art and heritage press and/or marketing sectors. It will complement the vocational and work-based emphasis of the existing HPA Internship module (HA579). It will comprise a series of taught seminars supplemented by visiting speakers from the art/trade press, and from across the marketing and heritage sectors [6-8 speakers per module delivery]. NB: This is not an NCTJ validated course and makes no pretence at providing the full competencies of such. What it will provide will be an introduction to a range of press and related activities within the visual arts and heritage sectors. It will be of relevance for those students considering the possibility of working within these areas and for those who wish to explore some of the practicalities of researching and submitting copy and undertaking related promotional and marketing activities. The module will start by considering examples from the range of trade, specialist and institutionally affiliated publications which service the art and heritage markets. It will consider their target readerships, commissioning practices and particular subject and industry angles. Publications such as The Antiques Trade Gazette, The Art Newspaper, Tate Magazine and Art Monthly will be among those evaluated. Seminars will introduce some of the basic principles of trade writing: standing up and presenting copy proposals for commissioning; adapting copy to differing house-styles; preparing for and undertaking interviews for writing briefs and useful sources of information for generating ideas for prospective writing projects. Seminars will also consider the arts-related promotional work typically undertaken by press and marketing departments within auction houses, public art galleries and within government-funded organisations such as the British Council, and those local and regional authorities with heritage related responsibilities and sections (Canterbury City Council, Medway Unitary Authority etc).

      HA671 - Beauty in Theory, Culture and Contemporary Art

      
      
       After decades of neglect, beauty has made a controversial return both in contemporary art and as a concept in contemporary aesthetics, art theory and criticism.  The module examines the issues raised by this recent resurgence of beauty. Looking at the concept of beauty, the role of beauty in culture and society, and its presence in contemporary art and theory, the module explores the issues that make the return of beauty such a controversial topic.  The module will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines to examine the place of beauty: classic philosophical texts (Plato, Kant, Lessing), contemporary philosophy (Levinson, Gaut, Nehamas, Walton, Zangwill, Hepburn), cognitive and evolutionary science (McMahon, Etcoff), art criticism (Danto, Hickey, Beckley), art history (Gombrich, Clark), sociology and cultural theory (Wolff). In addition, a range of traditional, modern and contemporary artists will be discussed, including Goya, Warhol, Orlan, Duchamp, Picasso, Goldsworthy, Rubens, Ofili, Poussin, Serrano, Metsys, Velazquez, Motherwell, Rembrandt, Mangold.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      HA676 - Transatlantic Dialogues: British and Modern Art c.1900-1970

      
      
       The development of British and American art reveals patterns of affinity, divergence and mutual interplay, against a backdrop of the wider of an international Modernism centred to a large degree on Paris. This module examines such themes as the following: the currency and influence of realist, abstract, and surrealist aesthetics in the first decades of the 20th century(focussing on figures such as Walter Sickert, Edward Hopper, Ben Nicholson, Stuart Davis, Henry Moore); the impact of the Second World War (and of Picassos Guernica as an exemplary artistic response to conditions of war); the emergence after the war of painterly abstraction (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Peter Lanyon), alongside new approaches to expressive figuration (Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon); the development of constructed sculpture (David Smith, Anthony Caro) and post-painterly abstraction (Frank Stella, Bridget Riley) on either side of 1960; parallel manifestations of Pop, Minimalist, Conceptual and Land Art (Richard Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Richard Long, Robert Smithson); attitudes to photography as an artistic and documentary medium (Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus).

      HA679 - From Warhol to Whiteread: Postmodernity & Visual Art Practice

      
      
       This module explores a range of neo-avant-garde and post-war art practice from the 1960s through to the contemporary; from the Minimalism & Pop Art of the 1960s through to the YBAs and after. It will introduce and discuss some of the key artistic figures within the period, exploring their practice, critical contexts and legacy. Taking a thematic approach to one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse art historical periods, we will consider a range of genres  painting, sculpture, installation, performance and land art  exploring how artists have re-defined and developed their practice in the cultural period following Modernism. Artists exampled will typically include Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gilbert & George, Eva Hesse, Jenny Saville, Yinka Shonibare, Gerhard Richter and Rachel Whiteread.

      HA680 - Classicism and Baroque

      
      
       The organising principle of this course is derived from Giovanni Pietro Belloris Vite de Pittori et Architetti Moderni (1672). In selecting a small group of twelve exemplary artists for his history, Bellori was employing artistic biography to expound his theory of art based on the Idea. This charted a middle way between naturalism and mannerism, through which the imitation of nature informed by the principles of antique art produced works which surpassed nature. Among the artists included in Belloris corpus are Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Michelangelo da Caravaggio, and the non-Italian artists Nicolas Poussin, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. Several of the leading artists of the period were excluded from the canon, notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Bellori presumably had these artists in mind when he condemned his contemporaries who juggle madly with corners, gaps and twirling lines, discompose bases, capitals and columns with stucco nonsense, trivial ornament and disproportions. The aesthetic and theoretical judgements which informed Belloris exclusion of artists from his book can be glimpsed in this quote. In the art historical literature on this period such critical judgements are explained in terms of the dichotomy between classicism and the baroque (although these were not terms used in the period). Following Riegl and W&ouml;lfflin the baroque has been defined in opposition to classic art, as an art of becoming rather than of being, addressing the emotions, rather than the intellect, through a tactile evocation of appearances. Often the theoretical writing of the period has been characterised as reacting against, or irrelevant to, what was truly innovative about the work of baroque artists like Bernini and Borromini. These generalisations will be tested through close study of the works of the artists named above, and also by exploring how they might relate to contemporary artistic debates, such as those at the French Acad&eacute;mie Royale about the relative merits of Poussin and Rubens, or between Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona in Rome over the number of figures which should be included in a narrative painting. In addition to exploring the acute interest in stylistic criticism during the seventeenth century, the study of individual artists will also involve consideration of the role played by their patrons, especially their ideological, religious and antiquarian concerns. Although the course will progress by studying individual artists in roughly chronological order, the treatment will be thematic rather than monographic. Lectures at the beginning and end of the course will introduce and summarise the more general historiographical themes; the remaining lectures will be on artists including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Bernini, Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, Poussin, Rubens and Van Dyck.

      HA657 - Photographic History & Aesthetics 1: Realism in Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module begins with an exploration of the history and pre-history of the invention of various photographic technologies, along with the early uses to which these technologies were put. Particular attention is given to the early cultural and intellectual impact of the invention of photography, especially its use as a recorder of the appearance. After considering an example of the kind of predominate modernist art theory that made photography problematic as a realist art form, the emergence and development of realist photographic theory in various guises is explored through a number of key authors and seminal texts. Having explored a wide variety of realist theories, the difficulties of reconciling a realist photographic practice with traditional accounts of aesthetic significance is discussed along with possible responses. The module closes by considering the rise of digital imaging and the end of the realist aesthetic among fine art photographers, as well as exploring the implications of this new technology for our understanding of what a photograph is.

      HA661 - Art & Film

      
      
       Art & Film will explore the longstanding relationship between these visual media and the different ways this relationship has been conceived and evolved over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first century. Though special emphasis will be placed on the post second world war period, which has seen artists and filmmakers increasingly exploring intermediality, the course will begin by examining the field of visuality out of which cinema emerged and will look at the shared visual traditions that existed between them within the rapidly changing visual culture of the nineteenth century. The development of cinema and photography will be examined in relation to new technologies for the production of visual knowledge and imagery and the new modes of spectating that accompanied their inception. The influence of traditions of painting on early cinema will be studied in relation to shared codes of gesture, composition and tableaux, but the course will also assess the early influence of cinema on painting. In this context the development of serialism in art in the late 1880s will receive special attention.The course will then look at both early experimental film within the context of modernist and avant garde practice in the first part of the twentieth century and Hollywood filmmakers in the 1920s and 30s, whose films continued to make overt references to Academic and non-Academic traditions of painting. The module will examine the impact of theories of modernism on the evolution of film and art before moving on to consider the way artists and filmmakers have engaged with the issue of intermediality in the post-1945 era.In the context of studying particular artists, filmmakers and movements in the visual arts, students will be engaging with a range of thematic and aesthetic issues that cut across the boundaries of different visual media, exploring questions about perspective, colour and light, movement, montage, temporality, narrative and resistance to narrative, and the transposition of one medium into another, (e.g. the portrayal of painting, photography, drawings, prints and sculpture in film and other media). During the course students will deepen their understanding of the impact of critical theories on art and culture on the production and reception of works of visual art by being introduced to key critical texts. Within this context the course will also look at institutional frameworks and settings (e.g. the museum, the gallery, the cinema etc.) in which works of art and films are produced and viewed, examining how these settings inflect the experience of those works.

      HA663 - Abstraction & Construction in the 20th Century

      
      
       The development of Abstract Art is one of the distinctive features of the 20th Century. This module examines the roots of the aspiration to allow the object to evaporate like smoke in European and Russian art, and the establishment of Constructivism as a central force in artistic practice in 20th century art. The spiritual, philosophical and social ideas (and ideals) of key artists (such as Malevich, Tatlin, Kandinsky, Mondrian and Klee) are considered in relation to their artistic practice; the work and ideas of American abstractionists are addressed through an examination of legendary figures such as Rothko, Pollock and Stella; discussion of Nicholson, Moore, and de Sta&euml;l, among others, enables us to think about the response of the British and European artworld to the challenges and opportunities of abstraction and construction. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists make use of this radical tradition. Throughout the module we will raise the question of how to make, think about and respond to an art without objects.

      HA507 - Reading the Image

      
      
       The module examines the development of the western tradition of the visual arts from the Renaissance to the late twentieth century, looking specifically at issues about the representation of time and space in painting and related arts.  The module begins with the invention of linear and atmospheric perspective in the Renaissance and looks at the development of these compositional techniques and the tradition of visual illusion they underpin in Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries.  The course looks at the theories of Alberti and Humanist writers and in particular the role played by perspective in advancing the narrative tradition of painting.  The module goes on the examine the critique of the Renaissance tradition in the later 19th Century and the breaking away from the tradition of perspective in modernist painting.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      IT548 - Italian Cinema and Literature

      
      
       This module discusses contemporary film adaptations (1990s-2000s) taken from four different Italian textual sources (childrens tale, monologue, novel and non-fiction) under the following main aspects: 1.   as "parallel" works which supplement the original literary texts. Films expand, update and adjust the themes of the original literary texts to the historical, social and cultural context in which the adaptations are made. 2.   as works of literary criticism. The way the narrative of a film adaptation is structured and the way a film chooses to selectively focus on some particular episodes and themes is evidence of how the film director critically analyses the literary text and "re-writes" it in the form of a screenplay and in the editing of the material filmed;3.   as an altogether "new" product that structurally differs from the original literary source. Cinema's language relies on signifying images or visual signs that are irreducible to those of written and spoken languages;4.   finally, we will analyse the impact that filmmaking had on the art of writing, assessing the extent to which contemporary novels are often already written with the big screen in mind. We will focus on four emblematic contemporary adaptations: Collodis Pinocchio, adapted by Roberto Benigni, Bariccos Novecento (a monologue), adapted by Tornatore (La leggenda del pianist sulloceano), Ammanitis Io non ho paura, adapted by Gabriele Salvatores, and finally Savianos Gomorra, adapted by Matteo Garrone.

       This module aims at developing students visual literacy within the context of Italian studies, by teaching the skills necessary for the reading of static visual materials, especially photography. Contextually, it aims at developing and enhancing the critical response of students to such imagery, with particular focus on their social, cultural and political context. Photography worldwide has been at the centre of daily life, artistic production and political propaganda for the last century and a half. This holds all the more true for Italy, whose contemporary history as a unified country begins almost at the same time as the popularisation of photography. This module will explore this relationship on a socio-historical basis: It will analyse, among other topics, the portrayal of the Risorgimento; Lombrosos criminological and anthropometric use of photography; pseudo-anthropological photography in colonialist exploits, racism and eugenics; Fascist propaganda; futurism and modernism; neo-realist documentary photography and its influence on photojournalism of the 1960s-70s; the paparazzi, fashion and advertisement; photography and the contemporary visual arts; digital photography and social networks. By means of a close reading of photographic and other visual materials, the students will gain a profound understanding of the practicesideological, political, commercial, aesthetic, socialthat produce such materials within the modern Italian cultural context. 

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      SCL501 - Languages in the Classroom

      
      
       The student will spend one half-day per week for ten weeks in a school. They will observe sessions taught by their designated teacher and possibly other teachers. Later they will act to some extent in the role of a teaching assistant, by helping individual pupils who are having difficulties or by working with small groups. They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a language topic or talk about aspects of University life. They must keep a weekly online journal. Some travel may be required by students taking this module.  In this instance, it should be noted that the University is unable to cover the cost of any such journey.This module is subject to change, pending faculty approval.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      HA507 - Reading the Image

      
      
       The module examines the development of the western tradition of the visual arts from the Renaissance to the late twentieth century, looking specifically at issues about the representation of time and space in painting and related arts.  The module begins with the invention of linear and atmospheric perspective in the Renaissance and looks at the development of these compositional techniques and the tradition of visual illusion they underpin in Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries.  The course looks at the theories of Alberti and Humanist writers and in particular the role played by perspective in advancing the narrative tradition of painting.  The module goes on the examine the critique of the Renaissance tradition in the later 19th Century and the breaking away from the tradition of perspective in modernist painting.

      ART500 - Independent Project

      
      
       Students who wish to take the module must approach a permanent academic member of staff with a proposal, typically in advance of module registration, during the Spring term of the previous year. Students pick a research topic of their choice; however, students are only allowed to register for the module with the permission of a staff member who has agreed to supervise the project, and who has the expertise to do so. Potential supervisors must also ensure before they agree to supervise a project that the resources required to complete the project will be available to the student, and that adequate supervisory support will be available to the student throughout their study on the module.Students will be supported in the preparation and submission of their work by their supervisor, although a central expectation of the module is that students will take increasing responsibility for their learning, consistent with expectations of H-level study.

      HA668 - Transatlantic Dialogues: British and American Art c. 1900-1970

      
      
       The development of British and American art reveals patterns of affinity, divergence and mutual interplay, against a backdrop of the wider of an international Modernism centred to a large degree on Paris. This module examines such themes as the following: the currency and influence of realist, abstract, and surrealist aesthetics in the first decades of the 20th century(focussing on figures such as Walter Sickert, Edward Hopper, Ben Nicholson, Stuart Davis, Henry Moore); the impact of the Second World War (and of Picassos Guernica as an exemplary artistic response to conditions of war); the emergence after the war of painterly abstraction (Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Peter Lanyon), alongside new approaches to expressive figuration (Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon); the development of constructed sculpture (David Smith, Anthony Caro) and post-painterly abstraction (Frank Stella, Bridget Riley) on either side of 1960; parallel manifestations of Pop, Minimalist, Conceptual and Land Art (Richard Hamilton, Jasper Johns, Richard Long, Robert Smithson); attitudes to photography as an artistic and documentary medium (Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Diane Arbus).

      HA504 - Classicism and Baroque

      
      
       The organising principle of this course is derived from Giovanni Pietro Belloris Vite de Pittori et Architetti Moderni (1672). In selecting a small group of twelve exemplary artists for his history, Bellori was employing artistic biography to expound his theory of art based on the Idea. This charted a middle way between naturalism and mannerism, through which the imitation of nature informed by the principles of antique art produced works which surpassed nature. Among the artists included in Belloris corpus are Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Michelangelo da Caravaggio, and the non-Italian artists Nicolas Poussin, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. Several of the leading artists of the period were excluded from the canon, notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Francesco Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. Bellori presumably had these artists in mind when he condemned his contemporaries who juggle madly with corners, gaps and twirling lines, discompose bases, capitals and columns with stucco nonsense, trivial ornament and disproportions. The aesthetic and theoretical judgements which informed Belloris exclusion of artists from his book can be glimpsed in this quote. In the art historical literature on this period such critical judgements are explained in terms of the dichotomy between classicism and the baroque (although these were not terms used in the period). Following Riegl and W&ouml;lfflin the baroque has been defined in opposition to classic art, as an art of becoming rather than of being, addressing the emotions, rather than the intellect, through a tactile evocation of appearances. Often the theoretical writing of the period has been characterised as reacting against, or irrelevant to, what was truly innovative about the work of baroque artists like Bernini and Borromini. These generalisations will be tested through close study of the works of the artists named above, and also by exploring how they might relate to contemporary artistic debates, such as those at the French Acad&eacute;mie Royale about the relative merits of Poussin and Rubens, or between Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona in Rome over the number of figures which should be included in a narrative painting. In addition to exploring the acute interest in stylistic criticism during the seventeenth century, the study of individual artists will also involve consideration of the role played by their patrons, especially their ideological, religious and antiquarian concerns. Although the course will progress by studying individual artists in roughly chronological order, the treatment will be thematic rather than monographic. Lectures at the beginning and end of the course will introduce and summarise the more general historiographical themes; the remaining lectures will be on artists including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Bernini, Borromini, Pietro da Cortona, Poussin, Rubens and Van Dyck.

      HA554 - From Warhol to Whiteread: Postmodernity & Visual Art Practice

      
      
       This module explores a range of neo-avant-garde and post-war art practice from the 1960s through to the contemporary; from the Minimalism & Pop Art of the 1960s through to the YBAs and after. It will introduce and discuss some of the key artistic figures within the period, exploring their practice, critical contexts and legacy. Taking a thematic approach to one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse art historical periods, we will consider a range of genres  painting, sculpture, installation, performance and land art  exploring how artists have re-defined and developed their practice in the cultural period following Modernism. Artists exampled will typically include Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gilbert & George, Eva Hesse, Jenny Saville, Yinka Shonibare, Gerhard Richter and Rachel Whiteread.

      HA556 - Art and Film

      
      
       Art & Film will explore the longstanding relationship between these visual media and the different ways this relationship has been conceived and evolved over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Though special emphasis will be placed on the post second world war period, which has seen artists and filmmakers increasingly exploring intermediality, the course will begin by examining the field of visuality out of which cinema emerged and will look at the shared visual traditions that existed between them within the rapidly changing visual culture of the nineteenth century. The development of cinema and photography will be examined in relation to new technologies for the production of visual knowledge and imagery and the new modes of spectating that accompanied their inception. During the course students will deepen their understanding of the impact of critical theories on art and culture on the production and reception of works of visual art by being introduced to key critical texts. Within this context the course will also look at institutional frameworks and settings (e.g. the museum, the gallery, the cinema etc.) in which works of art and films are produced and viewed, examining how these settings inflect the experience of those works.

      HA559 - Abstraction And Construction in 20th Century Art

      
      
       The development of Abstract Art is one of the distinctive features of the 20th Century. In this module we will examine the roots of the aspiration to allow the object to evaporate like smoke in European and Russian art, and the establishment of Constructivism as a central force in artistic practice in 20th century art. The spiritual, philosophical and social ideas (and ideals) of key artists (such as Malevich, Tatlin, Kandinsky, Mondrian and Klee) are considered in relation to their artistic practice; the work and ideas of American abstractionists are addressed through an examination of legendary figures such as Rothko, Pollock and Stella; discussion of Nicholson, Moore, and de Sta&euml;l, among others, enables us to think about the response of the British and European artworld to the challenges and opportunities of abstraction and construction. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists make use of this radical tradition. Throughout the module we will raise the question of how to make, think about and respond to an art without objects.

      HA575 - Beauty in Theory Culture & Contemporary Art

      
      
       After decades of neglect, beauty has made a controversial return both in contemporary art and as a concept in contemporary aesthetics, art theory and criticism. In very different ways, beauty can be seen in the work of artists as diverse as Vanessa Beecroft, Chris Ofili, Robert Mapplethorpe, Gary Hume and Jenny Saville, and it has been rehabilitated as a critical term in the writings of critics such as Dave Hickey and Arthur Danto.The module examines the issues raised by this recent resurgence of beauty. Looking at the concept of beauty, the roles of beauty in culture and society, and its presence in contemporary art and theory, the module explores the issues that make the return of beauty such a controversial topic. The module will draw on a variety of sources and disciplines to examine the place of beauty: classic philosophical texts (Plato,  Kant, Lessing), contemporary philosophy (Levinson, Gaut, Nehamas, Walton, Zangwill, Hepburn), cognitive and evolutionary science (McMahon, Etcoff), art criticism (Danto, Hickey, Beckley), art history (Gombrich, Clark), sociology and cultural theory (Wolff).  In addition, a range of traditional, modern and contemporary artists will be discussed, including Goya, Warhol, Orlan, Duchamp, Picasso, Goldsworthy, Rubens, Ofili, Poussin, Serrano, Metsys, Velazquez, Motherwell, Rembrandt, Mangold.

      HA595 - Visual Arts Writing

      
      
        This module will be for final year students who are interested in gaining employment within the art and heritage press and/or marketing sectors. It will complement the vocational and work-based emphasis of the existing HPA Internship module (HA579). It will comprise a series of taught seminars supplemented by visiting speakers from the art/trade press, and from across the marketing and heritage sectors [6-8 speakers per module delivery]. NB: This is not an NCTJ validated course and makes no pretence at providing the full competencies of such. What it will provide will be an introduction to a range of press and related activities within the visual arts and heritage sectors. It will be of relevance for those students considering the possibility of working within these areas and for those who wish to explore some of the practicalities of researching and submitting copy and undertaking related promotional and marketing activities. The module will start by considering examples from the range of trade, specialist and institutionally affiliated publications which service the art and heritage markets. It will consider their target readerships, commissioning practices and particular subject and industry angles. Publications such as The Antiques Trade Gazette, The Art Newspaper, Tate Magazine and Art Monthly will be among those evaluated. Seminars will introduce some of the basic principles of trade writing: standing up and presenting copy proposals for commissioning; adapting copy to differing house-styles; preparing for and undertaking interviews for writing briefs and useful sources of information for generating ideas for prospective writing projects. Seminars will also consider the arts-related promotional work typically undertaken by press and marketing departments within auction houses, public art galleries and within government-funded organisations such as the British Council, and those local and regional authorities with heritage related responsibilities and sections (Canterbury City Council, Medway Unitary Authority etc).

      HA586 - Photographic History & Aesthetics 1: Realism in Theory and Practice

      
      
       This module begins with an exploration of the history and pre-history of the invention of various photographic technologies, along with the early uses to which these technologies were put. Particular attention is given to the early cultural and intellectual impact of the invention of photography, especially its use as a recorder of the appearance. After considering an example of the kind of predominate modernist art theory that made photography problematic as a realist art form, the emergence and development of realist photographic theory in various guises is explored through a number of key authors and seminal texts. Having explored a wide variety of realist theories, the difficulties of reconciling a realist photographic practice with traditional accounts of aesthetic significance is discussed along with possible responses. The module closes by considering the rise of digital imaging and the end of the realist aesthetic among fine art photographers, as well as exploring the implications of this new technology for our understanding of what a photograph is. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
