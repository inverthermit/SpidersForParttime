Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.

      EL303 - Electronic Circuits

      
      
       This module is a continuation of EL305 - Introduction to Electronics. It assumes that students already know the main circuit laws and how to use electronic circuit design tools. It then expands this knowledge in providing rigorous fundamentals of analysis of electric circuits with alternating currents. It also introduces basic electronic devices i.e. diodes and transistors; how they work and what properties they have; what their circuit applications are; and how to analyse and design basic circuits with these devices. Students are also taught practical applications of the methods learned, including a complete process of the design, construction and testing of a simple transistor amplifier. Again, similarly as in EL305, an extensive use of computer-aided electronic circuit design tools is made to assist in and to amplify traditional lecture-based learning. Ability to use mathematics (algebra and complex numbers) is required.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

Also, fundamentals of analysis of electric circuits and the main circuit laws are taught. The teaching of this module makes an extensive use of a computer-aided electronic circuit design tools to assist in and to amplify traditional lecture-based learning. It also includes a mini-project in which students gain practical laboratory experience, including design, physical construction and testing of an example operational amplifier circuit.
