The lectures and related seminar programme explain the economic principles underlying the analysis of each topic and relate the theory to the real world and business examples.

The module is carefully designed to tell you what topics are covered under each major subject area, to give readings for these subjects, and to provide a list of different types of questions to test and extend your understanding of the material.

      SE584 - The Anthropology of Business

      
      
       Anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the last third of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion among others. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

      CB688 - Decision Analysis

      
      
       Making decisions is one of the most important things any manager or business must do. Making smart decisions, however, can be extremely difficult due the complexity and uncertainty involved. Decision Analysis (DA) provides a structured and coherent approach to decision making. It involves a wide range of quantitative and graphical methods for identifying, representing, and assessing alternatives in order to determine a best course of action. DA is regularly employed by many leading companies in the pharmaceutical, oil and gas, utilities, automotive, and financial services sectors. In this module, you learn about the basic concepts of DA and how to apply it in a variety of practical business planning situations. An indicative list of topics is provided below. Introduction to decision making: understanding why decisions are hard, the art of making good decisions, the main building blocks of structured decision making. Decision trees: a walk through of the construction and use of decision trees for graphically representing and analysing risky decision problems. Expected value decision criterion: a short introduction to probability theory, how to compute expected values, and the use of an expected value decision criteria for solving decision trees. Alternative decision criteria: different types of risk attitude and a brief overview of alternative decision criteria for incorporating risk attitude. Overview of utility theory: a critical look at expected value and potential problems with using it, the concept of utility and the elicitation of a utility function, the exponential utility function for modelling risk neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking decision makers. Dominance and sensitivity analysis: deterministic and stochastic dominance, tornado diagrams, one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis of probability estimates. Value of information: information and decision making, value of perfect information, value of sample information. Multi-criteria decision making: the analytical hierarchy process, comparing attributes, scoring alternatives, ranking alternatives, checking for consistency.

      CB523 - International Business

      
      
       The internationalisation of commerce and the worlds capital markets has spurred a growing interest in impact and success of foreign business entities in the home country.

The module is taught in two parts. The first part examines the political, economic and cultural environments that affect business. It also explores the determinants of national competitive advantage, the role of government and trade regulations in conducting business, the impact of regional integration and of international organisations such as the IMF and the WTO, the motives and the impact of multinational enterprises. The second part is dedicated to analysing the ways in which international business performs main functions such as human resource management, marketing and finance in an international context.

Case studies are used throughout the module in order to link theory and practice.
