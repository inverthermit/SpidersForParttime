 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CO320 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

      
      
       This module provides an introduction to object-oriented software development.  Software pervades many aspects of most professional fields and sciences, and an understanding of the development of software applications is useful as a basis for many disciplines. This module covers the development of simple software systems. Students will gain an understanding of the software development process, and learn to design and implement applications in a popular object-oriented programming language.  Fundamentals of classes and objects are introduced, and key features of class descriptions:   constructors, methods and fields.  Method implementation through assignment, selection control structures, iterative control structures and other statements is introduced.  Collection objects are also covered and the availability of library classes as building blocks.  Throughout the course, the quality of class design and the need for a professional approach to software development is emphasized

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CO600 - Project

      
      
       The project gives you the opportunity to follow and develop your particular technical interests, undertake a larger and less tightly specified piece of work than you have before (at university), and develop the project organisation, implementation and documentation techniques which you have learnt in other modules. The technical and professional aspects of project courses are seen as particularly important by both employers (who will often bring them up in interviews) and by professional bodies.The project may be self-proposed or may be selected from a list of project proposals. Typically, a project will involve the specification, design, implementation, documentation and demonstration of a technical artefact. The project is supervised by a member of the academic staff, who holds weekly meetings with the group, during which s/he will give general advice and will assess the progress of the group and the contributions by individual students. Project deliverables are:- a technical report, in the style of an academic paper, describing the scientific/technical outcome of the project; - a well-indexed corpus of material that supports the achievements claimed. In addition, each individual prepares a report outlining his/her contributions to each of the various aspects of the project. This report should not be a repeat of other material delivered as part of the project, but an assessment of the progress of the project and reflections on what the individual has learnt from undertaking it. In particular, it should include a description of the particular activities and outcomes that individual has contributed to the project, and of how the group worked together. This report will be discussed at a viva voce examination which should include a short presentation/demonstration of the project. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
