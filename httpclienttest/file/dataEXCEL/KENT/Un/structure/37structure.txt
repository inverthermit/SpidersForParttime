Course structure


The course structure below gives a flavour of the modules that will be available to you and provides details of the content of this programme.  This listing is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take &lsquo;wild&rsquo; modules from other programmes offered by the University in order that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas of interest to you or that may further enhance your employability.




 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      DR315 - Modern Theatre: A Theoretical Landscape

      
      
       In the first section of the module students will explore the ideas of some key theorists and practitioners [particularly Stanislavski and Brecht] on the relation of theatre to the social/political order. A particular focus of discussions will be their theories of the role of the audience/spectator.In the second section of the module we will be exploring the ideas of theatre practitioners who, in opposition to those studied earlier, focus on interiority/the inner self of actor and audience, on the intense physical or emotional or spiritual transaction between actor and spectator, and on the possibilities of a transcultural, even universal, theatre. Amongst those studied will be Artaud, Grotowski, Brook.In the final part of the module we will be exploring the field of contemporary performance, through writings about performance, accounts and recordings of performance, visits, if possible, to performances.  Sometimes called post-modern performance, sometimes liminal performance, the work we will look at is characterised by its relation to/fusion with other arts  fine art, architecture, music, video as well as virtual technology art  and, as a result, by the questions it poses about theatre- what is an actor/ what is [a] theatre?/what is [a] performance?/ what is meaning?/what is a spectator?

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR317 - Texts for Theatre

      
      
       This introductory module provides Stage One Drama students with knowledge and skills that will enable them to work productively with traditional dramatic texts (i.e. play scripts), and to identify and analyse a range of less familiar theatrical texts. Students will learn a specifically theatrical approach to reading and analysing traditional dramatic texts. Students will learn about the process of translating the dramatic text into performance by developing an understanding of: the concept of dramaturgy; the construction of play texts, including the functional importance of plot, character, genre and historical context; the influence of context and approach in creating and interpreting the work.Students will be introduced to less familiar types and notions of texts. This will include the texts developed from and for non-scripted and semi-scripted performance (e.g. Commedia dellArte, stand-up comedy). They will learn to distinguish and read a range of other elements as texts (e.g. the body, sound and culture).In addition, students will be encouraged to develop a greater degree of independence in their research and learning. This will be built via group research tasks and presentations, developing students confidence and skills with the assistance of peer support.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR334 - Stagecraft

      
      
       This module promotes essential technical competence in the various disciplines needed to realise a performance such as lighting, sound, construction and stage management.  After an initial period of instruction in one or more of these areas, students will then develop their practical skills in the context of a realised production. This may involve, for example, offering technical support for performance work by students in other modules. Finally, students will reflect on their work in seminar presentations. Academic staff convene, organise, assess and take the leading role in teaching. Technical staff may also be involved with teaching and technical demonstration. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR337 - The Empty Space

      
      
       This is module not about Peter Brooks work, but about the implications of his idea that anything can be seen as an act of theatre. Students will be invited to see beyond their own default assumptions about theatre, and introduced to a diverse range of methods of devising their own performances. They will learn about warming up, performance skills, and collaborative group work; and will explore the possibilities of creating performance from a range of starting points, including (for example), space, body, voice, text, character or visual stimulus. This will be taught in practical workshops, supplemented by a series of lectures in which different Drama lecturers talk to the students about their own ideas of what theatre is and could be, and how these ideas have been shaped by their encounters with theatre as audience members, theatre makers, and academics. Students will be assessed by two short devised performances, in which they explore their own aesthetic tastes and approaches to theatre; and a piece of writing in which they create their own theatrical manifesto, which reflects on their own experiences of creating and performing theatre in this module, and the ideas they have encountered in the lectures and the reading. This module will offer a solid foundation for all modules in years two, three and four which involve creative performance work.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

 Stage 2

  
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      DR549 - Acting

      
      
       The course will introduce basic skills related to the craft of acting, predominantly within naturalist and realist idioms. This acting course will provide a core practical introduction to mainstream acting techniques descended from the teachings of Stanislavski and his heirs, as well as providing an introduction to contrasting practice and theories from other significant practitioners.The course will introduce students through practical means, to basic terms and concepts in mainstream rehearsal-room practice. The students will develop a practical and usable understanding of a contemporary approach to the Stanislavskian system. Students will explore approaches concerning the use of detailed textual analysis when preparing a naturalistic role for performance and concepts to be introduced will include text analysis and uniting, actions and activities, objectives, obstacles, stakes, and given circumstances. On some level, this course will allow the student to explore varied and contradicting ideas from the world of actor training.All of these concepts will be explored in practice through a combination of physical and text exercises, improvisation and close textual analysis. Students will be encouraged to adopt a critical overview of the work and to evaluate for themselves, both via class discussion and through reflective analysis on paper, the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques to which they are introduced. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR575 - Victorian and Edwardian Theatre

      
      
       This module offers an opportunity to explore an exciting and important period of British Theatre: a period which laid the foundations for the organisation, values and forms of British Theatre throughout much of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian years, as well as WW1, this was a time of radical change in British society and the module examines the theatres relationship with this changing historical, social and cultural context. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR612 - Shakespeare's Theatre

      
      
       This module engages with the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries as texts for performance; approached through a variety of critical, theoretical and practical methods. It considers the theatrical, cultural and historical conditions that produced and shaped them; examines the role played by the drama in a violent, volatile and rapidly-changing society; investigates and applies the principles of early modern playing spaces and performance practices, and considers the variety of ways in which these works have been encountered and reinvented in the modern period.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR594 - Popular Performance

      
      
       Students' learning will be organised around research-based performance projects. These will bebased on detailed examinations of particular popular performance genres (for example, variety theatre, slapstick, cabaret, pantomime, radio comedy). Initially, students develop relevant performance skills, which might include, for example, addressing an audience, developing a stage persona, dance, singing, and/or simple acrobatics. In addition to this, they will be set weekly research tasks relevant to the particular genre they are studying. These tasks will lead towards a research essay, which will typically relate to the piece they go on to perform in the final assessed show. They will work independently on devising and rehearsing material related to both the research and the skills acquired in workshops, testing this material in front of an audience made up of other students on the module in their weekly all student practical session. Subsequently, they will develop their material to create a show in the style of the assigned popular performance genre, which will be performed to a public audience.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR609 - European Naturalist Theatre & Its Legacy

      
      
       This module introduces students to key Naturalist plays of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, drawn from the European repertoire.  It aims to explore the historical context in which Naturalism as a literary and theatrical movement developed and the varied practice of dramatists who sought to represent real life on stage in more accurate and convincing ways.  An understanding of their debts to scientific, cultural, literary, artistic and theatrical debates and movements of the period illuminates a number of key Naturalist theatres texts by Zola, Ibsen, Strindberg, Hauptmann and Chekhov.  The possibilities and limitations of this specialised mode of representation are investigated and its legacy is then traced in a selection of British plays by Lawrence, Wesker, and Peter Gill, that reflect a Naturalist approach or deal specifically with continuing arguments on lifes determining and shaping forces and their dramatic representation first contested in the 19th Century.  The module concludes by considering what might be regarded as a 21st Century form of  Naturalistic British theatre analysing a number of recent productions which might include: Blue/Orange,  Stuff Happens, My Name is Rachel Corrie.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR663 - Physical Theatre 1

      
      
       This module studies different approaches to physical training for performance. It covers examples from around the world, though developments in Europe during the twentieth century provide a focus for the module. The module is oriented towards training for physical theatre  a term which emerged at the end of the twentieth century and refers to a shift away from script, playwright and linear narrative. As such naturalism and the work of Stanislavski do not fall within the remit of this module, and are covered by Acting in Stage II. Students will gain valuable practical experience of physical training in weekly workshops where they will explore the fundamental principles of training the body. These include: Posture, centre, balance, energy, space, tension, relaxation, sound within the body Precision and clarity in movement Presence, spontaneity and improvisationThe module makes elementary investigations into the relationship between training and performance composition, an aspect which will be further explored in Physical Theatre 2 (DR664).Practice will be contextualised by historical and theoretical reading that explores the landscape from which the term Physical Theatre emerged in the twentieth century. Key historical figures include: Jacques Copeau, Antonin Artaud, Edward Gordon Craig, Jerzy Grotowski, Eugenio Barba, Rudolph von Laban and Jacques Lecoq, among others. Grotowskis term Poor Theatre is a crucial starting point for the module, and we explore how a performer might be prepared for a performance style that focuses so fully on the performers body in space, and the demands that come with that style. Eugenio Barbas ideas about pre-expressivity and the study of performer training across different cultures and disciplines are also important. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR667 - Site Specific Performance

      
      
       This module focuses on the emergence and development of site specific performance through the 20th Century and into the 21st Century, interrogating what has progressively become a generic label applied to a range of theatre/performance forms which embrace site however tenuous this relationship might be.The module explores the context in which site becomes the determining feature in the creation of artistic and theatrical works in the mid-20th Century, specifically considering the development of site/land art, installation art, celebratory community theatre and the subsequent influence of this work on the emergence of site specific performance and current practice.  The module will introduce students to a range of practitioners who explore the site of performance from a number of perspectives. Models of site specific approaches may include: the Anthropological/Archaeological illustrated in the work of Brith Gof, the Reclamation and Animation of disused space illustrated in the work of Deborah Warner, Performative Journeys through site illustrated in the work of Lone Twin.  The module will be delivered through seminar/workshops and culminate in a practical project enabling students to explore the possibilities and limitations of the form, theoretical contexts, gain an understanding of a variety of creative approaches to the site and interrogate the efficacy of the term in the 21st Century.   

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR673 - Theatres of the Past 1: the Classics

      
      
       The primary aim of the module is to introduce students to the principles and practices of theatre history, and therefore in order to make best use of the staff teams research specialisms, the historical focus of the curriculum will vary. The module offers not only a study of the major canonical texts of the period but also a detailed exploration of the societal conditions and theatrical realities of its time, allowing for an understanding of theatre as an artistic product of a particular culture.  Modern revivals of classical texts will also be considered, taking account of issues regarding historical and cultural transposition.

      FI590 - Filmmaking: Improvisation for Screen

      
      
       This interdisciplinary module brings Film and Drama Single Honours students together to explore improvisational techniques that increasingly animate both independent filmmaking and contemporary drama practice.  Practical workshops provide technical instruction and creative focus on actors improvisation as a rehearsal technique, a screenplay development technique, and a performance technique during filming. Exploration of improvisation as screen craft will be complemented by the theorisation of improvisation in lectures that also provide a historical context and introduce film artists use of aleatory techniques in production and postproduction, live cinema, and the use of real or improvised dialogue and verbatim accounts in documentary and animated films. Connections between theatrical and cinematic trends that utilise forms of improvisation will be emphasised while students practical projects will respond to and expand upon these growing synergies between cinema and theatre in the digital age.

      DR674 - Performance and Art: Intermediality from Wagner to the Virtuals

      
      
       This module addresses the influence of the early avant-garde on later experimental performance forms such as performance art and multimedia performance. It examines the impact of new technologies on performance and representation throughout the last century, and explores the relationship between media culture and theatre practice. Key modernist and postmodernist practitioners are discussed as the module traces the evolution of intermedial theatre and performance art. Students analyse how time and space manifest within works driven by a visual aesthetic, and focus is placed on the nature of audience engagement and the specific means of communication effective in forms of intermedial theatre. The module also considers questions concerning the live and mediated aspects of performance, and explores concepts such as liveness, the body, remediation and intermediality.

      DR684 - Introduction to Musical Theatre Dance

      
      
       Students will explore the historical and cultural contexts through which the genre of musical theatre dance developed. Learning will be organised around detailed examinations of particular periods of musical theatre dance including its interface with popular dance forms in the 1920s and the emergence of variety and Vaudeville theatre; the integration of Latin, Indian and African influences through the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s; the standardization of jazz in the 1970s; and the influences of ballet, cabaret, and burlesque theatre across the centurys period styles. Weekly workshop sessions will include a comprehensive isolation-based musical theatre/jazz warm-up, followed by movement studies focused in specific periods and the learning of a section of musical theatre dance repertory. In addition, students will view filmed musicals and other performances from specific periods and present critical analyses of these in small groups during seminar classes. Attendance at live musical performances will also be required. These tasks will lead towards a research essay focused on a period, artist, or musical of the students choice. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR685 - Theatre and Adaptation

      
      
       Recent theatrical productions as diverse in form as experimental performance, new writing, West End drama, musicals and live art have shown a recurring fascination with adapting existing works by other artists, writers, filmmakers and stage practitioners. The transition of an existing source or stimulus to the stage  be it film, book, play, artwork, or other performance  is not a smooth one. It implies negotiations of numerous kinds, such as interlingual and intercultural, but also ideological, ethical, aesthetic and political. Drawing on the work of contemporary theatre-makers, this module will explore specific approaches to stage adaptation, study adaptation methodologies and develop an understanding of the implications of adaptation. Through seminar discussions, practical and creative work, the module will prompt a reflection on performances near-obsessive desire to return, repeat, rewrite and revisit, establishing a dialogue across languages and cultural identities. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                     
      DR683 - Performing Philosophy

      
      
       The delivery of this module will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the module the students will attend a series of five lectures on fundamental questions within the philosophy of theatre, such as the ethics of representation, the ontology of live performance and the extent to which performance can be philosophy. Alongside these lectures, the students will attend weekly seminars in which they discuss these ideas and their applicability to contemporary practice. This half will culminate in an essay responding to one of the themes covered in the class. In the second half of the module, the lectures will be replaced by a series of 3-hour workshops in which the students will practically explore a given text. Alongside this practical work, the students will read different philosophical exegeses of this text, and in the seminars we will discuss how the readings of these philosophers relate to their broader philosophical projects, what light they shed on the work in question, and how they might inform a production of it. (As an example, in a project on Endgame we might look at the work of Adorno, Cavell and Critchley). This half will culminate in a short performance of the work, which will be assessed alongside a portfolio outlining how this performance has been informed by their research. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      ART500 - Independent Project

      
      
       Students who wish to take the module must approach a permanent academic member of staff with a proposal, typically in advance of module registration, during the Spring term of the previous year. Students pick a research topic of their choice; however, students are only allowed to register for the module with the permission of a staff member who has agreed to supervise the project, and who has the expertise to do so. Potential supervisors must also ensure before they agree to supervise a project that the resources required to complete the project will be available to the student, and that adequate supervisory support will be available to the student throughout their study on the module.Students will be supported in the preparation and submission of their work by their supervisor, although a central expectation of the module is that students will take increasing responsibility for their learning, consistent with expectations of H-level study.

      DR675 - Theatres of the Past 2: the Moderns

      
      
       The primary aim of the module is to introduce students to the principles and practices of theatre history, and therefore in order to make best use of the staff teams research specialisms, the historical focus of the curriculum will vary. The module offers not only a study of dramatic texts and other forms of documentation from the period in question but also a detailed exploration of the societal conditions and theatrical realities of its time, and its engagement with the conditions of modernity, allowing for an understanding of theatre as an artistic product of a particular culture.This module introduces you to a fascinating area of theatre largely ignored by historians and theatre practitioners: the theatre of the First World War (1914-1918). Over the course of the module as well as studying and practically exploring plays of and about WW1, you will examine the social, theatrical, and political context of the war. Throughout you will be exploring the different answers to the question 'How does the theatre respond to the First World War?'. As part of this we might explore the different ways in which plays represented the trenches for people at home and soldiers who had experienced the real thing; the ways that theatre cultivated a spy hysteria at the start of the war; and the different techniques that playwrights used to criticise the war without being banned. In exploring these topics, throughout the module you will undertake a variety of research and performance tasks and will have a chance to work with a diversity of archival sources in exploring these long-forgotten theatrical works. This work will all lead towards a final group performance workshop in which you will present your findings from your research.

      DR676 - Introduction to Stand Up

      
      
       This module will introduce students to practical and theoretical aspects of stand-up comedy. Initially, they will analyse the work of individual comedians, exploring such issues as comic theory, traditions of stand-up, and historical context. Later, they will work on creating their own short stand-up acts, generating original material and developing key performance skills such as developing persona, working an audience, improvisation, and characterisation.

      DR678 - Creative Project

      
      
       The module will offer students the chance to work on an independent creative project of their own devising, which will be a culmination of practical elements of their degree programme. Performance, workshop, design, stagecraft, producing or other creative skills encountered in earlier modules will be developed, extended and explored in autonomous work, which will be supported by regular group supervision sessions. Projects will also involve research which will contextualise the practical elements. The practical elements will be supplemented by a portfolio which will document the creative process. Typically, this will collect contextual research, include analytical reflection and may include audio and/or video material, photographs, drawings, etc.

      DR664 - Physical Theatre II

      
      
       The module explores physical theatre as a complex and rich term which describes works focusing on the primacy of the body in performance rather than text or character. It will focus on how Physical Theatre practitioners have deployed compositional techniques, and the principals that underlie such work. It differs from Physical Theatre 1 in focussing less on training for performance and much more on composition and different possibilities of structuring Physical Performance, using space, sound, movement, rhythm and the body.Students will conduct in-depth investigations into the relationship between training and performance and devising techniques and compositional approaches through weekly practical workshops. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR610 - Performing Lives: Theory & Practice of Autobiographical Theatre

      
      
       This module explores critical and creative approaches to working with real lives in performance. You will examine how auto/biographical material is used and manipulated to construct identity in and through performance. You will question the concept of the 'true story' and explore the ethics and practicalities of using the personal in performance. You will also work creatively to produce a practical project on auto/biographical theatre. In this module you will work with a range of dramatic material and forms, studying, for example, play texts, performance art, verbatim and documentary theatre. You will also engage with a range of theoretical approaches and perspectives. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR629 - Cultural Policies in the British Theatre

      
      
       The period from 1985 has seen theatre move from a neglected area of government policy, surviving with reducing and standstill investment, through to being recognised as not only a popular art form, but as an element of the glue that creates and binds communities. This ushered in a period of greater intervention by politicians and policy makers from the local to the central government level. This module will look at the policy and public funding structures for Theatre and Drama, including the formation of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and the Arts Council and its various models of operation since 1947.  It will debate the current changes being introduced and the funding environment. The module draws on external speakers, including artistic directors and managers from theatres and funding experts, to help develop an understanding of the arts funding environment and explore what makes a successful arts funding application.  Those taking the module will develop their own creative idea and gain an understanding of how this idea can achieve Arts Council support.  The module assesses the ability to deliver a creative idea, including how audiences will be developed and how the project will be financed and managed, to help achieve the Arts Councils mission of Great art and culture for everyone.  Overall, this module serves to place Theatre and Drama production within the context of who makes policy and how it is formed, while acting as an introduction to arts funding and the application and measurement process.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR659 - Performing Classical Texts

      
      
       The aim of this 12 week course is to introduce students to the specific acting challenges presented by the classical texts and his contemporaries and to facilitate, through practice, an in depth examination of proven analytical and practical approaches to these challenges.  Instruction in the analysis of language structure and verse forms, verse structure, style, metre, imagery and language texture forms a key component to this course.Through a classical repertoire, the student will be taught a systematic analysis of verse structure which, they will learn, is an integral part of an actors development. This work on unambiguous structural matters will enable the student actor to articulate experience in time, avoiding the risk of leaving performance at the level of the pursuit of feeling and expression. Focus will also be placed on how this analysis can direct the performer, facilitating discovery in both action and character.The course will also create an awareness of the vocal, physical and emotional demands placed on the performer when working with these plays and through practice, promote knowledge of how the actors instrument can meet these demands.The module will run in two parts with weeks one to four focusing on the demands of the verse monologue and its performing challenges, culminating in a solo performance assessment. The remaining weeks (6  11), will explore performance text analysis when working with group scenes and how this analysis can direct the performer. The course will close in week 12 with assessed practical scene performances taken from classical texts accompanied by a written scene analysis for later submission.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      DR548 - Theatre & Journalism

      
      
       The aims of this module are to allow students the opportunity to extend their knowledge of theatre by encounters with contemporary performance as a live, time-based experience rather than as the experience of reading/text, and to enable them to develop the skills of analysis and journalistic writing about live performance. The module introduces students to contextual knowledge on contemporary theatre and performance journalism in the UK, including aspects of editing and copyediting. It develops analytical and writing skills while considering the role of the critic, the demands of theatre reviewing as a craft and the basics of journalism in general. Where possible, sessions will be conducted by professional theatre critics. The module trains students on how to make formal presentations, write reviews and features, copyedit/subedit their own or other peoples work, pitch to an editor, and tailor ones writing style according to different readerships and publications. Each seminar group will work towards the publication of a blog, in which coursework will be published.The central part of the module is focused around 5 or 6 visits to live performances. At least two of these will be visits to theatres in London, and the visits will cover a range of different types of international as well as national contemporary performance. Students must expect to pay up to &pound;60 for the cost of theatre tickets, plus around &pound;15 for each return journey to London. In total, including tickets and transport, this module will cost students around &pound;90. Before or after each visit students will undertake relevant research, and write a review of the performance. This process of research and writing will focus the thoughts for the group discussion of the performance in the seminars. Students will then develop a feature idea and pursue it through research and several writing drafts.There will be a strong emphasis in this module on developing writing and verbal skills in order to articulate the experience of live performance through effective theatre criticism. In particular it is aimed to develop students skills in public speaking about performance [in seminar debates and in the professional-standard presentation students will give in class], and their ability to write lucidly and stylishly about performance in theatre reviews and in an independently research article suitable for publication in a good quality broadsheet or theatre journal. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).
