      LZ003 - Sociology for University Study

      
      
       The module will be divided into six main topics of study which are intended to challenge the student to ask questions about their social world and to explore their own individual and cultural experiences within a wider context. In particular, students are encouraged to examine their common-sense assumptions by thinking sociologically. To do this requires not only the development of a sociological imagination but also the use of appropriate methodology and theoretical approaches. This module will introduce these skills to students through a consideration of a number of topics such as:  the sociological imagination; classical sociologists;   the age of modernity/postmodernity; families and intimate relationships; sex/gender and gender relations;  globalisation;  poverty in Britain;  making sense of society. There will be a reading assignment each week. Each teaching session will comprise a lecture by the tutor based on that weeks reading matter. This will be followed by a seminar for questioning, discussing and clarifying of issues raised by the reading matter and the lecture. The lessons learned in these sessions will be developed further through course-assessed and examined essay writing, which play both a formative and a summative role.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LZ004 - Economics - Foundation Year

      
      
       The module will deal with alternative solutions to the problem of resource allocation leading to consideration of the operation of the market mechanism; how the decisions and actions of economic agents are co-ordinated.  Economic systems will be evaluated including treatment of circumstances in which markets are considered to fail.  Market failure will be analysed utilising the micro-economic techniques developed earlier.  In dealing with macro-economic issues such as inflation and unemployment, the UK economy will be used as the primary example, but students will be encouraged to apply their understanding to problems and policies in other economies as well. Likewise, the treatment of international trade will focus on the position of the UK economy with particular emphasis on its place within the European Union and the debate over the adoption of the Single Currency. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      LZ007 - Politics for University Study

      
      
       Through this module, students will be given a broad introduction to the study of politics and international relations with particular emphasis on key debates within the discipline as well as contemporary events. Students will be introduced to the contested nature of politics before moving on to consider how political systems are formed, what major ideas are that drive them as well as the question of how we compare political systems. This will deepen into an examination of political ideologies as well as the role of the state and the nation. Furthermore, students will consider national government functions and how the decision making process works, and how this is being challenged by the process of globalisation. From globalisation, we will move to consider IR as an important aspect of the study of politics, looking at the key theoretical approaches (realism, liberalism) while relating this to contemporary events (war on terror, global economic changes). Students will also spend time studying international history in the twentieth century as an important background to contemporary events as well as a sustained examination of the politics or decolonisation and development. Lastly, the module will draw out some of the ethical questions which arise in international relations and give students an opportunity to debate and discuss them.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

       The module will be divided into two halves; the first term will look at debates within epistemology, philosophy of religion and the philosophy of mind.  The purpose of these is twofold: first to expand students theoretical knowledge across a broad range, and secondly to encourage them to discuss complex ideas in a structured and critical way.  The second term will build upon the skills developed in the first term by exploring contentious issues in moral and political philosophy.
