      FI315 - Introduction to Film Theory

      
      
       This module approaches the big questions that have surrounded film and the moving image and puts them into historical context. Although specific topics will vary, representative topics may address competing definitions of film and its constitutive elements, the effects that cinema has on spectators, the social, cultural and political implications that moving images reproduce, and the status of the medium between art and entertainment. Students will debate seminal writings on the nature of film and bring their arguments to bear on exemplary film productions.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      TH345 - From: Eden To The End of The World: An Introduction to The Bible

      
      
       The Bible is not a single book, but ta biblia, the library. At the most modest estimate, the literatures of the Bible span a period of over eight hundred years.  If we think of the metaphor of a library, the books in the Bible would not just be shelved in the Religion/Theology section, but also, say, Philosophy, Politics and Cultural History/Myth. The influence of these books on Western culture has been immense. This is a course for those seeking basic biblical literacy, which is profoundly useful for studies in other disciplines (e.g. History, or Literature), as well as for students in Religious Studies. It is a course for those who think they already know the Bible (this course will help you read the Bible in different ways, with new questions) and those who have never read a Bible at all. The course gives a basic overview of the story and contexts of the books of the Bible (Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and New Testament) from Genesis to the Apocalypse of John, or from Eden to the End of the World.This course provides a basic introduction to different sections of the biblical library, combining a general overview with in-depth study of selected passages and books. NB: As with all Biblical Studies courses at the University of Kent, Bible is defined in the broadest sense: the Christian and Jewish canons (73 or 66 books, though we wont be studying all of them!) apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, and also all the ancient and modern intertexts, poems, films and novels, that inform and draw on biblical traditions.

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

Students are introduced to a selection of European films as well as to the writings of key Continental filmmakers, theorists and critics. Students will examine the new waves from France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia, and the neo-realism originating in Italy, as well as movements such as Dogme '95. The module also looks at the impact of popular European genre cinema, including analysis of the horror movie and the Spaghetti Western. In addition, the module will also have a contemporary scope, with a study of more recent developments in European film.

      FI594 - Film Authorship

      
      
       This module will offer students the rare opportunity to examine in detail the work of a single director or a group of directors. It will thus enable students to acquire a more complex understanding of the issues at stake in the production, distribution, and reception of a specific body of film work. The module will also develop students knowledge and understanding of the questions, theories and controversies, which have informed critical issues and theoretical debates on film authorship. It will thus appeal to students who wish to extend their skills in analysing film form, meaning, and practice in both a conceptual and a historical context. Furthermore, as the module will enable detailed consideration of what film directing is, as an artistic and cultural practice, in given contexts, it will be a very useful course to combine with the practical study of filmmaking.

      FI599 - The Gothic in Film

      
      
       This module will investigate the Gothic as a significant and recurring cycle within Hollywood film with recognisable tropes and themes, and a dominant tone and style. Beginning with the cycle of Womens Gothic which emerged at the same time as Film Noir, and visually and thematically overlapped with it, the module will explore the particularly filmic ways that such texts manage to evoke the menacing atmosphere and the tone of sexualised danger and suspense achieved by the Gothics source novels and short stories. Continuing from the original cycle of 1940s films, the module will examine later Hollywood films that have employed the themes and imagery of the Gothic to tap into similar complex anxieties and desires, before inspecting films from other cinemas (for example, those of Europe and Asia) which also make use of the dominant Gothic tropes.

      FI603 - Sound and Cinema

      
      
       Cinema has typically been conceived of as an essentially visual phenomenon  films, it is often said, are essentially moving pictures. Sound has, nevertheless, played an important role from the beginnings of cinema, a fact which has been acknowledged in the detailed historical, theoretical and critical work on film music, and film sound more generally, produced over the last decade. Sound and Cinema will provide an overview of this new field of research, and aim to provide students with a clearer understanding of and greater sensitivity to the soundtrack. The course will begin by setting up an introductory framework for the understanding of sound, which considers the relationship between music and other aspects of film sound (dialogue, voice-over, effects), as well as the nature of the relationship between image and sound. Subsequent sessions will consider the evolution of sound technology and its impact on the aural aesthetics of film; the use of classical and popular music in film scores; the emergence of sound designers, such as Walter Murch and Alan Splet, in contemporary cinema; and the distinctive and innovative use of sound and music by such diverse directors as Wim Wenders, Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch, and William Raban.

       The module primarily focuses on contemporary digital filmmaking practices and film viewing. The first section of the module introduces trick cinema, special effects, the digital intermediate, and a range of computer generated images to explore the different opportunities these offer for manipulating space, constructing narratives and aesthetic innovation. The second section of the module more explicitly engages with a range of theoretical frameworks in order to think about how digital technologies alter our understanding of film, its relationships with other media, and the ways in which we participate in film culture.

      FI607 - Storytelling and the Cinema

      
      
       This module examines different forms of narrative and story-telling in cinema, drawing upon theories of myth, folk and fairytale as well as upon anthropological studies of oral storytelling in order to place film narration within the tradition of the popular arts. The psychological and aesthetic role of narrative will be explored through the accounts offered by philosophy and psychoanalysis in order to understand the relations and tensions between narrative realism based on Aristotelian notions of cause and effect as well as character verisimilitude, and popular and avant-garde modes which transgress such notions.  The role played by, for example, film genres and the star system in disrupting or supporting narrative cause and effect will be considered.   The function of the script and of script-writing will be looked at in relation to the deployment of the cinematic elements of sound and image, spectacle and event in film.  The course will be taught through a series of case-studies using a wide range of films within American and world cinema.

      FI565 - British Cinema

      
      
       In a country with a very strong literary and theatrical tradition, the British have also had a long-standing love of "going to the pictures."  For more than a century, British filmmakers have been forging a rich and diverse national cinema in the face of Hollywoods dominance on British screens for most of that time.  This course will offer an introductory historical overview of British cinema from its beginnings to the present day, assessing its role in the construction of British national identity, evaluating its major directorsincluding Humphrey Jennings, Ken Loach and Sally Potter. The films will be approached through multiple frameworks, including consideration of aesthetics (e.g. realism), culture (e.g. gender and class), and history (e.g. the legacy of colonialism).  The institution of cinema and film culture in a larger sense will be considered through the exploration of British film exhibition, criticism, cultural policy, and industry.  Both fiction films and documentaries will be discussed.  

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI611 - New York & The Movies

      
      
       This module examines the way New York has been used as a site for filmmaking, looking at the history of the production of films in and about the city, and as a vital centre of film culture -- not just of filmmaking, but also exhibition and film criticism. Beginning with an examination of film, and modernity, with a specific focus on late silent/early sound film production, the module then shifts to look at avant-garde practice in New York during the 1950s and 60s, and concludes by considering the citys representation in mainstream Hollywood productions with a particular focus on generic crime movies and/or romantic comedies.  The work on New York and film will be contextualised within a cultural history of the city, with a dual emphasis on narratives of immigration and the city as the postwar centre of the world art market.

      FI618 - Screenwriting: An Introduction

      
      
       This module offers students an introduction to the terms, ideas and craft, involved in the creation of screenplays. Screenwriting is a unique form of writing with very different concerns from the novel, theatre and radio. Although the screenplay is a vital component of a films success, it tends to be neglected as a separate art form.In this module we explore the conventions of dramatic structure, new narrative forms and short film variations. Students are encouraged to think critically about screenplay writing and will have an opportunity to write their own screenplay. A selection of writing exercises have been designed to take them through the writing process; from preparation and initial concept to final draft.The emphasis here will be on practical knowledge and support as students uncover their creative voice. This module does not aim to provide vocational training for students wishing to pursue careers in the feature film or television industries.

      FI622 - Television Series: Narration, Engagement and Evaluation

      
      
       The module explores storytelling in fictional television series, and how the long duration of these series changes the spectators engagement, as compared to engagement in the relatively short fiction film. Furthermore, this module focuses on case studies in order to investigate their narrative, stylistic and thematic characteristics, their specific genre conventions and their background in television history. Case studies may include The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Madmen in an inquiry into the narrative as well as moral complexity of this recent, so-called quality trend of American drama television series, and the emerging genre convention of the antihero. The module also addresses how various types of television series have been valued in critical reception through the history of television. For example, in relation to the case studies mentioned above, the module may examine critically the implications of the oft-used label Quality TV and the HBO slogan Its not TV, its HBO. In addition to introducing the students to current developments in television studies, this module takes a film theoretical, narratological approach to current television series, and trains students in various approaches to the study of television series in and beyond television studies proper.

      FI623 - Beyond Cinema

      
      
       From the intimate viewing experience offered by mobile phones to the social interaction required by sing-a-long screenings, this module considers the changing nature of where, when and how audiences engage with film and the moving image. It considers the history of cinema-going, paying attention to the old and new sites of exhibition, especially those facilitated by new technologies. Connectedly, the module analyses the different modes of spectatorship, including audience participation and the desire to prolong or enhance the cinematic experience via extra-filmic activities, such as film-tourism. It also considers films interaction with other arts and mediafor example, its use within theatrical performances and its relationship with television. In doing so, this module reflects upon and reconsiders the definitions and limits of cinema and addresses the implications this has for the academic discipline Film Studies.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

      TH641 - Death and the Afterlife

      
      
       This module will evaluate and critique a range of historical, philosophical, theological and secular perspectives on death and the afterlife, beginning with the way the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, the Quran, the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Upanishads conceptualize the nature and destiny of humankind, including such concepts as sheol, moksha, purgatory, eternal life, heaven and hell. This will be followed by a discussion of the interplay in western theological and philosophical traditions between competing notions of the resurrection of the flesh and the immortality of the body as well as an evaluation of what various Christian thinkers, including Augustine and Origen, believed that an eternity in heaven or hell might be like. The module will then investigate the range of eschatological teachings that different traditions have offered, including in Christian thought the diversity of realized and future forms of eschatology, as well as the tenability of purported testimony surrounding the possibility of out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences and mind-dependent worlds, and the way in which such endeavours have been sustained or critiqued in the light of scientific and historical advances. The module will conclude with a detailed study of the way in which filmmakers and novelists have approached eschatological and apocalyptic teachings and reconceptualised them, with specific reference to Conrad Ostwalts work on the desacralization of the apocalypse in Jewish and Christian thought in a range of 1990s Hollywood science fiction movies, and the impact that such attempts have had on the way questions of life after death have conventionally been approached.

      TH570 - I:Religion and Film

      
      
       The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and evaluate the range of models by which film and religion may be employed as conversation partners and to provide them with the tools necessary for exploring critical links between theology/religious studies and the medium of film. The course will begin with an examination of the methodological, conceptual and disciplinary issues that arise before exploring in critical depth the historical relationship between religion and film, with specific reference to the reception (ranging from prohibition to utilisation) of film by different religious groups.

      TH611 - The Sacred in Contemporary Society

      
      
       The primary aims of this module are to give students a critical grounding in current cultural theories of the sacred, to provide them with opportunities to explore how these concepts relate to contemporary social and cultural phenomena, and to reflect on how this process might help us to refine cultural theories of the sacred. The module will enable students to distinguish between ontological and cultural theories of the sacred, and will introduce them to key cultural theorists of the sacred such as Durkheim, Shils, Bellah, and Alexander. A range of cases will also be explored to provide students with opportunities to think about how relevant concepts might relate to specific social and cultural phenomena, and to provide a basis for the analytical work they undertake in their assessed essay.  An illustrative list of sessions would be:a. ontological and cultural theories of the sacredb. the sacred and cultural sociologyc. The influence of Durkheim's theory of the sacredd. Edward Shils: the place of the sacred in modern societye. Robert Bellah: the case of American civil religionf. Jeffrey Alexander: performing the sacred in the modern worldg.

      TH638 - Global Christianities

      
      
       This module will examine the theme Global Christianities through the lenses of the anthropology of Christianity and the sociology of religion. We will explore the ways in which we can see Christianity as a cultural product, and how Christianity has shaped different cultures and societies globally, as well as how the religion has been shaped by and through encounters in different local settings. We will look at the history of the globalization of Christianity, and consider the historical, political and economic effects of local missionary encounters. The course will examine the processes of conversion to Christianity in different contexts, both at the level of individual and broader social group, and how these have been understood in relation to concepts of modernity. The course will draw attention to the relatively recent emergence of the anthropology of Christianity in relation to the broader disciplines of anthropology as a discrete area of study and how this relates to the study of Christianity as a global phenomenon within sociology. We will consider the ways in which these disciplines have constructed and objectified religion as an object of study in ways that has historically occluded the social scientific study of Christianity in different global contexts. The course will address some of the main debates in the anthropology of Christianity, deepening understanding of global Christianities through exploring studies of Christian cultures in diverse ethnographic contexts. The topics addressed will include: culture and conversion; globalization and localization; interrelations between Christianity, subjectivity and language; embodied and emotional forms of different Christianities; concepts and experiences of God; mediation, immanence and transcendence; coherence and fragmentation; gender, sexuality and the family. Through engaging with readings on these areas, we will explore the socio-religious power-dynamics of Christianity in relation to both culturally dominant and marginal traditions.

      TH628 - Gods and Government from the Roman Empire to Tony Blair

      
      
       Recent cultural and political theories have been haunted by the question of religion, its definitions and functions, its emancipatory capacities, its relation to violence, and its relationship to the history and future of the concept of the secular.  The centrality of religion as a topic for these recent interdisciplinary discussions has emerged in relationship to a growing unease about earlier, modern modes of distinguishing public and private life; a return of religion as an internationally significant political force in recent decades; and surprising appropriations of religion as a figure for secular Western democracy. Theorists (particularly in the area of postcolonial theory) are questioning naturalized or ahistorical distinctions between religion and the secular (e.g., Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Saba Mahmood). Many contemporary thinkers attempt to short-circuit the distinction between religion and politics, making possible surprising paradoxes of a materialist theology (Slavoj iek), an emptied religiosity (Gianni Vattimo), or what Hent de Vries calls simply a political theology. Once we get down beneath the easily-rehearsed stereotypes, we find that the old religious archives (like the Bible) model competing forms of politics: from messianic anarchism to theocracy. In our political historiesand presentsthese have been used (and now are being re-used) in surprising ways.This course considers important moments in the Western history of political theology in order to understand modern and contemporary discussions of secular politics.  These moments will be considered in relation to comparable instances of politically imagined theology (or theologically imagined politics) from other religious traditions as well. Students will:- examine key topics in the modern formation of these discussions (e.g., distinctions between public and private; secular spheres; religion as extra-political ideal; fanaticism; politicized evaluations of Western religion as exceptional in relation to the others; religion and political revolution)- map important similarities and differences between Western and non-Western modelling of the relationship between religion and politics- critically evaluate recent presentations of the inherent violence of religions, the inevitability of the clash of civilizations, and the usefulness of religion in making globalization work

       The aim of the course is to provide an understanding of the interrelations between religion, modernity, capitalism and ideology. We will examine classic debates in social theory in relation to Western culture and capitalism, and bring them up to date in relation to contemporary sociological theory and political theology, applying these to examples from Europe, North and Latin America, and Africa. The course will primarily relate to the history of and contemporary Christianity and the birth of economics, although students will also have the opportunity to explore these questions in relation to other religions through their own independent research. It will critically explore both left- and right-wing theological models, and seek to deepen understanding of the relationship between religious and spiritual movements and capitalist economics. The course will prominent debates in the relations between religion, capitalism and economics including: Natural Theology and Political Economy; Karl Marx and the Judeo-Christian Tradition; Max Weber and the Protestant Work Ethic; the Social Gospel and Christian Socialism; Colonialism, Christianity and Capitalist Modernities; Neoliberalism and Christianity; Liberation Theologies; and Capitalist Spiritualities.

      TH622 - Cracking Biblical Codes: Prophecy, Apocalyptic and Wisdom

      
      
       This module will explore the theme of Biblical Codes from two angles:1) How has the Bible been read as code?2) How can we read/ decode biblical mysteries (prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom) Under heading 1) we will be exploring how different writers and groups (some of them inside the Bible, some of them outside it) have read the Bible as temporal or political code. For example, the biblical book of Daniel attempts to decode the book of Jeremiah, which had already become deeply mysterious to ancient readers. Similarly, the New Testament deciphers biblical prophecy and motifs by applying them to Jesus or the Roman Empire. At the other end of the time spectrum, we find bestsellers like Michael Drosnins The Bible Code (1997), Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHayes attempts to decrypt biblical visions of the end of time by way of contemporary global politics, or recent readings of the book of Ezekiel as prophecies about UFOs. Techniques of decryption are also built into central developments within Jewish and Christian traditions. In fact, what is often called the history of hermeneutics could also be described as the history of How not to read literally. We will be looking at a range of examples of such developments by focusing on readers like Philo of Alexandria, Augustine of Hippo, or Jewish Kabbalah. Under heading 2, we will undertake some in-depth readings of prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom textsthe ones that readers of the Bible find most difficult to decode. Texts to be studied will be taken from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Pseudepigrapha. We will be exploring the contexts that produced these literatures and thinking about how to read (decipher?) them across the abyss of time.

      ART502 - Costume and Fashion

      
      
       The art historian Aby Warburg  an avid reader of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical novel about clothes Sartor Resartus (1836)  said that a good costume, like a good symbol, should conceal as much as it reveals. This module will take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of costume and fashion  the art that can be worn  in order to explore their roles in drama, film and the visual arts. The social values encoded by clothes, their relation to class or sexual identity, will be discussed, along with how these assumptions inform the use of costume in adaptations or stagings of texts, or how they colour our view of a character, or of a directors interpretation (for example, using deliberate anachronism). The role of clothing and costume in the history of art will be analysed from artists representation of clothes, contemporary or otherwise, to their involvement in fashion design. The module will also engage in depth with the history of fashion, studying classic designers like Coco Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent and also innovative contemporary designers like Alexander McQueen and Hussain Chalayan; exploring the cultural history of important periods in fashion such as the 1920s and 1960s; analysing the 'haute couture system alongside popular sub-cultures like Mod and Punk; and examining leading fashion photographers like Horst, Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.

       From the intimate viewing experience offered by mobile phones to the social interaction required by sing-a-long screenings, this module considers the changing nature of where, when and how audiences engage with film and the moving image. It considers the history of cinema-going, paying attention to the old and new sites of exhibition, especially those facilitated by new technologies. Connectedly, the module analyses the different modes of spectatorship, including audience participation and the desire to prolong or enhance the cinematic experience via extra-filmic activities, such as film-tourism. It also considers films interaction with other arts and mediafor example, its use within theatrical performances and its relationship with television. In doing so, this module reflects upon and reconsiders the definitions and limits of cinema and addresses the implications this has for the academic discipline Film Studies.

      FI622 - Television Series: Narration, Engagement and Evaluation

      
      
       The module explores storytelling in fictional television series, and how the long duration of these series changes the spectators engagement, as compared to engagement in the relatively short fiction film. Furthermore, this module focuses on case studies in order to investigate their narrative, stylistic and thematic characteristics, their specific genre conventions and their background in television history. Case studies may include The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad and Madmen in an inquiry into the narrative as well as moral complexity of this recent, so-called quality trend of American drama television series, and the emerging genre convention of the antihero. The module also addresses how various types of television series have been valued in critical reception through the history of television. For example, in relation to the case studies mentioned above, the module may examine critically the implications of the oft-used label Quality TV and the HBO slogan Its not TV, its HBO. In addition to introducing the students to current developments in television studies, this module takes a film theoretical, narratological approach to current television series, and trains students in various approaches to the study of television series in and beyond television studies proper.

       This module examines the way New York has been used as a site for filmmaking, looking at the history of the production of films in and about the city, and as a vital centre of film culture -- not just of filmmaking, but also exhibition and film criticism. Beginning with an examination of film, and modernity, with a specific focus on late silent/early sound film production, the module then shifts to look at avant-garde practice in New York during the 1950s and 60s, and concludes by considering the citys representation in mainstream Hollywood productions with a particular focus on generic crime movies and/or romantic comedies.The work on New York and film will be contextualised within a cultural history of the city, with a dual emphasis on narratives of immigration and the city as the postwar centre of the world art market.

      FI584 - The Gothic in Film

      
      
       This module will investigate the Gothic as a significant and recurring cycle within Hollywood film with recognisable tropes and themes, and a dominant tone and style. Beginning with the cycle of Womens Gothic which emerged at the same time as Film Noir, and visually and thematically overlapped with it, the module will explore the particularly filmic ways that such texts manage to evoke the menacing atmosphere and the tone of sexualised danger and suspense achieved by the Gothics source novels and short stories. Continuing from the original cycle of 1940s films, the module will examine later Hollywood films that have employed the themes and imagery of the Gothic to tap into similar complex anxieties and desires, before inspecting films from other cinemas (for example, those of Europe and Asia) which also make use of the dominant Gothic tropes.

      FI608 - Film Authorship

      
      
       This module will offer students the rare opportunity to examine in detail the work of a single director or a group of directors. It will thus enable students to acquire a more complex understanding of the issues at stake in the production, distribution, and reception of a specific body of film work. The module will also develop students knowledge and understanding of the questions, theories and controversies, which have informed critical issues and theoretical debates on film authorship. It will thus appeal to students who wish to extend their skills in analysing film form, meaning, and practice in both a conceptual and a historical context. Furthermore, as the module will enable detailed consideration of what film directing is, as an artistic and cultural practice, in given contexts, it will be a very useful course to combine with the practical study of filmmaking.

      FI555 - Screenwriting: An Introduction

      
      
       This module offers students an introduction to the terms, ideas and craft, involved in the creation of screenplays.  Screenwriting is a unique form of writing with very different concerns from the novel, theatre and radio. Although the screenplay is a vital component of a films success, it tends to be neglected as a separate art form.In this module we explore the conventions of dramatic structure, new narrative forms and short film variations.  Students are  encouraged to think critically about screenplay writing and will have an opportunity to write their own screenplay.  A selection of writing exercises have been designed to take them through the writing process; from preparation and initial concept to final draft.The emphasis here will be on practical knowledge and support as students uncover their creative voice. This module does not aim to provide vocational training for students wishing to pursue careers in the feature film or television industries. 

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      FI559 - Sound and Cinema

      
      
       Cinema has typically been conceived of as an essentially visual phenomenon  films, it is often said, are essentially moving pictures. Sound has, nevertheless, played an important role from the beginnings of cinema, a fact which has been acknowledged in the detailed historical, theoretical and critical work on film music, and film sound more generally, produced over the last decade. Sound and Cinema will provide an overview of this new field of research, and aim to provide students with a clearer understanding of and greater sensitivity to the soundtrack. The course will begin by setting up an introductory framework for the understanding of sound, which considers the relationship between music and other aspects of film sound (dialogue, voice-over, effects), as well as the nature of the relationship between image and sound. Subsequent sessions will consider the evolution of sound technology and its impact on the aural aesthetics of film; the use of classical and popular music in film scores; the emergence of sound designers, such as Walter Murch and Alan Splet, in contemporary cinema; and the distinctive and innovative use of sound and music by such diverse directors as Wim Wenders, Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch, and William Raban.

      FI501 - Documentary Cinema

      
      
       This module addresses a series of documentary films in their historical context and in relation to the different modes of non-fiction filmmaking. Documentary narrative techniques including the use of archival footage, staged reconstructions of past events, and talking-head interviews, are investigated by means of close textual analysis and through a comparative approach to diverse documentary films. This module also explores the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction and, while articulating a definition of documentary film, it studies film forms that present an interplay between the two, such as Mockumentaries and Essay Films.

      FI527 - Storytelling and the Cinema

      
      
       This module examines different forms of narrative and story-telling in cinema, drawing upon theories of myth, folk and fairytale as well as upon anthropological studies of oral storytelling in order to place film narration within the tradition of the popular arts. The psychological and aesthetic role of narrative will be explored through the accounts offered by philosophy and psychoanalysis in order to understand the relations and tensions between narrative realism based on Aristotelian notions of cause and effect as well as character verisimilitude, and popular and avant-garde modes which transgress such notions.  The role played by, for example, film genres and the star system in disrupting or supporting narrative cause and effect will be considered.   The function of the script and of script-writing will be looked at in relation to the deployment of the cinematic elements of sound and image, spectacle and event in film.  The course will be taught through a series of case-studies using a wide range of films within American and world cinema.

      TH623 - Cracking Biblical Codes: Prophecy, Apocalyptic and Wisdom

      
      
       This module will explore the theme of Biblical Codes from two angles:1) How has the Bible been read as code?2) How can we read/ decode biblical mysteries (prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom) Under heading 1) we will be exploring how different writers and groups (some of them inside the Bible, some of them outside it) have read the Bible as temporal or political code. For example, the biblical book of Daniel attempts to decode the book of Jeremiah, which had already become deeply mysterious to ancient readers. Similarly, the New Testament deciphers biblical prophecy and motifs by applying them to Jesus or the Roman Empire. At the other end of the time spectrum, we find bestsellers like Michael Drosnins The Bible Code (1997), Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHayes attempts to decrypt biblical visions of the end of time by way of contemporary global politics, or recent readings of the book of Ezekiel as prophecies about UFOs. Techniques of decryption are also built into central developments within Jewish and Christian traditions. In fact, what is often called the history of hermeneutics could also be described as the history of How not to read literally. We will be looking at a range of examples of such developments by focusing on readers like Philo of Alexandria, Augustine of Hippo, or Jewish Kabbalah. Under heading 2, we will undertake some in-depth readings of prophecy, apocalyptic, or wisdom textsthe ones that readers of the Bible find most difficult to decode. Texts to be studied will be taken from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Pseudepigrapha. We will be exploring the contexts that produced these literatures and thinking about how to read (decipher?) them across the abyss of time.

      TH627 - Gods and Government from the Roman Empire to Tony Blair

      
      
       Recent cultural and political theories have been haunted by the question of religion, its definitions and functions, its emancipatory capacities, its relation to violence, and its relationship to the history and future of the concept of the secular.  The centrality of religion as a topic for these recent interdisciplinary discussions has emerged in relationship to a growing unease about earlier, modern modes of distinguishing public and private life; a return of religion as an internationally significant political force in recent decades; and surprising appropriations of religion as a figure for secular Western democracy. Theorists (particularly in the area of postcolonial theory) are questioning naturalized or ahistorical distinctions between religion and the secular (e.g., Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Saba Mahmood). Many contemporary thinkers attempt to short-circuit the distinction between religion and politics, making possible surprising paradoxes of a materialist theology (Slavoj iek), an emptied religiosity (Gianni Vattimo), or what Hent de Vries calls simply a political theology. Once we get down beneath the easily-rehearsed stereotypes, we find that the old religious archives (like the Bible) model competing forms of politics: from messianic anarchism to theocracy. In our political historiesand presentsthese have been used (and now are being re-used) in surprising ways.This course considers important moments in the Western history of political theology in order to understand modern and contemporary discussions of secular politics.  These moments will be considered in relation to comparable instances of politically imagined theology (or theologically imagined politics) from other religious traditions as well. Students will:- examine key topics in the modern formation of these discussions (e.g., distinctions between public and private; secular spheres; religion as extra-political ideal; fanaticism; politicized evaluations of Western religion as exceptional in relation to the others; religion and political revolution)- map important similarities and differences between Western and non-Western modelling of the relationship between religion and politics- critically evaluate recent presentations of the inherent violence of religions, the inevitability of the clash of civilizations, and the usefulness of religion in making globalization work

       The aim of the course is to provide an understanding of the interrelations between religion, modernity, capitalism and ideology. We will examine classic debates in social theory in relation to Western culture and capitalism, and bring them up to date in relation to contemporary sociological theory and political theology, applying these to examples from Europe, North and Latin America, and Africa. The course will primarily relate to the history of and contemporary Christianity and the birth of economics, although students will also have the opportunity to explore these questions in relation to other religions through their own independent research. It will critically explore both left- and right-wing theological models, and seek to deepen understanding of the relationship between religious and spiritual movements and capitalist economics. The course will prominent debates in the relations between religion, capitalism and economics including: Natural Theology and Political Economy; Karl Marx and the Judeo-Christian Tradition; Max Weber and the Protestant Work Ethic; the Social Gospel and Christian Socialism; Colonialism, Christianity and Capitalist Modernities; Neoliberalism and Christianity; Liberation Theologies; and Capitalist Spiritualities.

      TH639 - Global Christianities

      
      
       This module will examine the theme Global Christianities through the lenses of the anthropology of Christianity and the sociology of religion. We will explore the ways in which we can see Christianity as a cultural product, and how Christianity has shaped different cultures and societies globally, as well as how the religion has been shaped by and through encounters in different local settings. We will look at the history of the globalization of Christianity, and consider the historical, political and economic effects of local missionary encounters. The course will examine the processes of conversion to Christianity in different contexts, both at the level of individual and broader social group, and how these have been understood in relation to concepts of modernity. The course will draw attention to the relatively recent emergence of the anthropology of Christianity in relation to the broader disciplines of anthropology as a discrete area of study and how this relates to the study of Christianity as a global phenomenon within sociology. We will consider the ways in which these disciplines have constructed and objectified religion as an object of study in ways that has historically occluded the social scientific study of Christianity in different global contexts. The course will address some of the main debates in the anthropology of Christianity, deepening understanding of global Christianities through exploring studies of Christian cultures in diverse ethnographic contexts. The topics addressed will include: culture and conversion; globalization and localization; interrelations between Christianity, subjectivity and language; embodied and emotional forms of different Christianities; concepts and experiences of God; mediation, immanence and transcendence; coherence and fragmentation; gender, sexuality and the family. Through engaging with readings on these areas, we will explore the socio-religious power-dynamics of Christianity in relation to both culturally dominant and marginal traditions.

      TH612 - The Sacred in Contemporary Society

      
      
       The primary aims of this module are to give students a critical grounding in current cultural theories of the sacred, to provide them with opportunities to explore how these concepts relate to contemporary social and cultural phenomena, and to reflect on how this process might help us to refine cultural theories of the sacred. The module will enable students to distinguish between ontological and cultural theories of the sacred, and will introduce them to key cultural theorists of the sacred such as Durkheim, Shils, Bellah, and Alexander. A range of cases will also be explored to provide students with opportunities to think about how relevant concepts might relate to specific social and cultural phenomena, and to provide a basis for the analytical work they undertake in their assessed essay. An illustrative list of sessions would be:a. ontological and cultural theories of the sacredb. the sacred and cultural sociologyc. The influence of Durkheim's theory of the sacredd. Edward Shils: the place of the sacred in modern societye. Robert Bellah: the case of American civil religionf. Jeffrey Alexander: performing the sacred in the modern worldg.

       The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and evaluate the range of models by which film and religion may be employed as conversation partners and to provide them with the tools necessary for exploring critical links between theology/religious studies and the medium of film. The course will begin with an examination of the methodological, conceptual and disciplinary issues that arise before exploring in critical depth the historical relationship between religion and film, with specific reference to the reception (ranging from prohibition to utilisation) of film by different religious groups. There will be a focus on particular categories of film and categories and models of religious and theological understanding, allowing students taking this module to develop the critical skills helpful for film interpretation and for exploring possible religious and theological approaches to film criticism.Film clips will be used within lectures and will be discussed and unpacked in the seminars.

      TH642 - Death and the Afterlife

      
      
       This module will evaluate and critique a range of historical, philosophical, theological and secular perspectives on death and the afterlife, beginning with the way the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, the Quran, the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Upanishads conceptualize the nature and destiny of humankind, including such concepts as sheol, moksha, purgatory, eternal life, heaven and hell. This will be followed by a discussion of the interplay in western theological and philosophical traditions between competing notions of the resurrection of the flesh and the immortality of the body as well as an evaluation of what various Christian thinkers, including Augustine and Origen, believed that an eternity in heaven or hell might be like. The module will then investigate the range of eschatological teachings that different traditions have offered, including in Christian thought the diversity of realized and future forms of eschatology, as well as the tenability of purported testimony surrounding the possibility of out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences and mind-dependent worlds, and the way in which such endeavours have been sustained or critiqued in the light of scientific and historical advances. The module will conclude with a detailed study of the way in which filmmakers and novelists have approached eschatological and apocalyptic teachings and reconceptualised them, with specific reference to Conrad Ostwalts work on the desacralization of the apocalypse in Jewish and Christian thought in a range of 1990s Hollywood science fiction movies, and the impact that such attempts have had on the way questions of life after death have conventionally been approached.

       The main emphasis of the course is on identifying and evaluating the competing soteriological perspectives and paths to spiritual emancipation which have shaped the development of the Hindu religious tradition. Among the themes discussed are: the relationship between mysticism and philosophy, mythology, magic and devotion; gnosis, action and devotion as paths to salvation; ontology and cosmology; cartographies of states of consciousness; theism, panentheism and non-dualism; types of contemplative practice; the role of the body in spiritual life; asceticism and pleasure as vehicles for spiritual liberation; the role of the guru and the nature of spiritual transmission. These themes will be approached through the study of Hindu texts in translation, but attention will also be given to some Sanskrit terminology.

      TH558 - Sociology of Religion

      
      
       The aim of this module is to enable students to think sociologically about religious life. Whilst addressing key debates within the sociology of religion (e.g. secularization, subjectivization), it seeks to introduce students to core concepts and methods in sociology that will enable them to understand religious life in terms of broader social structures and processes.  Examples of issues covered in the module include: the nature of sociology as a discipline, macro and micro levels of analysis, the agency/structure debate and the nature of social structure, individualization, and sociological perspectives on gender, class, emotion, materiality and belief. The significance of intersectionality between different social structures will also be discussed, and useful sources of secondary data (e.g. BRIN) will be explored. The central assessment task for the module  a case study presenting the sociological analysis of the nature and place of religion in a particular individuals life  brings these theoretical and methodological approaches together into a micro-level analysis of lived religion in a way that is informed by broader social and cultural structures. Examples of good writing in this style of sociological research are presented and explored through the module.

      TH515 - Theology and Religious Studies Dissertation

      
      
       Students are required to identify a viable research focus or question for their project which they will then pursue, with supervisory support, in order to submit their final dissertation. In the summer before joining the module, students will be given advice on how to identify their research focus, and by the start of the autumn term in which the module begins they will be expected to have produced a single side of A4 summarising key literature or other sources relevant to their specific project. Individual supervision will begin from the autumn term onwards. Initially this is likely to focus on clarifying the research focus or question, and situating it more deeply in existing literature and debates. Following this a clearer outline plan for conducting the research will be developed, with students then undertaking work necessary to meet each phase of this plan. If the project involves original fieldwork, the student will be expected to submit a research ethics application form for Faculty approval. As the project develops, chapter drafts will be submitted for review and discussion with the supervisor. Supervision contact time is likely to vary according to the project and student need, but will not exceed a total of 6 hours per student (including face to face supervision or time spent writing written feedback to electronically-submitted drafts). Supervisors will provide feedback on chapter drafts, which will need to be submitted to supervisors in good time before supervision meetings, but will not provide feedback on whole draft manuscripts once chapters are completed.Supervisors will only provide supervisory support during term-time. Once the project has been agreed and a supervisor allocated in the autumn term, students will not normally be allowed to change their fundamental focus of their project (although their specific questions are likely to change as the project develops) or change their supervisor unless in highly exceptional circumstances.
