This module covers the development of simple software systems. Students will gain an understanding of the software development process, and learn to design and implement applications in a popular object-oriented programming language.  Fundamentals of classes and objects are introduced, and key features of class descriptions:   constructors, methods and fields.  Method implementation through assignment, selection control structures, iterative control structures and other statements is introduced.  Collection objects are also covered and the availability of library classes as building blocks.  Throughout the course, the quality of class design and the need for a professional approach to software development is emphasized

       The project gives you the opportunity to follow and develop your particular technical interests, undertake a larger and less tightly specified piece of work than you have before (at university), and develop the project organisation, implementation and documentation techniques which you have learnt in other modules. The technical and professional aspects of project courses are seen as particularly important by both employers (who will often bring them up in interviews) and by professional bodies.The project may be self-proposed or may be selected from a list of project proposals. Typically, a project will involve the specification, design, implementation, documentation and demonstration of a technical artefact. The project is supervised by a member of the academic staff, who holds weekly meetings with the group, during which s/he will give general advice and will assess the progress of the group and the contributions by individual students. Project deliverables are:- a technical report, in the style of an academic paper, describing the scientific/technical outcome of the project; - a well-indexed corpus of material that supports the achievements claimed. In addition, each individual prepares a report outlining his/her contributions to each of the various aspects of the project. This report should not be a repeat of other material delivered as part of the project, but an assessment of the progress of the project and reflections on what the individual has learnt from undertaking it. In particular, it should include a description of the particular activities and outcomes that individual has contributed to the project, and of how the group worked together. This report will be discussed at a viva voce examination which should include a short presentation/demonstration of the project.

      EL561 - Image Analysis & Applications

      
      
       Intelligent processing is associated with information processing operations which are generally carried out reliably and efficiently by humans, but which may be much more challenging for computer-based processing systems.  This module will introduce and explore some important techniques and applications for automated intelligent processing.  Principally, it will explore the visual environment, which is so important in human activity and increasingly so in supporting computational processing platforms routinely encountered in the modern world.  The display, manipulation and efficient communication of images (embracing issues ranging from how to manipulate image data to provide an optimal visual experience, to the automatic extraction of information from images to understand their content) are key elements in the design and utilisation of many contemporary applications in digital media and in engineering.This module will introduce the basic techniques required for image processing and automated image analysis, and will include a introductory study of the use of so-called neural network processors for the analysis of images, especially in relation to problems of image recognition, since such architectures neatly bridge the areas of human and automated processing.  Similarly, the module will embrace important topics of increasing interest in the context of maintaining the security of systems and media, including particularly an introduction to the emerging field of biometrics (the automatic identification of individuals).  Biometrics provides a good domain within which the power of intelligent processing can be illustrated, both because the identification of individuals is a fundamental human capability, and is increasingly important in many media applications (especially in relation to system security), but also because this often relies directly on the effective processing of visual data and complex images.
