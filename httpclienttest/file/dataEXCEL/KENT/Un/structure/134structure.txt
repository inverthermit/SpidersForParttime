  Stage 3

   
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      PH603 - Physics Group Project

      
      
       The introductory workshops cover the general objectives of the module and a presentation of the specific topics available in the current year (students are explicitly encouraged to offer alternate topics provided they are able to secure the agreement of the module convenor).  Additional workshops provide opportunities to discuss and share ideas, and to introduce what is needed within a successful presentation (the presentations are filmed, and the resulting DVD used for detailed feedback and for other purposes provided that the informed written consent of all group members is forthcoming).  There is a distinct role play element to the conduct of the module.  Students may be given the opportunity to define their own groupings provided that there is overall agreement within the peer group, but the convenor will retain the right to define both the overall parameters (e.g. the number of students to be in each group) and the final assignment of students into groups if that proves to be necessary.  Students then make a choice of topic and elect their group project manager.  The groups arrange their own regular meetings, which will be minuted; the supervisor may be present at these sessions.  The group will produce a word-processed report on the work undertaken; it will also present the work in appropriate public forms (a poster and a talk).  The report will include a statement on the groups project methodology, presented in the context of their initial draft work plan and tasks assignment, as well as a statement describing the individual contributions to the groups aims and objectives.The project themes vary widely depending on student preferences/interests, but for example could fall in one of the following general categories:o linked specifically to the goals of a suitable industrial partner;o off-campus interactions, such as working with a school physics group or small business in the local area;o the production of an instruction booklet, teaching aid or video aimed at a pre-define audience;o a design project for a piece of instrumentation or a computational code;o a survey or analysis of a physics-centred contemporary issue of scientific, social, political or ethical interest or concern;o the input of physics to interdisciplinary issues such as those associated with environmental or conservation science.
