 Stage 1

  
Possible modules may include: 


                    
      CL329 - Introduction to Archaeology

      
      
       The module will introduce archaeology as an academic discipline, providing grounding in basic concepts and methodology and techniques of analysis relating to archaeological evidence. It will provide background relevant to other archaeological and historical modules through examining aspects of the archaeological process in prehistoric, Roman and medieval contexts. It will enable students to make an informed choice of subsequent modules. Topics will include basic fieldwork methods and techniques, and an introduction to key topics in interpretation, such as society and culture, ritual and religion, technology, etc. through case studies e.g . of Pompeii, Sutton Hoo, and the Ice Man.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 15 credits (7.5 ECTS credits).

      CL353 - The Civilisations of Greece and Rome

      
      
       In the Autumn term we start with Greece. The history will centre on Athens in the 5th century B.C. We begin with Solons reforms, then after considering the period of the Persian invasions we study the developed democracy with its empire under Pericles and its destruction in the Peloponnesian War. After 5 weeks, we move to the literature of the period, more specifically, the development of tragedy and comedy in fifth-century Athens, examining staging and dramatic conventions such as the role of actor, chorus and religious function and plot, especially the handling of mythological themes. We will analyse a selection of major plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. Within this framework the module explores the role of tragedy and comedy as vehicles for public debate in the democracy, and its treatment of justice, religion, rationalism and patriotic themes.In the Spring term, we move to Rome. In the Roman part of the course we shall treat the last century of the republic. Our focus will be on how that republic fell and was replaced by the empire whose founder was Augustus. Among the themes examined will be political violence, the intrusion of the army into political life and the rise of the warlord. In the literature part of the Spring term the module is concerned with the patronage of the arts (poetry, history writing, art and architecture) under Augustus, with the role of the arts as propaganda, and the thesis that writers were recruited to act as spokesmen for the policies and ideals of the principate. The central theme is the creation of enduring images of Rome and Empire, using traditional historical and mythological materials; alongside this the module treats areas of public policy such as moral legislation, festivals, religious reform and the position of women.  The module is also concerned with the responses of the writers, whether as supporters of public policy, or as commenting on and reacting against it. Thus, its content is much better understood as a result of the historical development outlined in the first part of term.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      EN333 - Romanticism

      
      
       This year-long course examines some of the most significant writing of the Romantic period (1780-1830) - a period in which the role and forms of literature were being redefined - alongside recent debates in critical theory. You will study a wide range of literary texts from the poetry of Blake, Wordsworth and Keats to the novels of Jane Austen and Mary Shelley, with reference to contemporary literary and political debates and against the backdrop of the periods turbulent history. In parallel, this module explores fundamental critical questions about literature: Why read it? What is an author? What is the role of poetry in society? How is literature shaped by culture? What is Art? Continuities and disjunctions between Romantic writers answers to these questions and those provided by more recent literary theorists will be a central concern of the course.

      EN331 - Readings in the Twentieth Century

      
      
       This module emphasizes the links between literature, history, and culture. It introduces students to the formative events, debates and struggles of the twentieth century, and how these have been addressed by different modes of creative and critical writing. Topics such as the First World War, Modernism, the Holocaust, the US culture industry, postcolonial studies, as well as 9/11, will be considered and discussed in relation to fictional and critical literature, films, photography, graphic novels, music, and other media. Weekly screenings will run alongside lectures and seminar discussions. Literary works across all genres will be read in relation to visual material  such as paintings, photography, various feature and documentary films, etc  and a range of selected critical reading. The majority of writing samples are drawn from English, American and more broadly anglophone writing, though several instances of writing in other languages will also be included (all taught in translation).

      EN332 - Writing America

      
      
       This module aims to emphasize connections between literature and culture in the USA, from early considerations of a distinct American literature to the present day. By way of six key themes or preoccupations, the module will introduce students to some of the major debates and antagonisms, and rhetorical and stylistic modes, that have formed and modified American literary and intellectual culture Questions of Belief, Gender, Race, Economy, Space, and Time will be approached through a range of textual forms set against their historical contexts and within the broader nexus of cultural production including the visual performing arts where appropriate. Students will be encouraged to examine the specific local, regional, and national frameworks within which these texts are produced, but also to look at the ways in which they resist and transcend national boundaries, in the development of an American register in world literatures for instance.

      EN302 - Early Drama

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of medieval and early modern dramatic genres, from ninth-century Latin church drama to the commercial theatres of Shakespeare's London. Students will learn about methods for analysing past performances and existing texts, as well as how drama interacted with and responded to pivotal moments in British history, and the culture, politics and religion of the period.  As such, the module will function as an introduction to medieval and early modern studies more broadly and a platform from which to undertake early English literature and drama modules, such as Chaucer and Late Medieval Literature, Early Modern Literature, 1500-1700 and Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama, at Stages 2 and 3.  Students will read and discuss playtexts in modern translations, both as literary objects and live performance events. Regular optional site visits and screenings will contribute to students understanding of the dramas contexts, how plays might work in performance and to what extent they still speak to twenty-first century audiences. Lectures and seminars are designed to be varied and interactive, with the opportunity for everyone to participate and to develop key academic skills. The module is assessed by seminar contributions, creative and research-based coursework and a final end-of-year project, which will allow students the freedom to explore a topic of their choice creatively.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

Possible modules may include: 


                     
      EN681 - Novelty, Enlightenment and Emancipation: 18th Century Literature

      
      
       Before 1660 there was no English novel, and by the end of the eighteenth century there was Jane Austen. This module asks how such a literary revolution was possible. It investigates the rise of professional authorship in an increasingly open marketplace for books. With commercial expansion came experiment and novelty. Genres unheard of in the Renaissance emerged for the first time: they include the periodical essay, autobiography, the oriental tale, amatory fiction, slave narratives and, most remarkably, the modern novel. Ancient modes such as satire, pastoral and romance underwent surprising transformations. Many eighteenth-century men and women felt that they lived in an age of reason and emancipation  although others warned of enlightenments darker aspect. Seminar reading reflects the fact that an increasing number of women, members of the labouring classes, and African slaves wrote for publication; that readers themselves became more socially varied; and that Britain was growing to understand itself as an imperial nation within a shifting global context. It asks students to reflect, as eighteenth-century writers did, upon the literary, cultural and political implications of these developments

      EN692 - Early Modern Literature 1500-1700

      
      
       This module offers a survey of early modern literature from 1500 to 1700. Looking at a wide range of literature including poetry, prose and drama, students will consider the relationship between literary debate and form on the one hand, and political change, social identity and religious transformation on the other. We will consider how important debates surrounding political, social, gender and religious identity inflect and are reflected in the literature of the period, including works by Baldwin, Donne, Lanyer, Marvell, Milton and Behn. Students will also explore the boundaries of the literary canon, encountering pamphlets, sermons and conduct books, and consider the ways in which literary and non-literary texts both mirror and influence culture and society.

      EN694 - Shakespeare and Early Modern Drama

      
      
       The drama of early modern England broke new literary and dramatic ground. This module will focus on key plays across the period, exploring the development of dramatic writing, playing companies home within the London theatres, dramas links to court entertainment and its relationship to the provinces. Dramatic and literary form will be a central preoccupation alongside issues of characterisation, culture, politics and gender. Shakespeares work will be put into context in relation to the plays of contemporary dramatists as well as the various cultural, historical and material circumstances that influenced the composition, performance and publication of drama in early modern England.

      EN697 - Chaucer and Late Medieval English Literature

      
      
       This module will introduce students to a range of writing from the late medieval period.  It will focus on a number of central genres in English literature that emerge between the late fourteenth and early sixteenth centuries (from romance, tragedy and fabliaux through to morality plays and devotional prose) and will explore some key topics and themes in medieval literature, such as authority, gender, sexuality, piety, chivalric identity, narrative and voice, truth and destiny.  Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales will offer an accessible introduction to these core genres and themes, and initiate students in issues that are pertinent to less familiar writers and texts from the period, such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Malorys Le Morte Darthur, and The Book of Margery Kempe.  During the course of the module you will also learn about the historical and cultural contexts of the fourteenth, fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and how such contexts influenced the literature of the period.The themes and theories covered by the course will vary in response to the lecture programme and the emphasis and research specialisms of individual teachers.  Previous topics have included: gender and sexuality; authorship and patronage; history of the book; manuscripts and the printed texts; piety and devotion; iconography; social relations; performance cultures; audience, reading and reception; the body, corporeality and experience.

      EN695 - Empire, New Nations and Migration

      
      
       This course will introduce students to the field of postcolonial literature, focusing on the period from the late nineteenth century to the present day. The course will be divided into three consecutive areas: empire and colonisation; the processes of decolonisation; and migration and diaspora. Centred primarily on canonical British colonial texts, the first part of the course will explore issues surrounding language, cosmopolitan encounters, Orientalism, modernism and the genres of imperial fantasy. The texts in the second part of the module will be drawn from Africa, South Asia and the Middle East. The intention is to allow students to bring these disparate regions and texts into a productive dialogue by reflecting on their common engagement with colonial and liberation discourses, as well as the legacies of partition. The course further aims to sketch a narrative of empire and decolonisation that links these issues to the context of narrating migration in our contemporary postcolonial world, a subject taken up more directly in the final part of the course.Some brief extracts from critical material on colonial discourse and history, decolonisation, postcoloniality and migration will be considered alongside the primary text each week. Together with a broad primary textual arc that stretches from the British empire to the contemporary metropolis, the course will give students a coherent intellectual narrative with which to explore changing conceptions of culture, history and postcolonial identity across the modern world.

      EN677 - The Contemporary

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of contemporary literature written in English, where contemporary is taken to refer to twenty-first century work. It will equip students with critical ideas and theoretical concepts that will help them to understand the literature of their own time. Students will consider examples of a range of genres: poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction and the essay. They will also be selectively introduced to key ideas in contemporary theory and philosophy. Over the course of the module, students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts. They will consider writers responses to, for instance, questions of migration, environmental change, and financial crisis. They will also consider a range of aesthetic developments and departures, for example: new conceptualism and the claim to unoriginality; the turn to creative non-fiction; the re-emergence of the political essay. The module will not focus on a given national context. Instead it will set contemporary writing against the background of identifiably international issues and concerns. In so doing it will draw attention to non-national publishing strategies and audiences. Overall, the module will aim to show how writers are responding to the present period, how their work illuminates and reflects current cultural concerns. The module will alternate, week by week, between thematic and formal concerns.

      EN672 - Reading Victorian Literature

      
      
       This module aims to introduce students to a wide range of Victorian literature. It will equip students with critical ideas that will help them become more skilful and confident readers of texts in and beyond this period. Students will be encouraged to read texts in a number of contexts: environmental (for example, considering the effects of urbanisation and the Industrial Revolution); imaginative (examining a range of genres such as poetry, novel, short story); political (class conflicts, changing gender roles, ideas of nation and empire); and psychological (representations of sexuality, parent-child relationships, madness, dreams). Students will be made aware of concepts such as modernity and will be encouraged to think about various developments of literary form in the period.

      EN675 - Declaring Independence: 19th Century US Literature

      
      
       When the Long Island-born poet Walt Whitman proclaimed in 1855 that the United States were historys greatest poem he made an important connection between national political culture and literary expression. In some ways this was no exaggeration. As a new experiment in politics and culture, the United States had to be literally written into existence. Beginning with Thomas Jeffersons dramatic Declaration of Independence in 1776, followed by the drafting of the Constitution after the Revolutionary War with Britain, the project of shaping the new United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was essentially a literary one.  In this module we will explore how American writers in this period tried in numerous, diverse ways to locate an original literary voice through which to express their newfound independence. At the same time, the module includes the work of writers who had legitimate grievances against the developing character of a new nation that still saw fit to cling to such Old World traditions as racialized slavery, class conflict and gender inequality.

      EN689 - Modernism

      
      
       This module features key modernist texts, for example the work of Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D., Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Jean Rhys. It also makes substantial reference to key philosophical theories of modernity and textuality. The literary works are taken mostly from a restricted period 1910-1939. Other texts which might form part of the curriculum may include a limited selection of works by F.T. Marinetti, Mina Loy, D.H. Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Samuel Beckett, Mikhail Bakhtin, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Derrida. One focus in the module will be the notion of the artist as applied to the writer as an art-practitioner. Other topics include modes of representation, textuality and identity, the relationship between language and experience, war and democracy, class and politics, notions of exile, cosmopolitanism and bohemianism, sex, morality and city life. This material requires both theoretical and historical orientation, as well as skill in distilling significance from complex literary artefacts with regard to the network of mediations which both bind such works to their apparent context and appear to dislocate them.

      CL310 - Greek for Beginners

      
      
       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL652 - Gods, Heroes and Mystery Cults: Religion in  Ancient Greece

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL713 - Athenian Power Plays

      
      
       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      CL659 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world? This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

       Credits: 30 credits (15 ECTS credits).

      CL663 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences. Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject. Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness. In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject. An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus. The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine. From here, the study will move into the Roman period. Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry. For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen. Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another. Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.

      CL665 - Constantinople and the Late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL666 - Foundations of Britain

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL677 - Fieldwork Practice

      
      
       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL685 - Torture and Sacrifice: the literature of early Christianity

      
      
       The module is intended to give students an introduction to the literature of early Christianity.  A variety of texts will be read  the gospels, apocryphal gospels, early martyrdom texts, edifying tales and hagiography - to show the variety of genres that existed and the intertextual fluidity of these genres. The texts will be contextualised against the historical developments of the Roman Empire. Social and cultural issues will also be raised, such as the new roles of women and men in an emerging Christian world and the concepts of pain, sacrifice, authority, virginity and asceticism will be examined.

      CL692 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

      CL700 - Museum Studies (with internship)

      
      
       The module will allow the student to acquire knowledge and critical understanding of the fundamental principles related to collecting and interpreting objects within museums and managing these institutions. .Students will be required to become familiar and engage critically, during the seminars, with the key references on these topics. Students will then be required to apply concepts and principles learnt in class in the context of their internship.. As part of their internship, each student will devise a special project in consultation with the mentor and the module convenor. Precise objectives and skills to be learnt will be recorded and tracked regularly. Students will keep a weekly log of their activities. The placement may take place either as a block during the Easter vacation of Stage 2 or 3, or at regular intervals over the Autumn and Spring terms.

       This module examines, in detail, Greek history from the end of the Persian invasions to the fall of Athens in 404 BC. The main themes of the module are the rise and fall of the power of Athens, the Peloponnesian War and the role of the Persian Empire in Greek history in the 5th century BC. Particular attention will be paid to the causes of the conflict between Athens and Sparta and to the political and military history of the last three decades of the 5th century BC.

       This module provides an introduction to some of the major works in ancient Greek philosophy in relation to ethics, aesthetics, political theory, ontology and metaphysics. Students will study substantial portions of primary texts by the Pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristotle. The emphasis throughout will be on the philosophical significance of the ideas studied. The module will concentrate on understanding key philosophical arguments and concepts within the context of the ancient Greek intellectual tradition. This means that students will gain a critical distance from normative and modern definitions of philosophical terms in order to understand how Greek philosophy generally approached questions and problems with different suppositions and conceptions of reality, reason and the purpose of human existence.

      EN604 - The Unknown: Reading and Writing

      
      
       The Unknown asks you to think creatively and analytically and to learn by a combination of careful reading and experimental writing.  You will be able to use the skills of critical analysis and close reading developed elsewhere in your degree in new ways and to take a fresh look at the study of literature.  The course draws on the ideas writers have about writing, as well as on psychoanalysis, literary theory, fiction, poetry, drama and film.  It asks you to think deeply about how, and why, you read and write.

      EN676 - Cross-Cultural Coming-of-Age Narratives

      
      
       If the Bildungsroman has been criticised for being outmoded and conservative, how do contemporary writers interrogate and expand its scope and importance? Are coming-of-age narratives merely private stories or can they be read in ways which highlight their social functions, and what kind of theoretical, aesthetic and cultural perspectives can we apply to scrutinise these functions? This module will bring together a range of texts and films from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that can be read within and against the literary tradition of the Bildungsroman or the coming-of-age narrative. Drawing on material from the US, the Caribbean, Asia and Europe, we will spend time analysing the representation of the coming-of-age experience in terms of content and form and assess the ideological functions of the Bildungsroman in a cross-cultural context. Particular attention will be given to questions of racial and ethnic identity, migration, colonialism, memory, trauma, belonging and sexuality. We will also explore the connection of the Bildungsroman with genres such as autobiography, memoir, young adult fiction, travel narrative, graphic novel, and film.

      EN669 - Marriage, Desire and Divorce in Early Modern Literature

      
      
       This module focuses on the theory and practice of marriage and divorce in early modern England and its treatment in the literature of the period. Examining a wide range of texts (drama, poetry, prose works and domestic handbooks alongside documentary sources such as wills, legal records and letters), it will explore the ways in which representations of marriage and its breakdown both reflected and informed the roles of men and women in early modern society. The relationships between discourses about gender, politics and the historical evidence about men and women's married lives in the period will be explored both through reading in the extensive secondary literature of gender, women's history and masculinity as well as through the study of primary sources such as wills, court records, advice books, popular literature (ballads and pamphlets, for example), literary texts (poems, plays and tracts), diaries and personal memoirs and material objects such as wedding rings and scolds bridles, for example. From Shakespeare and Fletcher's dramas of happy and unhappy marriage and Spenser's poetry of marital bliss,  to argument surrounding men and women's roles in marriage in the poetry and pamphlets of Milton and his contemporaries, we will also go in search of the personal accounts of women and men's experiences of marriage and its breakdown and the material artefacts which are testament to them.

      EN666 - From Book to Blog: Geoffrey Chaucer and his Afterlives

      
      
       This module will trace the development of Chaucers literary reputation from his own attempts to forge an authorial legacy to his posthumous instantiation as The Father of English Poetry.  Some of the works of a generation of fifteenth-century followers who addressed Chaucer as a pioneer in vernacular poetry will be read alongside their adaptations of Chaucerian texts and literary techniques. The module will also explore the Chaucerian apocrypha, and assess what these additions to Chaucers literary corpus tell us about the authors fifteenth-century reception. The module will go on to follow some of the history of Chaucer in print, before assessing more modern appropriations of Chaucer in cinema, television and online media.

      EN668 - Discovery Space: New Theatres in Early Modern England

      
      
       This module introduces students to the drama of Shakespeare's time, thinking in particular about the new theatrical buildings and the discoveries they made possible. The module encourages independent study and is consequently built around student interests as they develop their own research questions and essay topic.This period saw the emergence of the first permanent purpose built playhouses, and the development of the theatre industry.  We will consider how the conditions of performance and production  such as playhouse architecture, the reportorial system, printing, censorship and Londons changing urban environment  affected playwrights, actors and audiences. Reading a range of playwrights, students will get a sense of the main trends which shaped the drama of the time, contextualising their understanding of canonical writers such as Shakespeare. Students will also engage with the current developments in early modern theatre history and the ways in which thinking about authorship, staging, printing and other key concepts from the period has altered over the last fifty years. As part of this work, we will examine the phenomena of modern reconstructed playhouses such as Shakespeares Globe, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse and the American Shakespeare Centres Blackfriars, asking what - if anything - modern performance in these spaces can tell us about early modern practices.Office hours will support students in their independent work towards a long essay, whilst weekly two hour seminars will emphasise key moments in the period which will inform the individual interests of all students. Alongside the weekly seminar, the third hour of teaching will be used for workshops, screenings, directed reading/research group meetings and field tips.

      EN684 - Clouds, Waves & Crows: Writing the Natural, 1800 to the Present

      
      
       This module will look at a variety of texts, in a variety of forms, from the early nineteenth century to the present.  The poems, essays, novels, films, paintings and autobiographies all engage with and question our relationship to the world around us.  They sometimes look at nature, but more often ask what it is, what do we use it for, what is our relationship to it, what does it mean for us, what do we make it mean and to what ends, or what is the role that language plays in creating or representing our role in the world? Moreover, while nature may be seen to be something out there the module seeks to ask how it is connected to our understanding of identity, history, or sexuality.The module is not arranged around primary creative texts, and their theoretical accompaniments, but has a more ecological approach to the idea of the creative/critical boundary which means that some weeks core texts may be theoretical ones (such as John Grays Straw Dogs).  This approach is reflected in the modes of assessment where students are invited to produce either two essays, or one traditionally critical one, and one work of creative non-fiction that may encompass aspects of memoir, poetry, psychogeography or philosophy.

       The module focuses on the literary production of North Americas indigenous peoples, drawing on the historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts of one tribe, the Anishinaabeg, or Ojibwe. Students will be encouraged to explore aesthetic and intellectual developments in Native literature and theory; to examine the nature of indigenous status in relation to both North America and the wider world; and to draw on their understanding of canonical literature and literary theory to isolate points of intersection and divergence between Native American and American literatures. We will cover a wide range of literary forms, from transcriptions of oral traditions, through autobiography, to the postmodern novel; and scrutinize and employ a number of strategies of reading the unfamiliar, from ethnological discourse to tribal literary nationalism.The relationship between Native American literature and art will be a key feature of lecture/workshop discussion and, where appropriate, film screenings will be offered.

      EN633 - Bodies of Evidence: Reading The Body In Eighteenth Century Literature

      
      
       This module explores the eighteenth-century fascination with bodies and the truths (or lies) bodies were supposed to reveal. The course focuses on the ways in which the body is read and constructed in eighteenth-century literature and how these readings and constructions reflect various concerns about class, race, gender and sexuality. Through the course of this module we will examine a range of literary representations of the body which seek both to control the body and to celebrate its destructive potential. We will read texts from a variety of genres, including medical literature, misogynist satire, sentimental novels, popular fiction, travel writing and pornography alongside recent critical work by Thomas Lacqueur, Michel Foucault, Roy Porter, Stallybrass and White, which illuminate the ideological stakes writers played for when writing about the body. Topics for discussion will include disability and deformity, race, the sentimental body, dress and the body, the body as a text and the relationship between the body and the body politic. The primary focus of this option will be literature, but we will also examine visual representations of the body in caricature and satire as well as in the portraiture.

       This module explores what fascinates travellers and writers about both familiar and far-flung places. London, Istanbul, Cairo; roads, railways, and rivers; oceans, deserts, and deepest England: each place or mode of travel will be investigated as a source of inspiration, fantasy, and desire. How do invention and authenticity jostle for precedence in fictional as well as factual travel? Does travel writing reveal more about the places visited or the subjectivities of the writers? We will focus on modern writers with glances back to historical precursors. Writers studied should include Jack Kerouac, Orhan Pamuk, Iain Sinclair, Che Guevara, Paul Bowles, Gautam Malkani, Edward Said, Patrick Wright.

      EN656 - Heroes and Exiles: An Introduction to Old English Poetry

      
      
       In July 2009 a treasure-hunter unearthed the most significant hoard of Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever discovered in the British Isles: the Staffordshire Hoard.  The size and diversity of this treasure promises to reveal new insights into Anglo-Saxon life and culture.  But artefacts alone do not tell us everything; to get closer to the minds of those who made and used such items we need to recover the words of the Anglo-Saxons themselves, and this module, with its focus on the small but rich corpus of Old English Poetry, does exactly that.  This is a culture in which pagan and Christian ideals were melded together in ways quite unexpected to the modern mind.  We will discover a preoccupation with heroic deeds of warfare, and a desire to be remembered across the generations for feats of courage; we will also encounter a fear of being isolated from God, and the terrible sense of loss and longing of those who find themselves exiled from their lands and loved ones.  We will read a range of Old English poetry in modern English translations, setting it alongside manuscripts and images of artefacts to consider the ways in which the poetry both reflected and helped to shape Anglo-Saxon culture.  There will be the opportunity to engage at a very introductory level with the Old English language (no previous experience necessary), in order that we can explore the challenges of translating this complex and dazzling poetry into modern English.  The importance attached to the presentation element of assessment reflects the oral nature of Anglo-Saxon poetic culture.  Throughout the term you will receive help and advice on preparing for the presentation, and there will be opportunities to practise anad develop your presentations skills informally.

       This module explores the history and practice of crime fiction in the United States, from the detective stories of Edgar Allen Poe in the 1840s through the evolution of hardboiled narratives in the early and mid-twentieth century, and on into the 21st century novel. Attention is also paid to developments in film and television which parallel those in fiction, such as the birth of film noir and the contemporary cop series. During the course of the term, our readings of crime fiction will be supported by critical and theoretical texts by Franco Moretti, Tzvetan Todorov and others. Topics we will address include the relationship between high and low culture, how and why genres evolve, and the ways in which crime fiction addresses questions of race and gender

       This module will consider a broad variety of Irish writing from about the 1970s to the present, sampling significant developments in poetry, drama and prose. Seminar discussion will focus on recurrent issues addressed in the texts selected for study, such as history, cultural memory, violence and society, queer sexualities and gender relations, national and cultural identities, and the negotiation of what the historian Roy Foster has called the varieties of Irishness.

      EN660 - Writing Lives in Early Modern England: Diaries, Letters and Secret Selv

      
      
       Who wrote about their lives while Shakespeare was writing his plays and Queen Elizabeth was on the throne? Why did they do it, how and by whom did they intend their writing to be read, and what sort of things did they think were interesting about their lives? This module introduces you to the variety of sources available for exploring early modern life writing. Studying better- against less well-known texts (e.g. Anne Cliffords Diary and Shakespeares plays; early modern wills, letters and recipe books), and literary works alongside more pragmatic writings, the module will offer you an opportunity to investigate the private thoughts of the men and women of this crucial period of English history. Writing Lives is for anyone who has ever thought, even briefly, about keeping a diary  it encourages you to consider big questions like the nature of writing; the status of individuality; the forms which identity might take; but also stranger questions such as how the way you wrote a letter might have related to Hamlets To be or not to be speech.

      EN706 - The Love Poem: Wyatt to Nick Cave

      
      
       The Love Poem will tell a history of English poetry through the lens of its most important and singular genre. Students will interrogate the characteristics of modern poetry itself through an investigation of love, desire, gender and intimacy as they have been articulated through the changing lyrical tradition of the language. The module will examine key canonical writers from the beginnings of the English lyric, including Thomas Wyatt and William Shakespeare, through complications in metaphysical poetry, the ballad and Romanticism, up to present day representations of homosexual love, popular song and avant-garde expression. Poets will be studied alongside theorists such as Alain Badiou, Roland Barthes and Henri Bergson, exploring the possible ways in which poetry can be said to challenge dominant modes of love, interact with their social environment through love poetry, and investigate, express and explain the experiences of attraction, attachment and loss.

      EN701 - The Global Eighteenth Century

      
      
       This module will examine the interactions between Britons and the world beyond Europe during the eighteenth century and the different sites of exchange and domination, as well as hybrid cultural articulations, that emerged from these interactions.  We will look at a variety of texts that depict non-European people and places, as well as texts that were read by Britons and written by foreign and colonial peoples, to assess critically the transnational and transatlantic understanding and influences of the period.  We will explore topics such as Cosmopolitanism in the Eighteenth Century, Foreign Influence on British Identity, The Material Culture of Empire, and Transatlantic Culture.  Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the postcolonial study of eighteenth-century literature and the ethical and political implications of these texts and the ways in which we choose to approach them.

      EN703 - The 'Real' America: Class and Culture in the American Gilded Age

      
      
       What is at stake when artists and writers decide to take the real world as the subject of their art? In the later nineteenth century, to depict reality in fiction and art became a radical act of social protest and critique. In an endeavour to locate the truth behind American society, realists moved well beyond pre-existing societal norms to investigate the squalid living conditions of immigrants in the New York slums, participate in Native American religious ceremonies, and probe the psychosexual neuroses of the middle classes. This module explores the American ideology of realism (Michael Elliot) in the late nineteenth- and early- twentieth centuries as expressed in a variety of forms and genres, including: the novel, painting, anthropology and photography. We will discuss the reasons behind the emergence of realism in the later nineteenth century, how it interacted with the new mass culture, whether it critiqued or reinforced dominant racial, sexual, ethnic and class-based prejudices, and, finally, why it declined in the twentieth century as the favoured aesthetic of the American avant-garde. On this module we will move far beyond seeing realism as merely a tame, neutral artistic style to investigate how it pointed to a radical way of seeing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century world.

      EN717 - The Graphic Novel

      
      
       This module focuses on the exploration of the graphic novel as a visual and literary medium. The module will interpret the term graphic novel broadly, and incorporate discussions of comic books, political cartoons, as well as film and television adaptations as a part of its curriculum. The module will begin with an examination of the more mature aesthetic that became increasingly popular for graphic novels during the late 1980s, and examine how these developments have continued to evolve to the present day. Strong emphasis will be placed on readings informed by sociological and political discourses. Students will be encouraged to relate their close analysis of texts to topics such as the distinctions between art and popular culture, and the connections between literary and social history, as well as contemporary concerns such as identity politics, neo-liberal capitalism, protest, and anarchy. As such, the module will demonstrate how the study of graphic novels directly relates to several key concerns in the study of undergraduate English.

       The module is structured around poetry and fiction produced in New York since the war.  The emphasis is primarily upon New York's experimental and avant-garde traditions, and one organising principle is the inter-connectedness of the arts in New York.

      EN714 - Utopia: Philosophy and Literature

      
      
       The module examines some key texts in the theory and literary presentation of utopia. In the first part of the module we will examine classic early utopian texts (Plato, More) and will set these in the context of the modern theory of historical progress (Hegel) the failure of that progress to materialise (Agamben) and the nature of hope for the future (Bloch). In the second part of the module, we will examine modern classics which look at the failure of the communist utopia (Zamyatin, Huxley, Orwell) and at later texts which revived the genre of utopia (LeGuin, Atwood).

      EN715 - Performing Vice c.1350-1550

      
      
       This module explores the representation and performance of sin, vice and misbehaviour in drama, c. 1350-1550.  Students will examine a range of medieval and early Tudor dramatic modes, and will consider how ideas about vice and sin were conveyed through performance, how such presentations worked in conjunction with their virtuous and divine counterparts, the audiences own embodied experience and the potential problems inherent in the bodily pleasures of performance.  Via the study of vice and sin, students will also encounter core aspects of medieval and early Tudor performance culture, dramaturgy, and the material, social and religious conditions that informed drama in this period.  In addition, students will be introduced to a range of non-dramatic primary sources, such as the Records of Early English Drama, medieval philosophy and theology, iconography, spiritual and devotional manuals, and etiquette books, which will sit alongside the playtexts and inform our understanding of medieval concepts of vice.  Modern theories of embodiment, cognition, space, phenomenology and performance will underpin the study of vice on this module and students will be asked to assess the usefulness of these models as a way of critically engaging with medieval and early Tudor drama.

      EN716 - Marxism, Literature and Culture

      
      
       This module offers students a synoptic perspective on Marxist cultural criticism from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day in Europe, Russia and North America. It begins with an analysis of a selection from Marxs own writings, with the aim of introducing key terms, such as alienation, ideology, and dialectic. Students understanding of these terms and their critical uses for literary and cultural studies will develop during the course of the module, as they encounter a range of important Marxist thinkers and their writings. Throughout the module students will be invited to interrogate and transgress the boundaries separating literary from critical texts, and theory from practice. They will be invited to consider creative practice and Marxist criticism in dialogue with one another at particular historical moments. Although anchored in the literary and the textual, the module will also offer opportunities to think critically about the term culture itself in its broadest senses, encompassing a range of aesthetic and social practices, such as sport and music. Progressing through the great class conflicts of the early twentieth century, the Frankfurt School, New Left and anti-racist decolonization movements of the postwar period, up to the contemporary neoliberal moment, the module aims finally to offer students a set of tools with which to understand their own cultural encounters in the present as well as to reconfigure and re-evaluate the cultural knowledge they have accumulated in stages one and two of their degree programmes.

      EN704 - Discord and Devotion: Society & Spirituality in Middle English Literatu

      
      
       This module will introduce students to late-medieval models of social order and, against these official representations, explore how established concepts of identity and social status were debated, destabilized and renegotiated.  Through analysing texts such as William Langlands Piers Plowman, the letters of John Ball, Chaucers Canterbury Tales, selected lyrics and a variety of historiographical texts, the course will investigate the ways in which attempts to control social movement were challenged and contested.  In a period in which traditional feudal social structures were being supplanted by an emergent proto-capitalist economy, the lower orders were demanding a new political platform and English literature reveals both social aspirations and reactionary anxieties.In parallel with the political tumult, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries also saw a rise in non-official, heterodox forms of spirituality, licensing individual devotional practices that similarly challenged the perceived hegemony of the Church.  Investigating works of affective devotion, like The Book of Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwichs Revelations of Divine Love, and a variety of religious lyrics and plays, in addition to Wycliffite and Lollard sermons, the module will uncover the growing popularity of devotional forms predicated upon a personal relationship with and experience of the divine.  These practices (like their political counterparts) decentred spiritual authority and reveal a theological ambition which problematised orthodox religion in multiple ways.  Within these reimagined visions of social and religious structures are the seeds of new ideas that would shape the future of the English nation; in such visions the common man gains power and authority, women are empowered as spiritual leaders, and the authority of Church and State is subject to lay criticism and intervention.

      EN705 - The Contemporary Memoir

      
      
       Why is the memoir such a popular genre in contemporary literature? Are memoirs individualistic, sentimental and voyeuristic (what is often dismissed as misery literature) or can they have strong ethical impulses and powerful real-world effects? This course critically examines the significance of the memoir  a first-person account of a part of ones life, often written by someone not previously known as a writer in late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century literature. Through reading a range of recent memoirs we will examine the themes, techniques and debates that have come to characterise this genre. Drawing on a range of aesthetic, theoretical and cultural perspectives, we will approach these memoirs both as literature  as rich sources for critical analysis and capable of transforming academic criticism  and in terms of their appeal, and sometimes controversial reception, within present-day mass audiences.  We will also expand our discussion of memoirs to consider graphic narrative and film.

       This module will explore the range of Hardy's work including his novels, some short fiction poetry, prose, and autobiography, in the light of specifically nineteenth-century concerns such as the emergence of modernity, the impact of science, the beginnings of modernism, and the shift from the rural to the urban.  Themes to be explored will include Hardys changing position as an author throughout his career; his development of forms of narrative; his views on history and philosophy; the representation of class; anxieties about social, cultural and economic change; the status of the human and the animal; his interest in evolutionary theory and its widespread effect; and finally, his career and position as a twentieth-century poet.

       What is the relationship between animal and human, and how is this explored through writing? This module seeks to examine creaturely relations by focusing on literature from the 18th century up to the present, alongside key theoretical and contextual material that engages with questions concerning animality and humanity. We will focus on how writers imagine distinct animal worlds as well as how they understand the role of animals in human cultures. A range of novels, short stories and poems will raise questions about how we look at, think with, and try to give voice to animals, and topics covered will include Becoming Animal, Listening to Animals, Animal Experiments' and Tasting Animals. Students taking this module will gain a firm grounding in the diverse critical field known as animal studies, whilst also considering the broader cultural, philosophical and ethical implications  of how we think about the relationship between humans and animals.

      EN710 - Victorian Aestheticism and Decadence

      
      
       This module is an intensive study of aesthetic and decadent literature in late Victorian Britain. We will explore some of the key literary and critical works that popularised the concept of the 'aesthetic' and the ideal of the aesthetic life, and examine how and why 'art for art's sake' and 'decadence' came to be understood as the watchwords of a countercultural movement. The module also takes in along its way some of the manifestos, scandals, satires, and controversies that made aestheticism and decadence vivid in the public imagination, such as the 'Fleshly School of Poetry' controversy, the notorious periodical The Yellow Book, and the three trials of Oscar Wilde. This module pays particular attention to the relationship between the literary and visual arts, and aims to help students gain a sophisticated understanding of the intellectual and imaginative stakes of Victorian aestheticism and decadence, as well as of the social and material contexts from which a 'cult of beauty' arose in late Victorian Britain. We will consider the ways in which Aestheticism and Decadence look backward to Romanticism and forward to Modernism; how they became a means of imagining alternative sexualities, identities, and lifestyles; and how they clarify (or falsify) the relations between art, ethics, and politics.

       London became a metropolis in the sixteenth century  it grew wildly in size and its big city status made it the entertainment capital of England. This module analyses the relationship between a developing city and an expanding cultural life in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. It considers the increase in playhouses, shopping, street life, religious life and public shaming. It explores the dynamics between urban life and writing  the way Londoners wrote about their city, the way satirists punctured its self-image, the way courts recorded its crimes and the way entertainment was scripted. It investigates the interplay between spontaneous popular culture and structured civic entertainment, and between court culture and prostitution. Topics to be covered include mapping the city: Stowes Survey; working London: street cries and the water poet; street performances: sermons and book burnings; women on the margins: cony catching and prostitution; and shopping in London: the new exchange and its plays.

       While the so-called Bront&euml; myth remains potent in popular culture today, the lives-and-works model associated with it continues to encourage readers to seek partially concealed Bront&euml; sisters in their fictions. Beginning and ending with the problematic of mythmaking  its origins in Gaskells 'Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;' and its subsequent perpetuation in film and other rewritings - this module will restore attention to the rich literary contribution made by the sisters through an intensive focus on their novels and selected poetry in the context of Victorian debates about gender and the woman question. Situating the Bront&euml;  myth in relation to other forms of mythmaking in the period (for example, ideologies of class, gender and empire), it will consider a small selection of film adaptations and go on to examine the Bront&euml;ss experiments with narrative voice and form, their variations upon the novel of education, the tensions between romance and realism in their writing and their engagement with religious and philosophical questions as well with the political, economic and social conditions of women in mid-Victorian culture. We will also consider a range of modern creative and critical engagements with the Bront&euml;s' literary works..

       Unruly Women & Other Insubordinates:   The Dramatic Repertoire of the Queen Anna's Men (1604-1625) The Jacobean period is renowned for producing some of the most incisive, inventive, and interrogative drama in the English language --  plays which both delve into the darker corners of human experience (lust, temptation, sin, revenge) and affirm positive values for humanity (love, compassion, tolerance).  In this challenging module we will study a selection of plays in the context of the dramatic company that performed them,  Queen Annas Men.  In so doing we will engage with immediate contexts of dramatic production in the period: the organisation, work, and role of the dramatic company; the impact of playhouses and their audiences; the often collaborative nature of playwriting (particularly the work of Thomas Heywood, but also that of  John Day, Thomas Dekker, William Rowley and  John Webster).  We will also pay attention to the literary qualities of these plays, especially their complexities of genre (comedy, tragedy, tragi-comedy) and subtleties of language.  Combining literary analysis with an attention to the specific work of one dramatic company, this module offers an innovative approach to Jacobean drama that enables reach fresh readings of both familiar and neglected plays in the period.

      EN646 - Image, Vision and Dream: Medieval Texts and  Visual Culture

      
      
       This module explores the complex relationships between written and visual culture, the latter including both artefacts such as paintings and sculpture, and the products of visual imagination such as dreams and visions.  We will ask questions such as: Can images really be innocent representations, or are they always replete with social, political and ideological significations?  In what ways might we 'read' images in order to recover those significations?  Where text and images appear together, is the relationship between them hierarchical, or are other kinds of relationship possible?  How might we blur the boundaries between text and image, for example in the case of narrative images, or descriptive and imagistic texts?  The rich textual and visual culture of the Middle Ages is used as a starting point, a lens through which you will have the opportunity to explore these questions from a range of angles, including the semiotic theories developed by Barthes as well as more traditional art-historical approaches.  We will explore texts from a variety of genres, including dream poetry and religious vision, alongside images in manuscripts, wall paintings, stained glass and sculpture.  The project element of the assessment offers you the opportunity to undertake independent research on any aspect of the module you choose (whether medieval or not); topics chosen in recent years have ranged from an exploration of meaning in medieval maps to a study of the iconography employed by Lady Gaga in videos and other publicity materials.

       Poetry and Crisis will tell a history of twentieth-century poetry through the lens of the major political events that have shaped it. Addressing key social issues including economic crisis, class, nation, war and postcolonialism, the module will investigate both key figures in the history of mainstream poetic tradition (W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Derek Walcott) and more experimental and collaborative movements such as proletarian realism, Language Poetry and art associated with the Occupy movement. Within these traditions, students will explore the possible ways in which poetry can be said to articulate, respond to and intervene in political crisis.

       This module will bring together works of poetry and fiction by a number of black writers in the USA and Canada in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. With a particular emphasis on migration, music, and urban space, we will explore the intellectual, political, and aesthetic imperatives that drive these writers to address questions of race, ethnicity, gender, belonging, representation, poverty, privilege, and trauma. Beginning in Harlem in the 1920s, the moment when the Negro was in vogue, students will examine the ways in which black Americans and Canadians have sought to make their impact on the literary landscape, by turns exposing and employing the power structures of the dominant culture. This comparative look at US and Canadian literatures, however, also challenges students to scrutinize the construction of literary and other categories, and to consider the commonality and distinctive difference between black experience north and south of the 49th parallel. Lectures/workshops will emphasise discussion of key moments and movements in African American / African Canadian arts; the significance of linguistic distinctiveness; the cultural self-categorisation of black, African American, Africadian and Halfrican identities; and the rise of African American literary theory.

      EN670 - Lyric, Ballad and Popular Song

      
      
       This course looks at how British and American popular song has been collected and transformed by literary professionals (particularly poets and academics) from the eighteenth century to the present day. The focus of the module is on poetry that has its origins in vernacular traditions of ballad singing, but its purview takes in all sorts of writings that are apt to be sung, or that have the vocal/lyrical medium as a significant element of their textual identity. The course is structured as a historical survey, tracing succeeding attempts by collectors, academics, poets and singers to preserve and to adapt such songs. It progresses from eighteenth-century and romantic-period ballad collectors such as Thomas Percy and Walter Scott, through revivalists such as Francis James Child, Lady Gregory, Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp, to contemporary popular musicians who draw on oral sources, such as Bob Dylan and P.J. Harvey. Students will be encouraged to consider how the figure of the singer and the act of singing have been used by poets (Gray, McPherson, Wordsworth, Dickinson, Hardy, Yeats, Gurney, Auden, Bishop) in figurative representations both of the inherited component of literary culture, and of the sublime (or otherwise ineffable) component of their particular art, poetry. Through discussions of theoretical texts students will be encouraged to consider the contrasting functions of poetic language from the perspectives of speech, lyric, narrative and vocalized song. The broad aims of the course are to help students find a critical idiom through which to describe the textual interdependence of inscribed, vocalized and musical articulations; to trace historical changes in that relationship; and to understand the ideological contexts of those changes in succeeding ages of nation-building, of empire, of world war, and of globalization.

      CL691 - Monsters in Roman Literature

      
      
       This module explores the monsters of Roman culture, mythological and otherwise, treated as a series of self-contained but interrelated topics. Most were inherited from Greece but adapted for new tastes and purposes. Latin poetry in translation is the focus, and Virgils Aeneid and Ovids Metamorphoses are the central texts, but prose sources and the visual arts are included where appropriate, as well as comparisons with earlier Greek sources. Major figures such as the Cyclopes, the Centaurs and Medusa are included, but the definition of the monster is broad, incorporating (for example) the supposed bodily imperfections of emperors, or the strange features of personified figures such as Hunger and Envy. Lectures offering broader perspectives are complemented by seminars which focus on the analysis of specific passages of text.

      CL677 - Fieldwork Practice

      
      
       This module will provide a credit framework for fieldwork training undertaken on University of Kent training excavations, or approved partners, normally supported by a SECL archaeological fieldwork bursary, to assist with the costs involved in a participation of 15 working days. The module will permit three alternative pathways, in excavation, survey or museum studies. Assessment will be in the form of an illustrated portfolio featuring a description of the project and an account of each type of work undertaken by the student. Project directors will be provided with a checklist of fieldwork tasks to be completed, of which a minimum number will be mandatory. Students who have no prior experience of fieldwork will likely be accommodated on a project in the UK, whilst those who are experienced may be offered a place on an excavation abroad. Skills assessed will range from efficient manual digging and artefact washing to site / find drawing or photography and the completing of pro-forma record sheets.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL714 - Athenian Power Plays

      
      
       This module explores 5th-century Athenian history through the plays which were put on stage during this period of war and political upheaval. Greek tragedies and comedies produced during this tumultuous period (472-405 BC) offer us some of the most enticing, yet challenging, evidence for the state of Athenian politics and attitudes to contemporary events (especially war and empire). In this module, the evidence of key plays will be set against other forms of historical evidence to illuminate the complex relationship between the types of evidence which survive and the nature of 'making history'.

      CL652 - Gods, Heroes and Mystery Cults: Religion in  Ancient Greece

      
      
       This module is an introduction to ancient Greek religion and Mystery cults.  The module will offer an introduction to the major gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, spheres of influence, character, relationships, exploits, and worship.  It is concerned with the analysis of religious festivals, cults, beliefs, and the development of religious architecture.  The module will additionally briefly contrast Greek religion to Christianity, as an example of investigating how Greek religion differs from, and resembles, modern religions.  The materials of the course are drawn from the ancient Greeks themselves from archaeology, Greek poets, artists, playwrights, mythographers, and philosophers from the 10th2nd centuries BC.

      CL650 - Graeco-Roman Egypt

      
      
       This module is concerned with the impact of the Classical World on ancient Egypt between Alexanders invasion and the Arab conquest, and on the nature and permanence of the brilliant hybrid civilization which emerged under Greek and Roman rule. Alexander entered Egypt as a liberator, but he and his successors created a colonial regime with Greek as the ruling language and Greeks as the ruling elite under their own law. Mercenaries were settled on reclaimed land, Greek cities were founded, especially Alexandria, one of the glories of the ancient world. An elaborate system of economic regulation maximised production to support warfare, city-building and display. The temples became a department of state. New cults were created to unite the two peoples and strengthen the regime. Native Egyptians showed their resentment in disaffection and rebellion. Roman rule (after the spectacular end of the Ptolemaic dynasty) was if anything harsher and more remote, and the rise of the Copts is often interpreted as an anti-Roman, anti-Classical movement.Yet it is a mistake to see the relationship as wholly negative. Art and architecture flourished  most temples surviving today are the work of the Ptolemies. In civil service, army, business the new regime offered avenues to advancement for native Egyptians. A genuinely bilingual upper class emerged, able to make significant contributions to Classical culture. The ancient religion retained its prestige and was adopted by many Greeks, spreading far outside Egypt. Coptic culture was as much Classical as Egyptian, and Greek language long survived the Arab conquest.Sources for this vivid, complex and often neglected phase of Egyptian history are rich and varied: temples, tombs, remains of cities and villages, mummies, inscriptions, sculpture, coins, and an extraordinary range of papyrus documents, able to offer unique insights into an ancient civilization.

      CL604 - Roman and Medieval Artefacts

      
      
       Centred around weekly practical sessions with artefacts at the Canterbury Museum Education Resource Centre, this course provides an introduction to Roman and Medieval artefacts. Students will learn to draw and identify Roman and Medieval material at first hand, including coins, pottery and metalwork, and the accompanying seminars will explore methods for the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and their contribution to Roman and Medieval studies. Topics will include the study of artefacts as grave assemblages, the relationship between art styles and artefacts in the ancient world, the presentation of artefacts in museum displays and their use in the construction and communication of identity.

      CL607 - Greek and Roman Medicine

      
      
       When questioning people about their understandings of classical medicine two extreme responses are usually given, the first that there was no medicine, or a very crude and ritualistic form of healing and the second response being that it was entirely rational with no religious influences.  Yet, both responses demonstrate a narrow understanding of the subject.  Classical medicine was a complex mixture of what we would consider rational and irrational ideas and practices for the causes and cures of disease and illness.  In this module students will use the various sources of evidence that survive in the literary, archaeological and epigraphic record to learn about the subject.  An historical approach will be used starting with and examination of the pre-Socratic philosophers and Hippocratic writers ideas about the body and medicine, moving into the Hellenistic period examining the dissections and vivisections of Herophilus and Erasistratus.  The archaeological material from Greek healing sanctuaries will add to the understanding of Greek medicine.  From here, the study will move into the Roman period.  Questions will be addressed about the influence of Greek medicine on Roman medicine and the archaeological remains of instruments and buildings associated with healing, such as baths, sanctuaries and possible hospitals will be examined as part of this enquiry.  For the Roman period the works of Celsus and Pliny the Elder will be read for the first century AD and the module will culminate with a study of the second century writer Galen.  Throughout the class students will examine ideas about rationality and medical influences from one society to another.  Overall the student will come away with a strong understanding of the many issues of classical medicine.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

       The module is based on individual scholarship and research supplemented by group guidance seminars and one-to-one supervisions.The project will be chosen by the student with the advice of the tutor. In terms of  the primary data it could involve investigation of antiquarian literature; archive documentation including cartographic sources; Sites and Monuments Records; museum collections; observation of monuments in the field; or participation in approved field work or excavation. Engagement with some types of primary data may be recorded in the form of a log which can appropriately be included as a component of the final report on the project. Choice of project will be informed by personal interests, the fulfilment of the aims of the module, the availability of expert supervision, and the accessibility of data. Typically the project may have a local or regional focus.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL639 - Constantinople and the late Antique City

      
      
       This course will survey the evolution of the Mediterranean city from AD 300 to 650, the urban crisis which followed, and the direction which urban life took thereafter. City life in this period was until recently poorly understood, hindered by the prejudices of classical archaeologists, who removed late levels without record, and the selective interests of Christian archaeologists who concentrated on churches. Now new archaeological fieldwork has revealed much greater complexity, from urban collapse in the West to the flourishing cities of the 6th c. East, which provided a foundation for much of Early Islamic urbanism. Although north-west Europe is included, the main focus is the Mediterranean, where urban life was strongest, throughout the period. Lectures will explore both thematic and regional syntheses, with a major distinction drawn, not between a Greek East and a Latin West, but between a Mediterranean core and a northern periphery. An attempt will be made to link changes in the physical appearance of cities to wider events and processes: whether military, political, religious or economic in character. Seminars will explore aspects of the rich source material available, whether drawn from architectural remains, stratigraphic archaeology, epigraphy, or selected written sources of the period.This module is subject to change pending faculty approval

      CL583 - The Crisis of the Roman Republic

      
      
       Roman history in this period is dominated by two events: the acquisition by Rome of an overseas empire and the gradual disintegration of the Republican state.   Both these developments will be examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to Rome's Diplomatic and military confrontations with the Hellenistic powers of the Eastern Mediterranean and their effect on Roman social, political and intellectual behaviour. The student will read a wide range of ancient sources, from Polybius to Cicero.

      CL590 - The Foundations of Britain: Archaeology of the first Millenium B.C.

      
      
       Across much of Britain by the Late Bronze Age (from c. 1000 BC) economic and social organisation was beginning to assume forms which provided the foundations for subsequent fundamental transformations seen through the First Millennium BC: in population, in agriculture, in technology, in land holding and power and cultural forms. The period saw the emergence of technologies, manufacturing and craft skills, social structures and belief systems, husbandry and movement of enduring influence. The unfolding of this formative period, with its efficiently managed landscape dotted with farmsteads and hillforts, lavish metalwork and occasionally exotic burials, and its fluctuating and enigmatic relationships with mainland Europe, is accessible mostly through archaeological study alone: and what a rich resource that has proved to be, especially through recent studies and techniques. Only at the very end does limited historical information become available when we are told of the presence of chariot borne warriors, kings, queens and Druids. The module spans the late Bronze and Iron Ages, presenting the often dramatic and striking archaeological and historical data within current interpretative frameworks. All parts of the British Isles come into focus. Settlements, burials, material culture, environmental remains and monuments are explored revealing a richly nuaned matrix of cultural evidence which inspires interrogation and interpretation.

      CL591 - Barbarians in the West

      
      
       How did the Western Roman Empire undergo its transformation into the early medieval world?  This course provides an overview of the period between 400 and 600 A.D., in particular, examining the collision between barbarian and Roman in late Antiquity and the development of the post-Roman and early medieval West, focusing on changes in culture and society through a critical evaluation of evidence from history, art, architecture and archaeology. There will be a focus on Italy, France and Britain which is intended to 1) provide a manageable and structured course at an appropriate level of detail, with the potential for some depth of analysis, and 2) concentrate on those geographical areas which mesh closely with the subject matter of other courses in Roman archaeology and late Antique and medieval history offered by colleagues in the Classical and Archaeological Studies and History departments.

       This course is designed for students who have not been exposed to any other highly inflected language. It aims at teaching students to read and understand ancient Greek within the context of fifth century BCE Greek civilisation and culture, by providing them with knowledge of ancient Greek grammar, syntax and culture. Grammatical theory is taught as a tool for dealing with the texts, understanding and gradually translating them. At the same time, productive use of the ancient Greek language, i.e. composition of simple sentences in ancient Greek is also taught. Students will gain sufficient understanding of Greek grammar and syntax to enable them to translate Greek prose and verse. In addition, the study of ancient Greek will enrich the students vocabulary.

      CL504 - Classical & Archaeological Studies Dissertation

      
      
       This module is intended to introduce undergraduate students to research. As such it provides an opportunity to work on a topic of their own choosing, in either archaeology, history or ancient literature. Originality and feasibility are important aspects of writing dissertations, and to avoid problems topics will be scrutinised and approved by CLAS before research can begin. Students can expect guidance from the module convenor and an academic supervisor throughout the process, varying from one-to-one tutorials to classes on how to edit your own prose. There will also be a meeting regarding the Dissertation at the end of the Spring term of the previous year to clarify arrangements and to outline what work is required on this module.The programme document with regulations is sent to all students at the end of spring term of Stage 2. Students are invited to suggest titles for comment, for which tutors are allocated. They are advised to do preliminary reading over the summer based on generic advice of the module convenor. They then choose precise topics in consultation with the convenor and personal tutors at the start of the autumn term. This module is subject to change pending faculty approval
