Entry requirements    Please see our Clearing and Adjustment vacancies page for a full list of subjects available and our entry requirements.   -->     Home/EU students   The University will consider applications from students offering a wide range of qualifications, typical requirements are listed below, students offering alternative qualifications should contact the Admissions Office for further advice. It is not possible to offer places to all students who meet this typical offer/minimum requirement.           Qualification    Typical offer/minimum requirement            A level    To be eligible to study on the MArch programme, you need to have completed an office-based internship for a minimum of six months, following successful completion of a good first degree in architecture. Traditionally students entering the MArch with a first degree that gives exemption from ARB/RIBA Part 1 graduate with the award of MArch (with ARB and RIBA Part 2 exemption). International Entrants without ARB/RIBA Part 1 exemption (or with RIBA but not ARB Part 1 exemption) will also qualify for the same award. Any student already following the MArch, without ARB Part 1, or without a first degree giving exemption from ARB Part 1, may apply directly to the ARB to take ARB Part 1 as an external candidate. This would involve paying a fee, submitting a portfolio, and attending an interview in London. Procedures are explained at the ARB website  www.arb.org.uk/student Please note: we do not arrange this, and cannot guarantee success but will offer advice to students enrolled on the MArch in advance of their direct approach to ARB. This may be of advantage to students specifically seeking an MArch award with RIBA Pt 2 exemption, as successfully obtaining ARB Part 1 directly from ARB before graduation would graduate with the award of MArch (with ARB & RIBA Part 2 exemption).   MArch graduates without ARB Pt 1 or a qualification giving exemption, will need to obtain both a recognised ARB Part 1 and Part 3 before they can apply to the ARB to be registered in the UK as &lsquo;Architect&rsquo;.
