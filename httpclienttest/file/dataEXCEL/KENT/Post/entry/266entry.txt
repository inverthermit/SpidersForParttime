Entry requirements Applicants will be expected to have achieved at least a strong 2:1 in their undergraduate degree. Your application must include a link to an example of your film practice (password-protected if necessary) and a treatment (max 1000 words) for a 10-20 minute short fiction film that you would like to make. The fiction treatment is a piece of highly visual prose writing that contains the action of your story from beginning to end.   It is not a script and will not contain dialogue or shot descriptions. It must be written in the present tense. A well-written treatment evokes the style, tone and genre of the film, and suggests a sense of place, characters and key motifs. If your story contains a central character, he or she should come alive in the treatment and the reader should begin to &lsquo;see' the film.
