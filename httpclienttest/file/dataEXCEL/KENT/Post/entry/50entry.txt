Entry requirements A first or upper-second class honours degree in a relevant subject (or equivalent), or substantial creative writing experience. You are required to submit a sample of your creative writing, and this will be the most significant factor in admissions decisions. Writing Sample A piece or portfolio of creative work should be uploaded on the &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; page of the online application form. If fiction, this should be around 1,500&ndash;2,000 words; if poetry, approximately 4 pages. On the &lsquo;Course Details&rsquo; page, you should submit a description of around 300 words of your creative writing plans. Please tell us whether you intend to work in fiction, poetry, or narrative non-fiction and what experience you have working in this form. Please also give some indication of the concerns, style, ideas and/or themes that you are interested in exploring in your work. Request for consideration on the grounds of equivalent professional status Candidates who hold no first degree, or a first degree in a non-literary/creative subject area should include in their applications a summary of any information that might allow us to support the application on the grounds of &lsquo;equivalent professional status&rsquo;.   This could include previous writing publication credits or other successes and/or relevant professional achievements.
