   TH830 - Religion and European Thought (Paris)


   
    In recent decades European intellectual culture has seen a turn towards the post-secular, the post-critical, the return of religion, or, as Claude Lefort described it the permanency of the theologico-political.  Such gestures invite a rethinking of the political, social, and intellectual role of religion in the recent history of European thought.   Such reworking intimately affects the understanding of Europe within a scene of global political and economic development, European traditions of philosophy, concepts of political autonomy; its critical theories of culture and economy, links between the idea of Europe and democratic political foundations; and the nature of artistic, social, and psychological exploration.  This course creates capacities to interact with and to intervene in these important and on-going cultural discussions by developing new maps of religion as a central preoccupation in the formation of European intellectual identity, with a strong focus on Paris and the history of religion in French theory (e.g the works of Badiou, Benslama, Derrida and Foucault).

   TH831 - Spirituality and Therapy


   
    The module will develop an understanding of what in ancient, non-Western, and modern European contexts are the historical and conceptual relationships between therapy, spiritual exercise, medical discourse, the search for wisdom or insight, and the critique of cultural life.How do the different ancient, non-Western and modern or contemporary traditions imagine happiness, enjoyment, or bliss, and what is the imagined relationship between these states and the goal of therapeutic practice?  Might something like a general theory of therapeutics, spiritual exercise, or anthropotechnics constitute an overarching category that unites what we normally imagine to be distinct areas of philosophy, psychology, religion, and clinical practice?This comparative module explores how modern psychological and psychoanalytic therapies have more to do with religious traditions of spiritual exercise than tends to be indicated by academic disciplines, acknowledged by professional therapeutic societies, or actively explored in the development of new therapeutic models.

   TH832 - The Study of Religion: Genealogies, Inventions and Interventions


   
    The category of religion is hardwired into histories of Enlightenment, modernity, and post-modernity to the point that it is now difficult to discuss any of these periods without negotiating religion as a problem of central importance.  This course develops a multidisciplinary mapping of religion as an object of academic research in order to better understand the polemics, politics, assumptions and everyday practices which continue to determine the status of religion.  Working with various subfields within the study of religion, this comparative and collaborative course develops new maps of mutual influence, borrowing, translation and struggle between subfields, all of which produced the dominant images of religion within university and popular cultural contexts alike.Indicative topics include: how and why did the study of religion emerge as a human science opposed to earlier research on theology? What cultural and political projects shaped the category of world religion?  How did scholars of biblical and European traditions react to nineteenth-century developments in the study of Buddhist and Hindu traditions?  What were the political tendencies behind modern European and North American denigrations of ritualized practice in favour of religion as the study of belief?  What were universities roles in establishing the limits and value of the concept of the secular, and why are so many academic discussions of religion currently so keen to dislodge the same concept?Students will learn to engage in sophisticated ways with classic primary texts by those who lastingly shaped the modern invention of the academic study of religion, figures like G. W. F. Hegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Max M&uuml;ller, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Lucien L&eacute;vy-Bruhl, Sigmund Freud, Marcel Mauss.

   CP807 - Diaspora and Exile


   
    The ubiquity of the term diaspora in recent critical debates has been interpreted as the symptom of a shift in perspective in cultural and social studies. This is reflected in the growing significance of diaspora studies which, to some extent, has superseded postcolonial studies as a theoretical framework in explaining those global phenomena in society, culture and literature which are informed by conceptions of the nation state but cannot sufficiently be explained by them. At the same time, tendencies of universalising conceptions of diaspora as they have recently proliferated and the increasingly simplifying and historically undifferentiated usage of the term need to be reconsidered. Among the various paradigms from which diasporic writing should be distinguished is the literature of exile. Exile is often the consequence of political pressure or disaffection with a society rather than the result of the larger and often spatially and chronologically extended migratory movements which led to the emergence of diasporic communities. While both paradigms may intersect, the concerns and motivations of diasporic and exilic literatures usually differ. A historically and culturally significant geographical, and frequently also imaginary, point of intersection between the diasporic and the exilic paradigms is the metropolis of Paris. In this module, our comparative focus will be on diasporic and exilic literatures and on the significance of the diasporic or exilic space of the French metropolis, both as production context and as informing literary production. Arguably, the most famous group of exiles to choose Paris as their temporary home was the generation of American expatriate writers in the 1920s for whom, as J. Gerald Kennedy suggests, Paris inescapably reflect[ed] the creation of an exilic self  Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Djuna Barnes or, after the Second World War, Richard Wright, James Baldwin and Alexander Trocchi or Boris Vian. Other writers of note who, in different times and under different conditions, chose exile in Paris include Heinrich Heine, Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke, Samuel Beckett, Heinrich Mann or Anna Seghers, Miguel &Aacute;ngel Asturias, Czeslaw Milosz, Milan Kundera, Jorge Sempr&uacute;n and Marjane Satrapi or Julio Cort&aacute;zar, Severo Sarduy, Vargas Llosa, Alfredo Bryce Echenique, Laura Alcoba, Assia Djebar, Nancy Houston and Leila Sebbar. Incorporating aesthetic dimensions, our seminars will explore in particular the extent to which experiences of diaspora and exile inform the work of alien writers residing in Paris.

   FR803 - Paris and the European Enlightenment


   
    This module is designed to examine the overlapping influence of Early Modern and Enlightenment thinkers and writers mainly based in England, France and Germany. A particular focus is provided by the Parisian setting: several key figures (such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Diderot) lived in Paris for a significant part of their lives, and Paris was a city second to none in its importance within a vast international exchange of ideas during the Enlightenment period. The module will encourage students to consider the historical contexts out of which the various texts emerge, and show how ideas passed between England, France, Germany and elsewhere. Attention will consistently be paid to the tension between Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment in Europe. This will include allowing the students to understand debates, in the eighteenth century (and, if appropriate, since then), around the following issues: empiricism; sensationism; toleration; freedom of speech; aesthetics; literary genres; the 'pre-Romantic'.

   FR820 - Paris: Reality and Representation


   
    The curriculum includes a selection of texts from various countries, all readily available in English and all specifically relevant to the modern history, evolving population and changing appearance of Paris and to how these aspects of the city has been perceived and represented in literary prose. The set texts are by writers from different periods and of various nationalities and they are all set in and inspired by Paris. The texts are chosen for their high literary quality, but also because they represent essential aspects of the citys evolution and exemplify various narrative strategies and ways of engaging with the realities of life in the city, always shaped by personal preoccupations and sensibilities. This varied selection within the genre of prose fiction allows study of Zolas naturalism and his presentation of the political and aesthetic implications of baron Haussmans plans for urban renewal and control; Edith Whartons perspective as an American incomer; Andr&eacute; Bretons combination of oneiric urban encounters with photographic illustrations of the city, inserted into the text; Jean Rhyss clearly gendered experience of the city in the 1920s and 1930s; the identity of the city as a site for postwar liberation and literary dynamism in the work of expatriates from the Beat generation; and the representation of todays city as a centre for immigrant communities and cultural diversity. The primary texts are thus all Paris-focussed but are chosen to open an international perspective on the literary representation of an increasingly cosmopolitan city.
