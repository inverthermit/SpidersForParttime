Course structure


 The MSc in Applied Health Research is designed to be studied over one year full-time or two years part-time. There are three compulsory modules, plus four optional modules. To be awarded a MSc in Applied Health Research students are required to obtain 180 M level credits including the dissertation module which comprises 60 credits.

The programme is divided into 2 stages.

Stage 1 comprises taught modules totalling 120 credits. Postgraduate students are required to obtain 60 credits of core modules, and 60 credits from a choice of optional modules.

Stage 2 students are required to obtain 60 credits through a compulsory dissertation module. You must successfully complete each module in order to be awarded the specified number of credits for that module. One credit corresponds to approximately ten hours of 'learning time' (including all classes and all private study and research). Thus obtaining 180 credits in an academic year requires 1,800 hours of overall learning time.

Compulsory modules are currently:
Introduction to Applied Health Research; Quantitative Methods in Health Research and Qualitative Methods in Health Research.

With the agreement of the programme director, students will be able to take an elective/wild module as an optional module from across the School (with the appropriate credit volume).

At Stage 2, students are required to complete a 12-15,000 word dissertation on a subject of their choice.

   SO955 - Quantitative Methods in Health Research


   
    Choosing and designing the most appropriate method to address a clinical question is paramount in generating the best evidence. The aims of this module are to equip students with the requisite skills to apply the scientific approach and the basics of critical appraisal to quantitative methods used within the context of research evaluating health care interventions. This should enable participants to formulate research ideas and identify appropriate methods with which to test their hypotheses. They will also become critical consumers of research with the knowledge and understanding necessary to evaluate research appropriately.The module provides an introduction to a range quantitative research methods that are commonly used within applied health research including secondary (systematic reviews and meta-analysis) and primary methods (cohort studies, case control and randomised controlled trials). Much of the module will be devoted to providing an overview of the development pathway for interventions within the context of randomised controlled trials. Students will learn about the techniques of trial design and the role and importance of discrete projects for the demonstration of proof of concept, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness.As students learn to identify the strengths and weaknesses of 6 key study designs, they will also learn how to design a research protocol. Participants will design data collection and analysis. They will also learn strategies to manage bias and assess the quality of published research. The module includes exposure to the techniques involved in analysing quantitative data, as well as considering ethical and governance issues relating to research within the context of the NHS.Each week students are provided with research articles that are compulsory reading for discussion in seminars/workshops. Each reading provides an example of methods as used in research, their potential in addressing specific kinds of research questions, and their relevance for evaluating health interventions.
