Course structure


 In addition to the core module (Reading the Contemporary, taught jointly by academics and practitioners in the School of English, the School of Arts, The School of Music and Fine Art, and curators at the ICA), you will be able to choose from a wide variety of modules in the areas of contemporary literature, creative writing, film, drama, and history and philosophy of art. You are invited to attend an induction at the ICA at the start of your studies to introduce you to the facilities and are encouraged to make use of the ICA&rsquo;s programme of seminars and events. In addition, the MA will also involve research trips and a public presentation opportunity at the ICA.

Professional development

Besides engaging with ICA curators through the core module in Reading the Contemporary, students will also participate in three research trips in the autumn, spring and summer terms, led by ICA curators and responding to contemporary artistic developments, media and platforms. Students will be encouraged to apply to vocational placements within the ICA's Creative Team for two days a week over three months, working directly with the curators of Talks, Exhibitions, Artists' Film Club, Cinema or Learning and Touring programmes. Students will enjoy unique access to the knowledge of the ICA's Creative Team while working on they final project, and will have the opportunity to present their projects publicly at the ICA at the end of the year.




 Modules


 You take one compulsory module (EN842 - Reading the Contemporary) plus one additional module in the autumn term and two in the spring term. You are also expected to attend the Faculty and School Research Methods Programmes. You then write the dissertation between the start of the summer term and the end of August. The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.


 

      
   EN842 - Reading the Contemporary


   
    'Reading the Contemporary' is a cross-disciplinary module the aim of which is to find out what it means to read the contemporary period through its aesthetic practices. The module will be co-taught by staff from the School of English, the School of Arts and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, with seminars alternating between the Canterbury campus and the ICA (London).The module has three main objectives. First, it will consider what it means, in a theoretical sense, to think about our contemporary moment. Second, it will address key themes and issues in contemporary culture and will consider how they bear on and are shaped by recent aesthetic forms. Third, through the seminars delivered at the ICA, which will arise directly out of the ICA's programme, students will be introduced to examples of current aesthetic practice.

   FI811 - Conceptualising Film


   
    Conceptualizing Film will provide students both with an in-depth examination of certain key issues in film theory, as well as approaching them (predominantly) from a distinct perspective associated with an emerging 'paradigm' of theory, namely analytic philosophy of film. The module will be organized around a series of sub-themes within the general domain of the philosophy of film, including emotion and film, the aesthetics and ethics of film, the nature of photographic and filmic representation, and the ways in which films might themselves act as vehicles for philosophical ideas. Throughout the course we will also consider the different styles of philosophy and their relationship to film theory. Seminars will stress the importance of examining arguments with care and rigour, and will introduce students explicitly to certain formal philosophical 'methods' of assessing arguments (eg. spotting question-begging, understanding distinctions such as that between entailment and implicature, the use of counterexamples and thought experiments). The ability to acquire and put to use such skills will be central in students achieving module objectives.

   FI812 - Advanced Film Theory


   
    This course examines the historical trajectory of systematic writing about film. Topics include the aesthetic strategies of film in contrast with other arts; films relationship with reality; the interdisciplinary reach of Film Studies; and the particular kinds of engagement into which cinema invites its audience.  As a goal, the course should help students understand the major theoretical debates, empower them to better informed analyses, and challenge their assumptions about what film canor shouldbe and do.

   FI813 - Film History


   
    This course examines film history and historiography through case study. In carrying out this investigation students will be encouraged to work with archive and primary sources held in the library in order to help them to evaluate and contest received histories, which may be based on an aesthetic, technological, economic, and/or social formations. Through this investigation students will be better able to understand the role and value of the contextual study of film, while giving them the opportunity to research and write on an aspect of film history. The choice of case study will depend upon the expertise of the module convenor and is not restricted to a particular national cinema or period.

   EN834 - Imagining India


   
    This course will trace the evolution of the images and perceptions surrounding the idea of India in British and Indian literature from the Mutiny of 1857 to the present day.  Through a variety of genres, including fiction, film and painting we will explore the ways in which representations of India became important sites of conflict, fantasy and dialogue between Indian and British writers in the late colonial period.  We will then go on to consider how these discourses were co-opted, questioned and re-visioned after Independence by successive generations of Indians negotiating the rapidly changing idea of the nation.  The course will be centred largely (but not exclusively) on works written in English and will question what it means to translate cultures, languages, and national vocabularies  what is lost and gained in the act of literary appropriation and exchange, and how history is shaped in the process.

   EN850 - Centres and Edges: Modernist and PostcolonialQuest Literature


   
    Challenging the common centre-margin paradigm at the heart of postcolonial discourse, this broad-ranging and comparative module traces interconnections between modernist and postcolonial literature of the quest from different cultural locations and conjunctions. Just as the knights of the Fisher King legend set out to find the Holy Grail, both the modern and postcolonial self embark on individual odysseys in quest for origin, identity and language. Whilst the modernists experimentation with form evidences the sickness of modernity, postcolonial quest literature offers a reaction to a national schizophrenia: quest for self echoes a quest for a country, a language and a history. Conrads Heart of Darkness (1902), an early example of how the imperialist divide and centre-margin dialectic are handled, will mark the beginning of our exploration of modernist grail quests for an effective medium of communication, existentialist quests in a modern world in crisis, experimental quests into the unknown and poetic quests crossing thresholds of meaning. Primary texts will be read alongside recent critical work from a variety of mythological, philosophical, anthropological and theoretical perspectives.

   EN852 - Colonial and Postcolonial Discourses


   
    This module introduces you to a wide range of colonial and postcolonial theoretical discourses. It focuses on the construction of the historical narrative of imperialism, psychology and culture of colonialism, nationalism and liberation struggles, and postcolonial theories of complicity and resistance. The module explores the benefits and problems derived from reading literature and culture by means of a postcolonial and postimperial lens. Through the study of crucial texts and events, both historical and current, the module analyses the birth of imperialist narratives and their complex consequences for the world today.

   EN857 - Body and Place in the Postcolonial Text


   
    This module involves a materialist analysis of the dynamics of colonialism and postcolonialism, while at the same time problematising the assumed distinction between body and mind, or spirit. It is divided into three sections. The first section explores ethnic conflict and racism in relation to caste and class in postcolonial Indian society. The second looks at the economic deployments of the body of the master and the body of the slave. The third section examines the pairing of land and freedom in North African and Palestinian contexts.

   EN872 - Provocations and Invitations


   
    This module introduces the challenges and pleasures of postmodern poetry and poetics. We will consider a range of poetic texts, and essays on poetry, that between them raise profound questions of nation, agency, language, politics and gender in the post-war period. Starting with Charles Olsons groundbreaking inquiries into open field poetics, we will investigate a range of American and British poets for whom the poem has been a way of generating new modes of thought and life. In particular we will explore the ways in which poetry of the period enables us to think through the implications of globalization. We will consider how poetry can escape the constraints of place, and how it can imagine new forms of collective identity. Among the poets we will consider are:  Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Frank OHara, Denise Riley, Lyn Hejinian, J. H. Prynne, and Tony Lopez. The work of these writers will be read alongside contemporary philosophy and political theory, and will be considered in relation to other art forms, especially painting. Students on the module will benefit from the activities of the Centre for Modern Poetry, including regular readings, research seminars and the reading groups.

   HA825 - Post-Conceptual Art and Visual Arts Criticism


   
    The construct of the post-conceptual in relation to visual arts practice has two principal inflexions. Firstly, it delineates a generation of contributors typically born in the 1960s and 1970s for whom the legacies of Modernism and conceptual art are cultural givens. Secondly, it situates a range of practice (including media art and digital platforms) in relation to expanded and evolving contexts of criticism, cultural consumption and curation.The proposed curriculum will follow recent visual arts-based critical responses to the development of particular genres and associated shifts in cultural production.  For example, this will include the attention given to emerging practices of self and group curation and the rationale for the doubling or multiplying of artistic agency variously demonstrated by collectives such as SUPERFLEX, Claire Fontaine and by a range of contemporary working partnerships. The module will explore how several recent critics have mobilised and applied ideas of the political to account for distinctive thematics within recent practice. Considering some of the recent distinctions noted by the art critic Claire Bishop, the module will evaluate different forms of sculpture and installation practice (immersive, site responsive, site independent and site specific) and how these mediate changing contexts and conditions of production and  spectatorship.

     HA826      - History and Theory of Curating


     
      This module will introduce you to the history and theory of curating through a series of detailed case studies from the early modern period to the present day. These will focus on how collections have been formed and maintained, the nature of key institutions in the art world like museums and galleries, and in particular it will examine the phenomenon of the exhibition. Different approaches to curating exhibitions will be examined, and the responsibilities of the curator towards artists, collections, and towards the public will be analysed. Broad themes in the theory of curating and museology will be examined. Wherever possible the case studies chosen will draw on the resources and expertise of partner organisations, such as Canterbury Museums and the Institute for Contemporary Art.

     EN897      - Advanced Critical Reading


     
      This module is designed to help you extend and develop your skill, enjoyment and confidence as a reader of critical and theoretical texts. We will reflect on the pleasures and challenges of the reading process as we work slowly through a single major essay. As we go we will focus on exciting, complex or important passages, taking time to follow up references and footnotes, identify important themes and ideas, consult works of art and writings that share those themes, explore what the essay means for us and how it goes about the game of thinking. The module is designed to help you come away with an in-depth knowledge of the essay and the texts and ideas surrounding it, and a deeper understanding of how you read. Our ten weekly seminars will function as a two-hour guided reading-group. Seminars will incorporate short student presentations introducing a particular passage, or otherwise focusing on issues raised by the main text or on relations between these issues, the main text and supplementary reading. Total study hours: 20 per week. Students will be assessed on a piece of written work of 5-6,000 words presented at the conclusion of the module on a topic agreed with the teacher.In 2015-16 the central text is 'Aphorism Countertime,' by Jacques Derrida.'Aphorism Countertime' was first published on the occasion of a new production of Romeo and Juliet in Paris in 1986. As well as finding out about about aphorisms, time and mistiming as Derrida's thinking frames them, we will read Shakespeare's play, study Freud on why we make mistakes, excerpts from the philosophy of Hegel and Husserl and discuss stories and films that explore timing, love, fate and near-misses. Aphorism: Any principle or precept expressed in few words; a short pithy sentence containing a truth of general import; a maxim.
