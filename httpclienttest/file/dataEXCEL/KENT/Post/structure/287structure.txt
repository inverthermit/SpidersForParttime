Course structure


 You can tailor your studies to your particular needs and interests to obtain an LLM or Diploma in a single specialisation, in two specialisations jointly, or by choosing a broad range of modules in different areas of law to obtain a general LLM or Diploma in Law.

As a student on the LLM at Canterbury, your choice of specialisation will be shaped by the modules you take and your dissertation topic. To be awarded an LLM in a single specialisation, at least three of your six modules must be chosen from those associated with that specialisation with your dissertation also focusing on that area of law. The other three modules can be chosen from any offered in the Law School. All students are also required to take the Legal Research and Writing Skills module. To be awarded a major/minor specialisation you will need to choose three modules associated with one specialisation, and three from another specialisation, with the dissertation determining which is your 'major' specialisation.

For example, a student who completes at least three modules in International Commercial Law and completes a dissertation in this area would graduate with an LLM in International Commercial Law; a student who completes three Criminal Justice modules and three Environmental Law modules and then undertakes a dissertation which engages with Criminal Justice would graduate with an LLM in Criminal Justice and Environmental Law.

   LW801 - Intellectual Property


   
    Over the past few decades, the scope of intellectual property has grown significantly. The goal of the module is to provide an overview of these areas from different angles in order to be able to assess this expansion. In so doing, it will examine this area of law from historical, theoretical and practical perspectives. The emphasis throughout the module is on reflexive critique. That is, we will study the different modes of justifying intellectual property; the different historical approaches to trace the ways in which we can understand the political economy of intellectual property and we will look at the past to try to find ways of thinking about the present situation of international legal regimes. On a more contemporary level, we will study the interaction between intellectual property and health, the problems posed by biotechnology, as well as the more practical question on the way of producing evidence in intellectual property trials. No prior knowledge or study of intellectual property is required.

   LW844 - Legal Aspects of Contemporary International Problems


   
    There are a number of ways to approach the field of international law. It can be treated doctrinally as a system of rules from various sources  such as treaties, state practices that are seen to have the binding force of law, and general principles shared across domestic jurisdictions  built up over time to regulate interactions between states and other entities. It can be studied as a historical phenomenon, emerging from out of a colonial history with contemporary implications. It can also be studied as an (imperfect) approach to addressing international 'problems', placing international law in broader social, political, and historical contexts as one possible source of 'solutions'. This course highlights international laws limits and possibilities in relation to a set of contemporary inter- and trans-national concerns, including the use of armed force, responses to emerging security threats, and unresolved territorial disputes. It focuses on key themes of international law, such as sovereignty, statehood, self-determination, and the regulation of armed conflict, drawing upon perspectives from the humanities and the interpretive social sciences. It explores these overlapping themes as they emerge across several issues and case studies, bringing international law into a relationship with contemporary geopolitics, political theory, and the fields historical inheritance. Along the way, we will address philosophical and theoretical questions such as the binding character of international law, problems of representation and interpretation, and the rhetorical dimensions of customary international law. Topics covered The topics covered vary year to year to align with changing circumstances and also according to student interest, but are anticipated to be as follows:- The use of force and the law of armed conflict - Reframing sovereignty: the responsibility to protect- Regulating the global arms trade- Targeted killing- Enforcing the prohibition against torture- Border conflicts and colonial legacies in international law

   LW847 - World Trade Organisation (WTO) Law and Practice I


   
    The establishment of the WTO on 1 January 1995 has signalled the beginning of a new era in international economic relations. Unlike the GATT, whose main purpose was the reduction of barriers on trade in goods, the WTO legal regime reach deeper into more areas of policy-making, ranging from the regulation of services and investments to the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, through its Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) the WTO has the capacity to generate case-law on the resolution of disputes under the WTO agreements that it covers. This marks a significant shift from the earlier GATT dispute settlement mechanism as it creates, for the first time on the multilateral level, a binding decision-making apparatus. Thus any serious attempt to understand the nature and development of international economic law requires a careful and detailed study of the WTO and its law and practice. It is the cornerstone of the new global economic order. This module offers a comprehensive overview of this evolving legal and regulatory order.Topics covered1.  Theoretical and Political Approaches to International Economic Regulation of Trade; the main actors: states, multinational enterprises, civil society and NGOs2.  Free Trade Theory and Practice3.  The Institutional Context: the Bretton Woods System, the GATT and the WTO4.  The WTO and developing countries: GATT preferences and WTO Special and   Differential Treatment5.  The Dispute Settlement Understanding6.  Trade in Agriculture7.  Trade in Services8.  Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights9.  The rise of 'mega-market' trade agreements10.  Alternative trade arrangements

   LW927 - Law and the Humanities 1: Ethos and Scholarship (Intensive Delivery)


   
    This module provides students with a solid grounding in law and the humanities, a distinct approach to law that draws upon disciplines like political theory, literature, film studies, history and social theory. The module familiarises students with key questions in the field, provides training in humanities methods in relation to law, and equips students with a clear and rigorous approach to all their present and future academic work. No special knowledge or experience of any particular discipline is required to undertake the module. The module is organized around three main questions; Part one interrogates what is distinctive about law and humanities research methodology by considering the relation between the scholar and their object of study. We ask how the humanities consider this problem, with attention to the special case of law and the legal tradition. Students will find this helpful in thinking through their own relationship with topics of interest in their research.Part two will consider the notion of "critical" scholarship, by asking the question of what legal scholarship can do, or what it is for. Students will have the opportunity to reflect on critical scholarship's function in relation to key questions of politics, ethics, and justice. Part three takes up the theme of responsibility. What options does current scholarship offer for thinking about the responsibility of the scholar? Can humanities-based approaches to law offer a distinctive answer to the question of the scholar's responsibility, or to whom (or what) they might be responsible?Considering law in relation to the textual tradition broadly understood, this module emphasizes the skills of reading, critical analysis, writing and argument-making across a range of different texts, cultural media, and legal questions. There will be a practical focus on producing well-crafted and supported arguments. The module will help students to develop an incisive paradigm for their dissertation in the final stage of their masters programme, whatever its disciplinary orientation might be. Where possible, the module will encourage students who are interested in further academic study to produce assessment that could be shaped for publication with a suitable journal in the field of law and the humanities.

     LW923      - Economic Sociology of Law


     
      What causes us to forget that 'the economy' and 'the law' are made up of interacting human beings? Why does it matter? These are questions that are relevant to every person in every country. They are the questions that motivate the emergent field of Economic Sociology of Law (ESL), which takes sociologically-inspired approaches to relationships between the 'economic' (the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services) and the legal (the use, abuse and avoidance of legal rules and institutions). In this module we systematically (that is, addressing the analytical, empirical and normative components) explore the limitations of orthodox legal and economic approaches, and examine how Economic Sociology of Law might compensate for them. There is a strong practical and empirical emphasis, and examples are drawn from current events and policy from all over the world. Questions considered include:  Where do the concepts of economy, law and society come from? What do they signify? Are they uniformly accepted? Mutually exclusive? What are the substantive focus of legal, sociological and economic approaches to law and economy? How do these disciplines (conceptually and empirically) approach legal rules, institutions and practices? Why  in pursuit of what values and interests  is it useful to take any of these approaches to law?Emphasis is likely to be placed on the property rights and transaction costs, formality and informality, markets and market failure, state intervention and regulation and corruption.

     LW839      - Environmental Quality Law


     
      This module provides an introduction to the law on environmental quality and a preface to regulatory themes that are pursued in other environmental modules. In common language, the module is about the law relating to 'pollution', but, as will be seen, this is a concept that is quite difficult to define with the precision that is needed as a basis for legal rights and duties. 'Environmental quality' is a broader term, encompassing issues as to the degree of contamination that is considered acceptable in relation to the three environmental media of water, air and land. Broadly, the module is organised around the progression of approaches that law has taken towards the regulation of those activities that have been identified as most damaging to the environmental media. Although, this involves careful examination and evaluation of national laws relating to pollution control, attention is increasingly focused upon regulatory requirements drawn from European Union and international law. The module seeks to assess different models and strategies for environmental quality regulation against broader objectives for the environment in reflecting upon what it is that is to be regulated, and why, and whether actual approaches to regulation are the best way of achieving this.  Topics coveredSession 1: Objectives of environmental quality lawSession 2: Environmental quality and private rights Session 3: Environmental liability and environmental human rightsSession 4: Water quality regulationSession 5: Air quality law Session 6: Waste management lawSession 7: The Integration of pollution controlSession 8: Enforcement and the Environment Agency

      This module provides a detailed study of the history, rules, doctrines and institutions of public international law. It offers a critical analysis of the international legal order and a firm basis upon which to found arguments concerning the political importance of international law. The module pays special attention to the way in which the evolution and operation of the international legal order influence not only international relations, but also daily domestic life.At the end of the course students will be able to assess, both internally and in context, the main the rules, doctrines and institutions of public international law. Students will also develop the necessary tools to reflect critically on some of the most important problems and tensions that define the contemporary global order: from calamities resulting from war, international interventions and surveillance strategies in countries like Afghanistan, Libya and Pakistan, to the everyday effects of increasing socio-economic disparities and environmental decay in both the Global South and the Global North. The teaching, discussions and readings in the module will equip students both with a doctrinal understanding of public international law, and with an approach to the field that is grounded in a Critical, Socio-Legal and Law and Humanities perspective.

     LW905      - International Financial Services Regulation


     
      This module is about the regulatory regimes that govern financial sectors of the economy. It focuses on the very recent history of regulation in this field and it examines domestic and international aspects of how states and societies enact and perform regulation of financial firms and transactions. The module is built around three inter-related elements:  Development of the New International Financial Architecture (NIFA), a set of institutions, standards and processes that have been established during the last ten years to increase the stability of financial sectors globally, particularly in the so-called "emerging economies", and to expand markets for the services and products of financial firms. This element of the module will entail study of (a) the construction of economic crises of the 1990s as a threat to the global economic order; (b) the creation of new international groupings and institutions, (eg., the Financial Stability Forum and the G-20) and new roles for older institutions (e.g. surveillance by the IMF and the World Bank Group through the Financial System Assessment Program) to address the threat, (c) regulatory technique in the international arena, including standard setting, harmonization and compliance, and other dimensions of governance through soft law.  Relationships between the NIFA and the changing modes of governing domestic financial sectors: This element of the module will entail study of (a) the emergence of integrated financial sector regulators in many jurisdictions; (b) interaction between the domestic / regional and the international spheres in response to concerns about financial instability, risk and 'contagion'. (Relevant responses include implementation of Basel II, the Lender of Last Resort, and the development of international standards of insurance supervision); and (c) comparative analysis of the market governance regimes established by integrated regulators in terms of their capacities to protect domestic consumers of financial services.   Critical analysis of scholarly and policy literature on regulation of the financial sectors. This element of the module will entail reflective assessment of how authors of literature on financial sector regulation execute the craft of research by reference to factors such as linkages to relevant literatures, originality of authors' claims, strength of argument and analysis of data.

     LW837      - Conservation and Natural Resources Law


     
      The conservation and sustainable use of living natural resources or biodiversity represents a key element in securing the overarching environmental policy objective of sustainable development.  Globally, the protection of the world's endangered species, habitats and ecosystems is becoming an ever more urgent task.  The module traces the historical progression from approaches based on property rights, welfare based legislation to more genuinely conservation oriented laws.  From early national legislation concerned with the direct protection of wildlife and the protection of ecologically important habitats the module turns to look at ecological law from broader European Union and global international perspectives.  Discussions of the EU Wild Birds and Habitats Directives, and the Biodiversity Convention  are used to illustrate some of the key legal features in biodiversity conservation law.  Concluding sessions examine the international trade dimension of conservation law and the protection of fishery resources.  The module explores some of the challenges of regulating and managing dynamic ecosystems and the implications of regulation for landholders and those engaged in wildlife exploitation.  Topics Covered The Legal Status of Natural Resources  The Direct Protection of Species and Institutional Responsibilities The Protection of Habitats The European Union Wild Birds Directive The European Union Habitats Directive Implementation of European Union Conservation Legislation International Trade and Nature Conservation The Tragedy of the Commons: Fisheries Resources

     LW838      - Land Development Law


     
      The regulation of land development and land use is a key element in the legal response to the need to protect the environment and to secure broader environmental policy objectives such as sustainable development and the enhancement of biodiversity.  Development places perhaps the greatest stress on natural resources and environmental quality. In many legal systems the decision to grant development consent is critical. This module considers the role of strategic and specific planning controls in preventing and mitigating environmental harm.  This module provides discussion of private law forms of land use control and of current debates in property law about restraining owners' rights because of social constraints such as environmental protection, and also the impact of human rights laws which seek to protect property rights from undue state interference. There is a strong emphasis on those legal forms which are found both internationally and across jurisdictions, in particular environmental assessment.  Particular attention is given to the European Union Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive, and the difficulties in implementing these that have arisen in the member states.  Topics Covered Private Control of Land Development  Public Law Origins of Land Use Regulation Land Development and Human Rights Development Planning  Development Control  Planning Conditions and Obligations  The EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive  Implementation of Environmental Impact Assessment  The EU Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive

     LW907      - Commercial Credit


     
      Credit and financing are the lifeblood of capitalism. Commercial credit and the taking of security is an area of law that is of significant economic and social importance in developed and developing economies. The most recent world financial crisis was triggered by failures in debt markets associated with household financing. This module explores central ideas about the role of commercial financing in the economy, its contribution to economic development, different international approaches to legal regulation, international competition between models and the role of legal transplantation.We focus initially in this module on the economic and social role of commercial credit law, its role in economic development and international initiatives to promote reform and harmonisation. The module then considers the central role of security in commercial credit and discusses both English and North American approaches to the regulation of security interests and their treatment in insolvency. The module highlights the fundamental ideas, principles and policies in these contrasting systems. The module then considers the role of Islamic Finance and outlines its basic principles and assumptions and structures of financing. It considers finally the role of microfinance as a case study of the role of credit in development.

      This module is designed to examine and assess selected substantive legal aspects of International Environmental Law.  For this purpose, the module is divided into two main parts. The first part considers particular sectors of environmental policy that are the subject of international legal regulation and obligations. This will involve an appraisal of how international legal regulation has developed in these areas, taking into account various challenges, legal and political, that have been influential in shaping their respective evolution. The second part of the module focuses on selected legal topics concerning the implementation of international environmental law.  In particular, it will consider various relatively recent developments in international environmental that have served to broaden out participation beyond the level of the nation state as regards the monitoring and enforcement of international environmental protection obligations. Topics covered The module will cover a range of substantive legal aspects of international environmental law (the list of topics may change over time to accommodate legal developments and/or teaching and learning considerations). Indicatively, the module may be expected to cover all/some of the following topic areas: A. Selected substantive sectors of International Environmental Law Atmospheric pollution (1): Air pollution Atmospheric pollution (2): Climate change  Water (1) : marine environment Water (2): freshwater resources Waste management B.

     LW888      - Climate Change and Renewable Energy Law


     
      This module examines a range of topics relating to the legal regulation of anthropogenic climate change and the promotion of renewable and other alternative forms of energy generation and conservation.While the module requires introductory coverage of the international context, and explores some of the specific ethical and policy questions that tackling climate change engages, the module does not cover those aspects of the international legal regulation of climate change that are covered in LW906 International Environmental Law: Legal Foundations or any coverage that there may be in LW884 International Environmental Law: Substantive Legal Aspects. The focus is on the EU and national level, and comparative analysis.Topics covered Climate Change as a Policy Problem: the International Law and Policy Context EU Climate Change I: an Overview of the Law and Policy of the EU EU Climate Change II: Controlling Emissions through Traditional Regulatory Forms EU Climate Change III: The EU Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme and comparative economic incentive approaches UK Climate Change I: Legal Obligations under the UK Climate Change Act 2008 UK Climate Change II: The Institutional Dimension: the UK Committee on Climate Change Comparative Climate Change Reduction Duties and Proposals: Canada as a case study Carbon Capture and Sequestration: International, EU and national legal Issues Flexibility mechanisms Climate Change Litigation: Liability mechanisms in comparative perspective Promoting Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation: General Legal and Policy Issues, and case study

     LW899      - Corporate Governance


     
      In recent years corporate governance - meaning the governance of the large corporations which dominate modern economic life - has emerged as a major area of political and academic interest. Increasing attention has come to be focused, in particular, on the comparative aspects of corporate governance and on the different legal regimes found in different parts of the world, with policy makers striving to determine which regimes are most likely to deliver (so-called) `efficiency' and competitive success. In this context much has been made of the differences between shareholder-oriented, Anglo-American governance regimes and the more inclusive (more stakeholder-oriented) regimes to be found in certain parts of continental Europe and Japan. One result is that the increasing interest in corporate governance has re-opened old questions about the nature of corporations, about the role and duties of corporate managers and about the goal of corporate activities and the interests in which corporations should be run.This module will explore these debates. More generally, the question of corporate governance has become entangled with other important debates, most notably that surrounding the merits (or otherwise) of different models of capitalism: Anglo-American regimes are associated with stock market-based versions of capitalism, while European regimes are associated with so-called welfare-based versions of capitalism.The question of corporate governance has, therefore, become embroiled with debates about the morality and efficiency of different models of capitalism. These too will be explored in this module.

     LW843      - International Human Rights Law


     
      This module is designed to enable postgraduate students to obtain both essential knowledge of and critical insight into, issues relating to international human rights law. Human rights occupy an extremely important place in contemporary discussions about law, justice and politics at both the domestic and the international level. Across all spheres of government, bodies of law and, pretty much, in every single social mobilization, human rights are invoked and debated. This module approaches the key place occupied by human rights in the contemporary world from an international perspective. The module aims to link the international origins of human rights and the main human rights systems, with the actual practice of human rights. Particular attention is paid in the module to the value, as well as the limits of human rights when they approach, or try to address the problems and the aspirations of five important 'subjects': the Citizen, the Refugee, the Cultural Subject, the Woman and the Poor.The module is organized around lectures and seminars delivered by the convenor, as well as lectures given by invited guests speaker. Guest speakers will explore in their lectures how they have approached in their research and practice the five 'subjects' mentioned above (ie, the Citizen, the Refugee, the Cultural Subject, the Women and the Poor). Emphasis is placed on maximum student participation during seminar discussions for which students will need to prepare. Students are encouraged to develop a critical perspective in light of historical and socio-economic backgrounds.Similar to the module public international law, the teaching, discussions and readings in the module will equip students both with a doctrinal understanding of international human rights law, and with an approach to the field that is grounded in a Critical, Socio-Legal and Law and Humanities perspective.

     LW916      - European Union International Relations Law


     
      This module explores the external relations law of the European Union with third countries and international organisations. This is an increasingly important area given that the EU has evolved into the largest regional trading and political bloc on the world stage. Having focused initially on developing a common trading policy with the international community, since the early 1990s the EU has steadily broadened the range of its powers to be able to engage in political as well as military issues on the international scene. A significant milestone was the formal establishment of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. More recently, the Lisbon Treaty 2007 further enhanced the EU's role in foreign affairs through a series of institutional changes and innovations, notably including the introduction of the 'External Action Service', which is the EU counterpart to national diplomatic services, and the Unions High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The module will critically explore the following aspects in particular:  1. The institutional and core legal framework of EU external relations law, including the division of competences between the EU and the Member States, the impact of human rights in EU external relations and the expansion of the EU powers over time;2. Selected specific policy areas, such as the Common Commercial Policy, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the external dimension to EU environmental policy, along with their different (and sometimes conflicting) objectives and underlying political perspectives. The module will also foster a contextual, interdisciplinary and critical approach to studying the subject, with reference to political science literature on the effects of EU external policies.

     LW918      - International and Comparative Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law & Policy


     
      Bankruptcy and Insolvency law has become a central aspect of commercial law. The restructuring of capitalism since the 1970s, the growth of neo-liberalism, the increased use of debt financing by both firms and individuals, and the volatility of the international economy have contributed to its international importance. The World Bank views a 'modern' insolvency law as central to the development infrastructure, it is linked to fostering entrepreneurialism as well as providing a safety net for individuals in a high debt economy. This course provides a critical introduction to central issues in business and personal insolvency. Topics covered1. Theories of insolvency law.  2. The English model: Central issues in insolvency law: The role of secured credit in bankruptcy law. Liquidation and reorganization.3. The North American model: Chapter 114. Personal Insolvency5. Cross-border and international insolvency6. The future of bankruptcy in an age of austerity

     LW925      - Cultural Heritage Law


     
      Cultural heritage law has developed as a distinctive legal topic in the last thirty years to regulate the widening concept of heritage which started with the protection of historical monuments in the 19th century and now includes intangible values.This area of law considers a developing jurisprudence that involves international treaties, laws, ethics, and policy consideration relating to the heritage. Academic research now aims to identify values and principles that contribute to a fair and equitable cultural heritage policy. It addresses the essential question of the need to change the law to accommodate the specific needs of protection of cultural heritage/cultural property. It aims to give coherence to practices shaped by art dealers, collectors, museums, communities and States, as well as a complex body of rules at the intersection of civil law, property law, criminal law, public law, private international law and public international law. Those different interactions have developed a less than coherent legal framework that will be comparatively analyzed by reference to French, English and American Law.The different topics studies include (but are not limited to): The origins of cultural property and the definitions of cultural heritage  The development of a national and international framework of cultural heritage law (with an emphasis on the role of the European Union and of UNESCO), including the protection of cultural heritage in time of war as well as the international trade of cultural property in time of peace (private international law and International conventions on the transfer of ownership of stolen art and illegally exported items) Dealing with the past: the reversal of historic wrongs (including human remains and World War II spoliation)  The role of Alternative Dispute Resolution in cultural heritage disputes The role of the State and of Museums in the creation/implementation of cultural policies

     LW922      - Labour Rights in a Global Economy


     
      The 'new global economy' (global integration of production and increased migration, digital and informational technologies, transformations in work and production processes, the shift to services, and the informalisation of work) has undermined the pillars upon which labour law was constructed after World War II in developed capitalist economies.  Moreover, contrary to expectation, informal work has not diminished in emerging and developing economies, and has, in fact, increased. In this context, a new strategy for achieving labour standards and protecting workers has emerged. Labour rights are now conceptualised as a species of human rights and they are asserted before various international, transnational, and domestic human rights bodies and courts. The focus of this module will be on international and transnational norms and institutions, and their interaction with national/domestic labour regimes.  We will consider changing forms (from labour standard to labour rights and hard to soft law) and scales (national to transnational and international) of regulation, the changing 'subjects' of labour law (women, migrant workers, 'solo' self-employed), and the changing goals of labour law (flexibility and competiveness versus security and protection). Labour rights will be placed in their social, economic, and political context.

     LW811      - International Commercial Arbitration


     
      The aim of the module is to focus on the theoretical, institutional and practical aspects of modern international commercial arbitration. This would involve a close examination of the ad hoc systems and the main institutional structures (eg, ICC, ICSID, WIPO, Iran-US Claims Tribunal, and PCA). The module covers current issues and developments relating to international commercial arbitration including: arbitral jurisdiction; applicable procedural and substantive laws; the status and role of arbitration agreements; the conduct of arbitral proceedings; the arbitral award; challenge, recognition and enforcement of award; and online arbitration/online dispute resolution (ODR). The English Arbitration Act 1996 and the UNCITRAL Rules as well as the UNCITRAL Model Law will be examined closely. The course will also critically examine the relationship between international commercial arbitration and international development law as well as aspects of the international commercial arbitration concerning sovereign states in oil and gas disputes. Comparative study will be made of the emerging commercial arbitration legislation and international arbitral practice of certain developing states such as Nigeria, India and China. The course also aims to provide an appreciation of the similarities and contrasts between the work of international arbitral institutions and the work of international courts such as the International Court of Justice in commercial and economic matters.Topics covered The Concept of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and International Commercial Arbitration The Applicable Procedural and Substantive Law of Arbitration/ Arbitration Clauses and Submission Agreements Arbitration in the resolution of Oil and Gas and Energy Disputes Establishment and Organization of Arbitral Tribunal Powers, Duties and Jurisdiction of an Arbitral Tribunal Public Policy in International Commercial Arbitration Trends and Developments in the International Arbitral and Adjudicatory Practice of Energy Disputes   The Arbitral Award and Its Drafting

     LW813      - Contemporary Topics in Intellectual Property Law


     
      This module introduces in detail some of the most acute and pressing current problems in intellectual property, such as copyright and piracy in visual arts and music, justification for patents and their effects on scientific knowledge production, and the effects of logos and brands in capitalist symbolic economy. Steering away from often crudely conducted debates, this course aims to provide students with a deep and nuanced understanding of legal internal ways of thinking about intellectual property by introducing them to wider theoretical debates in humanities and social sciences about intellectual properties. The aim is to enable students to form a differentiated assessment of intellectual property law's effects and limitations. Topics to be explored may include:- What is original?  Does quoting or paraphrasing in literature or art amount to copying?  Does free knowledge go hand in hand with precarious labour in knowledge industries? What are the modes of intellectual credit? Are there other forms of credit than property? What is the 'intellectual' in intellectual properties?  How do you draw contours around intangible knowledge?  Can nature be patented? Do patents turn human persons into things? Is enforcing patents on pharmaceuticals in developing countries just?  Do trademarks commodify language?Readings will be drawn from the multi-disciplinary scholarship on intellectual properties, including anthropology, history, science studies, economics and social theory.Prior attendance of LW 801 Intellectual Property Law in autumn term is welcome, but not a prerequisite. No prior knowledge of study of patent, copyright or trademarks law is required. Interested students from various disciplines are welcome, subject to prior agreement.

     LW928      - Law and the Humanities 2: Current Issues (Intensive Delivery)


     
      This module presents students with a selection of the most important contemporary debates in the field of law and the humanities. Drawing in any one year from a range of current issues in the field, the module addresses a larger set of themes situated at the intersection between the humanities and law. These themes include: textuality, performativity, representation, memory, iconography, tradition, the archive, rhetoric, aesthetics, and affect. The module therefore encourages a deeper understanding of law's relationship to humanities disciplines such as literature, visual culture, history, language, and political and social theory.In synthesizing the intellectual heritage of law's traditions, institutions and pragmatics with the theoretical and methodological richness of the humanities, the module provides students with both a critical appreciation of the impact of humanities scholarship on law and a clear sense of what the study of law contributes to the humanities. By emphasizing this cross-fertilisation, the module strengthens students intellectual, analytical, critical and imaginative capabilities, whilst cultivating specific learning skills including critical reading, effective writing and argument-development. This training will help students to create an effective framework for their final dissertation, whatever its disciplinary orientation. Where possible, the module will encourage students who are interested in further academic study to produce assessment that could be shaped for publication with a suitable journal in the field of law and the humanities. The module provides an intellectual space in which students will become acquainted with a range of theoretical perspectives and methodologies, and nurtures a more rigorous approach to their present and future academic engagement and research. However, no special knowledge or experience of any particular discipline is required in order to take this module.
