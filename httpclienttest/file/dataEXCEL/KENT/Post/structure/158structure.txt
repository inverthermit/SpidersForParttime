   SP827 - Current Issues in Cognitive Psychology and Neuropsychology


   
    The aim of this core module is to provide a coherent base for understanding the methodological and option modules, each of the latter outlining a major area of concern in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology (vision, learning, memory, language, reasoning, emotion). The relationship between brain and mind, the modularity of brain and mind, and the notion of different levels/frameworks of description and explanation will be discussed. Finally, the principled use of cross-domain constraint satisfaction as an essential heuristic will be critically analysed.Completion of this module should enable students to critically appraise the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of the various disciplines that comprise cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, and to evaluate how these disciplines may successfully be combined to further scientific understanding of the core problems in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology today.The aim of this core module is to provide a coherent base for understanding the methodological and option modules, each of the latter outlining a major area of concern in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology (vision, learning, memory, language, reasoning, emotion).

   SP998 - Advanced Research Project in Psychology


   
    All students undertake a supervised empirical research project in an area of psychology relevant to their chosen MSc programme, and submit it as a typed dissertation of 8,000-10,000 words. The aim of the dissertation is to test the student's ability to plan, execute, analyse, and report a piece of independent research in the relevant setting. The dissertation requires detailed theoretical knowledge of the discipline, an appreciation of the ways in which that knowledge has been applied in previous research and practice, and the methodological and statistical skills to set up a scientific investigation. Supervision is provided by the principal teaching staff and by other appropriate staff with research interests in a student's chosen area. Students are advised to read the School's Ethics pages for information on submitting applications for ethical approval to the School and to relevant outside bodies.Timetable: Students are encouraged to approach potential supervisors early to discuss possible topics for research. A research proposal is written and agreed with the supervisor in the Autumn Term. An ethical application is also submitted to the School's Research Ethics Panel and outside ethics committees if appropriate. The research is conducted in the Spring and Summer Terms. The deadline for submission of dissertations is in August.

   SP850 - Advanced Cognitive (Neuroscience) Methods in Practice


   
    This module will provide students with theoretical instruction and practical experience in some key advanced research methods appropriate for scientific research in cognitive (neuro)psychology. The study of cognitive processes and the temporal nature of brain activity will feature highly in this module. The lectures will introduce key cognitive research methods (i.e. behavioural reaction times, eye-movements analysis and event-related brain potentials) and discuss relevant theory, experimental design and analysis. Lab-based practical sessions will be interspersed throughout the course to allow students to gain hands-on experience with using these research methods. This practical experience will enable them to generate concise plans for their own research activity and to develop critical thinking when evaluating others research.This module provides theoretical instruction and practical experience in some key advanced research methods appropriate for scientific research in cognitive (neuro)psychology.

   SP851 - Advanced Topics in Cognitive Development


   
    This module explores the typical development of key cognitive functions and the psychological methods employed to study these developments.  The aim of the module is to explore these topics at an advanced level, allowing students to evaluate critically pieces of research in terms of their findings, conceptual underpinnings, and/or methodological approaches.  Topics covered in the module usually include, among others: the development of executive functioning; the development of theory of mind; language and reading development; sensory development; methods for measuring cognition in preverbal populations; methods for measuring cognition in childhood; critical periods of development and neurological plasticity.

   SP854 - Advanced Topics in Developmental Psychopathology


   
    The study of developmental psychopathology aims to understand and elucidate the behavioural manifestations of developmental disorders, as well as the cognitive, neurobiological, and etiological bases of those behavioural manifestations.  In so doing, the study also has implications for our understanding of typical development, because it provides the opportunity to address questions about the extent to which behaviour and its underpinnings are, for example, innate versus learned and domain-specific versus domain-general. This module aims to provide you with a strong understanding of theories of prevalent developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment) and the methods used to investigate them.  You will be encouraged to critically evaluate these theories and methods, and to develop a wider awareness of how the study of developmental psychopathology is relevant to our understanding of typical development.  You will also learn directly from practitioners about the challenges faced working with people with developmental disorders and the techniques employed to support them.
