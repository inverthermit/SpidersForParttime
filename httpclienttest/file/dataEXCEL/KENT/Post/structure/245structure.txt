Course structure


 This programme is taught jointly with the School of Computing. Both schools are at the forefront of research in their areas. 

The School of Engineering and Digital Arts has an excellent reputation for research in various aspects of biometrics, including individual biometric modalities, the management of complexity in biometric systems and the testing and evaluation of biometric systems; while the School of Computing has participated in the development of X.509 international standard and the first X.509 privilege management infrastructure (PMI) was built by members of this school.

This Master's programme offers an advanced level of learning by providing students with a thorough understanding of the theories, concepts and techniques for the design, development and effective use of secure information systems, and producing graduates who are capable of adapting to changes in the field and leading it in innovation.

The course is designed for practitioners, professionals and graduates with an interest in information security, access control technologies, and application domains using biometric identification and verification systems.

 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   CO834 - Trust, Security and Privacy Management


   
    This module investigates the whole process of security management. A holistic view of security management is taken, starting with risk management and the formulation of security policies. Technical subjects include a description of the various security models, and showing how authorisation policies can be automatically enforced. The legal and privacy issues associated with information management are also addressed, as are the usability issues of security technologies. Finally, the module concludes by investigating how security has already been inbuilt into some existing applications, and how security issues will effect the uptake of ubiquitous computing systems
