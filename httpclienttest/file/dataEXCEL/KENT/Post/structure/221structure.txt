Course structure


 The Economics and Finance MSc is studied over one year full-time or two years part-time and is divided into two stages: eight taught modules (six of which are compulsory) and a dissertation.

There are compulosry  modules in Financial Economics: Capital Market Instruments, Financial Economics and Asset Pricing, Advanced Macroeconomics, Econometric Methods, Time Series Econometrics and Research Methods. These  modules build upon students&rsquo; existing knowledge, understanding and skills.

Students develop a deeper understanding of economic and finance theory, quantitative and research methods, and policy applications. The teaching and learning of skills are carefully integrated into the structure of the modules and degree programme. The final two  modules are chosen from a range of options based upon the finance research interests of our academic staff.

All of our MSc programmes require some mathematical analysis, and we recognise that students have widely differing backgrounds in mathematics. The first week of all our MSc programmes includes compulsory intensive teaching in mathematics, refreshing and improving your skills in order to equip you with the techniques you will need for the rest of the programme.

Students who successfully pass the taught element of the programme proceed to the dissertation stage where you undertake a supervised project of your choice on an Economics/Finance topic.

Advice on choice of dissertation topic and management is given during the taught stage of the programme. The dissertation stage develops students&rsquo; research skills and follows on from the Research Methods module. Student dissertations are supervised by academic staff.




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   EC817 - Research Methods


   
    The aim of this module is to introduce you to a range of research methods and sources available in modern economics, and enable you to gain an understanding of their application in the context of your own MSc dissertation topic. In more practical terms, this module deals with the practicalities of postgraduate level research: acquiring and reviewing basic analytical skills, choosing a dissertation topic, deriving interesting and well-focused research questions, addressing questions with data or theory,  and interpreting and writing up results. It aims to ease the transition of students who merely learn about existing research to being researchers working on their MSc dissertations. The module is taught by various members of the School and as such will expose you to some topics we work on and the methodologies we use. It has two components. The first focuses on specific skills: mathematical skills, use of library resources, writing skills, and data collection and management. The second aims to prepare you for the dissertation stage by giving you some concrete help and feedback in choosing a research topic and planning your work.

   EC820 - Time Series Econometrics


   
    The module offers a research-oriented introduction to contemporary empirical macroeconomics by linking macroeconometric theory to empirical studies of the macroeconomy. The course looks at the models and methods used in central banks and research institutions for the policy analysis and forecasting. It integrates empirical illustrations through the use of computer based exercises with macroeconomic data using (for example) PcGive and PcGets, widely used statistical packages providing many of the statistical tools for the analysis of macroeconomic time series.The specific topics dealt with are: Stochastic processes; Linear and nonlinear time series models; Trend and cycle decompositions; Macroeconomic forecasting; Dynamic econometric models; Vector autoregressions and Cointegration;  Structural analysis.

   EC821 - Econometric Methods


   
    This module aims to study basic single equation econometric techniques in an intuitive and practical way to develop your understanding and ability to apply econometric methods.You will develop an understanding of the conventional linear regression model and the problems associated with the application of regression methods to economic modelling. The module is concerned with the application of econometric methods, with little emphasis on the mathematical aspects of the subject (which may be studied in other modules). The microcomputer software package STATA is used for practical work throughout this module, both as a means of providing realistic applications of the theory developed in lectures and to give you experience in the use of such software as a preparation for your own empirical research.No previous knowledge of computing or econometrics is required.

   EC824 - Financial Economics and Asset Pricing


   
    The module will develop your skills in asset pricing and understanding of its theoretical basis, while emphasising practical training in asset pricing. The two main topics in the module are investors utility maximisation and arbitrage theory in derivative pricing. The module discusses the arbitrage theory in both discrete and continuous time, and also briefly discusses the applications of option theory to business and real life situations. Although the module is mathematically challenging for most students, it aims to offer practical training. Indeed, the module puts stress on the intuitions and heuristics behind theorems and formulae, rather than their rigorous derivations and semantic definitions. Importantly, students are not only expected to understand theories but also expected to master how to use them.

   EC805 - Advanced Macroeconomics I


   
    This module is the core macroeconomic theory module in the MSc programmes in the School of Economics. The first part of the course deals with the microeconomic foundations of macroeconomics. The second part deals with short-term fluctuations in macroeconomic performance and how macroeconomic policy may be used to address these. The third  part  deals with a fundamental measure of long-term macroeconomic performance, economic growth.

   EC822 - Financial Economics: Capital Market Instruments


   
    This module on financial markets and instruments emphasises practical knowledge and analytical techniques. Specifically, it focuses on the structure of each financial market (such as the trading volume and investors in it), recommended investment strategies for specific types of investors, and market conventions. Also, several useful mathematical skills are explained.The module first introduces key principles, such as discounting, diversification, no arbitrage and hedging, and then discusses each asset class, such as bonds, equities and their derivatives (instruments), emphasising the general idea behind them. Although different types of assets require different methods of valuations and risk control, the basic principles are common to all asset classes. The module also covers asset liability management (ALM) and other related topics.

   EC815 - Growth and Development Theory


   
    Some of the greatest and most important books written in economics have been about the progress of nations. Some of the most distinguished economists in the world are development economists concerned with the economic progress of developing countries. Why are some countries rich and others poor? Why do some countries grow faster than others, and why have some countries got left behind? This graduate module, Growth and Development Theory,  introduces you to  theories  of growth and development  both old and new  looking at the various influential models that have been propounded over the years from Adam Smith and other classical economists in the 18th and 19th centuries to new endogenous growth theory in the modern era. As well as aggregate models associated with the names of Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Harrod, Solow, and the new growth theorists (Barro, Romer), there are also sectoral models emphasising the role of particular factors of production or sectors of the economy, such as Arthur Lewiss famous model of economic development with unlimited supplies of labour, and Nicholas Kaldors stress on the role of manufacturing industry based on increasing returns. We also look at centre-periphery models of growth and development associated with Gunnar Myrdal and Raul Prebisch, and constraints on growth imposed by the balance of payments and inflation.

   EC816 - International Finance


   
    This module is designed to introduce you to the main theoretical and empirical models of international financial relations. Exchange rates, capital flows, financial crises, current account and debt dynamics, and uncertainty are the most widely debated economic topics in the media and political arena. This module provides the economic foundations for a full understanding of these debates from a rigorous point of view. Working on the areas of financial economics and development (whether in private or public institutions) requires a solid knowledge of the topics studied in this module.The module is organised in four blocks. Part 1 focuses basic concepts and core models of the open economy and exchange rate determination. Part 2 deals with modern models of the open economy by introducing time and uncertainty. Part 3 covers two important kinds of international crises: speculative attacks on fixed exchange rates, and the current global economic crisis. This also helps to understand the importance of choosing exchange rate regimes, and how this affects economic policy choices. The module is focused on both the theory and empirical evidence. That is, we focus not only on the analytical side of the stories but also on their empirical relevance. This helps your understanding of the role of data analysis and econometric work on a research project such as the one you have to write for your dissertation.

   EC803 - Trade and Development


   
    This module is designed for students with interests in both development and international economics. It aims to discuss some of the fundamental models (and their extensions) in international economics and link them to the growth and development process of regions and countries. Throughout this module we provide you with the analytical tools and theoretical knowledge necessary to understand these links. We also focus on both the theoretical foundations and extensions of trade theory and the empirical evidence available to the current theoretical debates. The module consists of two main sections. The first one is devoted to the foundations of trade theory and it is the basic building block around which the rest of the module pivots. The second section deals with the relation between trade liberalisation, exports and long run growth, covering both the theory and empirical evidence.
