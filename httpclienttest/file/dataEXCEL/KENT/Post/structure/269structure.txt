Course structure


 The programme is divided into two stages. Stage 1 comprises modules to a total of 120 credits and Stage 2 comprises a 60 credit dissertation module. Students must successfully complete each module in order to be awarded the specified number of credits for that module. One credit corresponds to approximately ten hours of 'learning time' (including all classes and all private study and research). Thus obtaining 180 credits in an academic year requires 1,800 hours of overall learning time.

Pathways

The programme has three pathways: Research, Production or Performance. Students choose one of these pathways. The three pathways are distinguished in the four ways set out below:

A pathway will usually be reinforced by the choice of research area for the Dissertation module.

 Pathways are primarily distinguished by choices made in the Specialist Project module:
 Research: Musicological/Ethnomusicological study
 Production: Production portfolio
 Performance: Concert
 The recommended option modules for each pathway creates a further distinction between pathways:
 Research: Popular and World Music OR Collaborative Project
 Production: Cinema for the Ears OR Advanced Acoustics and Psychoacoustics
 Performance: Ensemble Performance OR Technology in Performance
 The recommended compulsory module choice creates a further distinction between pathways:
 Research: Critical and Historical Perspectives on Music
 Production: Advanced Audio Skills
 Performance: Advanced Audio Skills OR Critical and Historical Perspectives on Music


Programme Structure for Part-Time Students

In year 1, part-time students study for the Dissertation module and EITHER Critical and Historical Perspectives on Music OR Advanced Audio Skills. In year 2, part-time students study for the Specialist Project module and an option module.




 Modules


 Each module is designed to be at a specific level. To be eligible for the award of a masters degree students must obtain 180 credits, at least 150 of which must be Level M. Students who obtain 120 credits, but excluding the dissertation, will be eligible for the award of diploma.

Compulsory modules are core to the programme and must be taken by all students studying the programme. Optional modules provide a choice of subject areas, from which students will select a stated number of modules.


 

      
   MU897 - Specialist Project


   
    This module aims to develop students understanding and skills in a specialised area through student-led work. Students will be encouraged to augment their understanding of their specialism by producing a substantial piece of work in their chosen area.  This area of study will focus upon one of the following disciplines: performance, music production or music analysis.  Although students will focus upon one of these areas they will develop key insights into related areas of specialist study through whole group seminars and discussions.  Students will also be encouraged to present parts of their project and related work at other events, such as concerts and conferences, throughout the year.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

     MU622      - Ensemble Performance


     
      The module will focus upon ensemble performance skills and will allow students to develop their understanding of their principal instrument of study in the context of small ensemble or band performances.  Students will be expected to develop a far more thorough understanding of the details of and interaction between the parts of a song or work.  They will also develop far greater skill in responding sensitively to other musicians with an ear for details and articulation and pitch nuance, details that will differ from one performance to the next.  Regular workshops will be the primary mode of delivery and students will be challenged throughout the course to prepare more effectively for workshop rehearsals and to make use of rehearsal time that is evermore effective.

     MU898      - Dissertation


     
      This module aims to foster the student's ability to develop her/his research skills through student-led work, and to develop an advanced understanding of artistic endeavour. The module facilitates the transition from undergraduate level work or employment to self-management of independent postgraduate study and the formulation and presentation of an agreed research proposal and dissertation.  Through a series of themed seminars, it will address current arguments and historical paradigms surrounding arts theory and practice, considering areas such as research methods, the role of social forces in the production and reception of art, and perspectives on artistic practices and interventions.  The series will draw upon a number of disciplines, such as critical theory, cultural studies and philosophy. Students will attend the regular Music and Fine Art interdisciplinary postgraduate seminars at Medway, which will encourage the consideration and discussion of research in relation to different practices, contexts and methods.

   Assessment

  
   Assessment is by a range of coursework, including individual projects, skills-based tasks, seminar presentations and written work.
  

 
   Programme aims

  
   The programme aims to:

 enable students to develop an advanced understanding of music theory and practice taking into account developments in scholarship over the past few decades. In achieving this aim, students will focus upon theoretical and/or practice-based research methods and, in all cases, will engage a range of current research practices that address music critically.
 provide opportunities for students to develop their work through individual enquiry and through sharing and critiquing ideas at group seminars, which will provide a forum for debate as well as instruction. Staff members who have interests and expertise in various areas of music will run these seminars and students will be encouraged to take up related opportunities for collaborative and interdisciplinary work taking into account other subjects at Medway and Canterbury.
 combine taught and research modules throughout, allowing for the integrated development of generic and subject-specific acumen. More specifically, a Dissertation module will run in parallel with modules in advanced musical skills (popular musicological or compositional/ technological), specialist project work and option modules. Thus the student will begin to develop their own research expertise while gaining an advanced understanding of wider scholarly insights and skills. To this end, students will be expected to attend research seminars held in the School of Music and Fine Art and will be encouraged to attend and present at postgraduate conferences and study days at the University of Kent and other institutions.
