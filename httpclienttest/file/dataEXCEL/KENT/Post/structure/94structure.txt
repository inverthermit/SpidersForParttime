   HI815 - War, Propaganda and the Media


   
    The aim of this module is to explore the concept of propaganda and roles of the mass communications media in times of conflict.  This will involve an historical approach which takes into consideration the numerous theoretical problems associated with the study of propaganda as well as the different ways political propaganda has been interpreted and used internationally in time of war or peace. Using case studies ranging from the First World War to the present day, the aim of the module is to enable students to think critically about the manner in which propaganda is disseminated in wartime and the pressures governments, media organisations and journalists face in times of conflict.  The module explores how different types of conflict and changing technology have elicited different relationships between the media, the military and government. The module also examines the impact of the media upon public opinion and the increasingly important part played by the home front in twentieth century warfare.

   HI878 - Methods and Interpretations of Historical Research


   
    This course investigates the nature of historical research at its highest level. While postgraduate students are expected to become highly specialised researchers in their own particular field or subfield, this course encourages them to consider history as a wider discipline and to broaden their approach to evidence and interpretation. Students will be expected to engage with a variety of intellectual viewpoints and methodological approaches to the discipline, and consider the impact that other disciplines have had on the study of History. A number of dissertation workshops will be arranged to help students with their dissertations.Part I: ParadigmsHistoricism: the emergence of historical science in the 19th centuryStructural history: the challenge of the social sciencesCultural turns: history after the end of the master narrativePart II: FieldsReligious historyOral history Military historyPropaganda studies Environmental history History of medicinePart III: Portfolio and Dissertation workshops Book reviewsAnnotated bibliographies and historiographical reviewsDissertation outlinesIn addition, we will undertake field trips to archives and research libraries.

   HI915 - Landscapes of the Great War: Interpretations and Representations


   
    This module will explore the way in which different academic disciplines have dealt with the three main overarching experiences of the Great War  mobilisation, attrition and endurance and remobilisation. Each week students will be exposed to the differing interpretations and will explore the major differences between them. The agreed historical facts are therefore the starting point; the harnessing and meanings is the terminus. The module convenor will be present in all sessions chairing them and facilitating the dialogue with the contributing academics. Where possible it is expected that each seminar will have multiple academic contributors. Each section will consist of a tripartite format  week one sets up the following week in special collections with the final week being reflections on what was examined in special collections and interpreted according to the approaches of different academic disciplines.

   HI823 - Testimonies of War: Oral History in Theory and Practice


   
    This class aims to bring awareness to the possibilities of using oral history as a way of understanding the past, using the topic of twentieth-century war as a case study. It will examine the advantages and disadvantages, classic texts and theoretical and methodological insights. It also features a strong practical dimension and will provide experience in interviewing, transcription and analysis. Sessions will typically include What is Oral History?; Understanding Memory; Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity; Doing Oral History I: Plans and Preparation; Doing Oral History II: Recording, Summarising and Transcribing;  Interpretation: Reconstructive Evidence and Narrative Analysis; Oral History and Public History; Fieldtrip to The Imperial War Museum; Reflecting on the Oral History interviews I and Reflecting on the Oral History interviews II.

   HI828 - Ireland and the First World War


   
    The module will examine the experience of Ireland during the First World War. There is now considerable historiography available on Irish recruitment to the British armed forces between 1914 and 1918 and this will form the basis for three seminars; considering Nationalist and Unionist reactions to recruitment and the place of Ireland within wider UK recruitment. Political developments, caused largely by the war, namely, the decline of the Irish Parliamentary Party, rise of the Sinn Fein movement and Irish Unionisms acceptance of partition will form another important element of the module. There has been considerable work carried out on commemoration of the Great War in Ireland and Irish commemoration overseas (most notably the building of the Ulster Tower at Thiepval, France in 1921 and of the Irish Peace Park at Messines / Mesen, Belgium in 1998) and this will form the focus for two seminars. Other seminars will consider the Irish economy and the war and Irish paramilitarism between 1914 and 1918.

   HI817 - Deformed, Deranged and Deviant


   
    From those viewed as medical marvels in the nineteenth century to questions surrounding quality of life in the late twentieth century, the course explores the continuities and changes in the relationship between medical science and difference.  Between the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and into the twentieth, the increasing influence of medical practitioners ensured that disability, deformity, disfigurement and mental illness were categorised through a medical perspective. Categories about the acceptability of physical and social norms were constructed from the eighteenth century, indeed, the term normal was not commonly used in the English language until the 1840s. In the nineteenth century, the growth of capitalism and the concentration on industrialization, excluded those deemed different from the workplace and the community as they were not judged to be economically useful. In addition, philanthropic gestures which grew in the nineteenth century, saw people who were categorised as different, moved from mainstream society into institutions, which were often supported by the medical profession. Medical practitioners and the general public were fascinated by difference in body and mind, and often those considered different were observed, studied and experimented on. The influence of medical practice grew in the twentieth century and the course will explore this in relation to (amongst others) the two World Wars, the growth of special institutions and new types of therapy. Overall, the course will investigate the ways that medicine has understood, categorised and treated those whose body or behaviour was considered different. It will also examine the body and mind as contested sites; spaces occupied by those considered different; the establishment of normality versus deviance; the changing conceptions of difference in this historical period and the shifting theories and methodologies of medical practice in relation to it. Topics include:The history of anatomyIdiocy and feeblemindednessMadness The development of forensic scienceMurderDying and the rituals of deathAgency, freakery and the politics of displayHomosexuality as devianceMadness and mental health

   HI857 - Geiger Counter at Ground Zero: Explorations  of Nuclear America


   
    This module critically examines the surface and decay of Nuclear America in the twentieth century. Responsible for ushering in the modern atomic era, the USA is widely acknowledged as a pioneer in nuclear technology and weaponry.  Receptivity towards the atom has nonetheless shifted over time: atomic materials once heralded the saviour of American society (through the promise of reactors delivering electricity to cheap to meter) have also been deemed responsible for long-term environmental problems and doomsday anxieties.  Why the atom has received typically bi-polar and polemic responses is of great interest here.  Along with events of global significance (such as the bombing of Hiroshima), the module also covers the more intimate views of American citizens living and working close to ground zero.  Personal testimonies come from atomic foot soldiers traversing blast sites in the 1950s and protesters trespassing across reactor sites in the 1970s.  In particular, the module examines the role of media, propaganda and image in inventing popular understandings of the nuclear age, as well as the contribution of atomic scientists to national discourse. Themes and Topics:Popular and Scientific Ideas of Radioactivity The Manhattan Project and the Decision to drop the BombCold War (1): The RosenbergsAtomic Veterans and explorations of Ground ZeroCivil Defence and Fallout CultureAtomic Movies (1) Fantasy Cold War (2): The Cuban Missile CrisisProtesting the Peaceful Atom: Diablo Canyon and Three Mile Island Atomic Movies (2) Realism and SurvivalismCold War Memory, Legacy and Atomic Tourism

   HI860 - The British Army and the Great War


   
    This module will examine a number of aspects concerning the British army during the Great War.  The (in)effectiveness of British generalship will be examined, allowing students to explore the rich historiography of this topic which dates back to the so-called, battle of the memoirs in the 1920s.  Consideration will then be given to the structure and expansion of the four armies (regular, territorial, Kitchener and conscript) examining how effectively the British army coped with this massive expansion and trained the newly formed units.  Allied to this, there will be a consideration of manpower policy during the Great War, in particular there will be some discussion given to the propaganda elements involved in the voluntary recruiting campaigns of 1914-16 and the British experience of conscription in 1916-18.  Attention will also be given to the discipline and morale of the British army, which was the only European army of the Great War not to suffer from major problems in this area.  Students will be invited to explore the full aspects of discipline and morale and will consider why the wartime executions of 312 soldiers have come to dominate the historiography.  In terms of the British army in action, this module will contain case-studies of the well known Gallipoli campaign and the Battles of the Somme along with the lesser known so-called 100 days battles at the end of the war to consider the important issue of whether the British army did indeed participate in  what some historians have termed a learning curve during the Great War. Other topics, such as the the experience of women in the British army, the British army on the home front, logistics and officer selection will also be discussed in detail.
