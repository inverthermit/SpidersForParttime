   CO880 - Project and Dissertation


   
    Students choose their project near the beginning of term 2 in coordination with the Project Research module (CO885). Projects are normally selected from a list of suggestions proposed by the department, a number of which may involve industrial collaboration.  Alternatively, students may propose a project of their own if a suitable member of academic staff is available to act as the supervisor.  In all cases the particular project must be appropriate for, and relevant to, the student's programme of study.The project consists of an extended period during which students work on a specific piece of project work and a report on this work in the form of a dissertation.  Project work is normally undertaken individually.The project examines the student's ability to research the literature, to understand and expand on a specific technical problem commensurate with their programme of study and relate it to other work, to carry out investigations and practical work generally including programming and describe results and draw conclusions from them and to write a coherent and well organised dissertation.

   CO882 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming


   
    Building upon CO881 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, this module covers the design and implementation of high-quality software using OO techniques. Systems are modelled as configurations of objects communicating with one another. Techniques (e.g. inheritance) are introduced which allow objects to play different roles within a system. These two concepts are key to the support for adaptation and reuse that OOP provides. Much emphasis will be placed on gaining a deep understanding of these concepts and applying them in practice by developing programs in Java. The remainder of the module will explore software component frameworks, specifically those that come packaged with Java, placing most emphasis on the frameworks to support the structuring and manipulation of data (data structures and algorithms).

   CO846 - Cloud Computing


   
    From Wikipedia"Cloud computing is Internet-based computing, whereby shared servers provide resources, software, and data to computers and other devices on demand, as with the electricity grid. Cloud computing is a natural evolution of the widespread adoption of virtualization, service-oriented architecture and utility computing. Details are abstracted from consumers, who no longer have need for expertise in, or control over, the technology infrastructure "in the cloud" that supports them.Cloud computing describes a new supplement, consumption, and delivery model for IT services based on the Internet, and it typically involves over-the-Internet provision of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. It is a byproduct and consequence of the ease-of-access to remote computing sites provided by the Internet. This frequently takes the form of web-based tools or applications that users can access and use through a web browser as if it were a program installed locally on their own computer."The curriculum will include: Overview of web services and their use in grid/cloud computing; Review grid computing technologies and the relations and differences between grid computing and cloud computing; Virtualisation technologies, tools for cloud computing (Xen or KVM); Open source cloud infrastructures and applications, including Hadoop,Eucalyptus etc; Cutting edge commercial cloud infrastructure and applications.

     CO887      - Web-Based Information Systems Development


     
      Web-based information systems form the heart of e-commerce. They are also increasingly the way businesses handle all their information needs. Building such systems requires an understanding of up-to-date tools and technologies such as XML, UML, Java and databases; it also calls for an understanding of how to design systems that genuinely meet user and business needs.This module starts by examining the business context of web-based information systems. It introduces design methodologies and techniques, using UML in recording requirements. Systems implementation involves database management systems and these are studied in some depth. By the end of the module, each student will have developed a complete information system which uses XML and Java to link dynamic web pages to a database back-end.Information Systems:   Role of information systems in e-business.   IS development methodologies   Systems thinking and its relationship to IS development   Information analysis using UML   Systems design  Database Systems:   Relational and Object-Relational Database Management Systems   Database design and implementation   Database query languages   Transactions   Security and reliability  Web-related technologies:   Mark-up languages (XML, HTML, etc)   Web interfaces to databases (JDBC, servlets, etc)

     CO886      - Software Engineering


     
      Creating a quality software product requires much more than skilful programming. First of all, the requirements for the product must be determined. Unfortunately, customers' perceptions of their requirements are usually vague and incomplete, and often inconsistent too, so these perceived requirements must be carefully analysed and amplified. Before software is shipped, it is important that cost-effective measures are applied to ensure, as far as possible, that it is free from errors, especially major errors: this involves procedures such as source code analysis and inspection as well as thorough testing. But some bugs will inevitably get through to the delivered product, and it is important that users can easily submit informative bug reports that allow the problem to be quickly localised and rectified.All of the issues just described have an impact on the design of the software: it must be designed, for example, to ensure that it is amenable to thorough and systematic testing, and that if internal errors do occur, they are detected quickly before the program's data files have been irrecoverably damaged. Also, design must ensure that the software can easily be adapted and extended as the customer's requirements evolve over time.This module takes a wider view of the software development process, with an emphasis on techniques and procedures for ensuring high product quality. A key topic is the use of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) for problem analysis and software design. Towards the end of the module students have an opportunity to put theory into practice by undertaking a group project, with another group as their customer. Syllabus-  Quality standards, including ISO9001 and CMM. -  Alternative models of a software project's lifecycle, and the role of the object-oriented development paradigm in modern lifecycle concepts. -  Object-oriented modelling notations, in particular UML, and the use of these notations throughout the project lifecycle. -  Mapping of designs expressed in UML into Java code. -  Techniques for verifying models, and the conformance of one model to another. -  Approaches to software testing and inspection. -  Approaches to software configuration management

      This module is to provide the opportunity for students to undertake a substantial individual computing project on a topic of their choice. Frequently the project is chosen from the discipline of the student's previous degree programme, thus enabling students to appreciate the role of computing in diverse application domains. The project may be self-proposed or may be selected from a list of project proposals. Typically, a project will involve the specification, design, implementation, documentation and demonstration of a technical artefact. The project is supervised by a member of the academic staff, who holds weekly meetings with the student, during which s/he will give general advice and will assess the progress of the student. Attendance at these meetings is compulsory and is monitored. The supervisors will direct students towards background and research-related literature relevant to the project. The meetings also enable students to respond to suggestions from supervisors for innovative and challenging extensions to their chosen project. Towards the end of the project, the student prepares a report describing the outcome of the project, which may be supplemented by appendices that support the achievements claimed.
