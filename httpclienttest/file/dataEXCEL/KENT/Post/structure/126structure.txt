   PL821 - Medical Humanities: An Introduction


   
    Medicine is one of the great human activities.  It has a rich and deep history, and it has both created challenges for humans and solved many of our problems.  Various academic subjects  such as History, Archaeology, Literature, Philosophy, Law and Drama  have interesting perspectives on medicine.  For example, through an appreciation of some of medicines history one can see the tensions that may exist between the scientific spirit and the demands of a society.  Similarly, medical science creates interesting ethical and legal problems, both for society at large and for medical practitioners.  In this module students will study various topics about medicine through the eyes of a number of academic disciplines.  Students will also come to appreciate the different styles of thought and investigation peculiar to individual disciplines.  Whilst each topic will be dealt with on its own terms, there will be a key theme which will be explored in the module, e.g. The Humanites contribution to Medical Practice, Illness, The Medical Practitioner, Medicine and society, etc.An overarching theme and idea in this module, and the programme, is that a multidisciplinary approach through the Humanities is a highly illuminating way to appreciate medicine.

   HI817 - Deformed, Deranged and Deviant


   
    From those viewed as medical marvels in the nineteenth century to questions surrounding quality of life in the late twentieth century, the course explores the continuities and changes in the relationship between medical science and difference.  Between the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and into the twentieth, the increasing influence of medical practitioners ensured that disability, deformity, disfigurement and mental illness were categorised through a medical perspective. Categories about the acceptability of physical and social norms were constructed from the eighteenth century, indeed, the term normal was not commonly used in the English language until the 1840s. In the nineteenth century, the growth of capitalism and the concentration on industrialization, excluded those deemed different from the workplace and the community as they were not judged to be economically useful. In addition, philanthropic gestures which grew in the nineteenth century, saw people who were categorised as different, moved from mainstream society into institutions, which were often supported by the medical profession. Medical practitioners and the general public were fascinated by difference in body and mind, and often those considered different were observed, studied and experimented on. The influence of medical practice grew in the twentieth century and the course will explore this in relation to (amongst others) the two World Wars, the growth of special institutions and new types of therapy. Overall, the course will investigate the ways that medicine has understood, categorised and treated those whose body or behaviour was considered different. It will also examine the body and mind as contested sites; spaces occupied by those considered different; the establishment of normality versus deviance; the changing conceptions of difference in this historical period and the shifting theories and methodologies of medical practice in relation to it. Topics include:The history of anatomyIdiocy and feeblemindednessMadness The development of forensic scienceMurderDying and the rituals of deathAgency, freakery and the politics of displayHomosexuality as devianceMadness and mental health

   HI866 - History of Science and Communication


   
    There is no better way to understand how scientific knowledge is made and consumed today than to look at how this happened in the past.  Our examples come from 400 years ago up to the present day, and highlight how changes in the media of knowledge have shaped our understanding of science  printing presses, public lectures, museums and TV. How have audience needs and interests changed during this time, and how has the medium affected the message?  Themes and Topics The printing press and the scientific revolution Cabinets of curiosity: the first museums? Science on display in the 18th century Science and the steam-driven press in the 19th century Science and film in the 20th century Science wars and the public understanding of science in the late 20th century

The second part will examine literary representations of physical and cognitive disability in a body of twentieth- and twenty-first-century literature spanning several continents. The module will encourage students to reflect on the interface between medical and literary writing, and to contextualize these complex intersections in the scientific and medical writings of a specific period.

     CL821      - Ancient Greek Science: Astronomy and Medicine


     
      Ancient Greek concepts of rational science were vastly different from modern perceptions and discipline classifications.  Its foundation was grounded in philosophical discussions that considered the nature of the cosmos and all that existed within it.  This module demonstrates how the subjects were interlinked through a close analysis of the development of ancient astronomy and medicine, from the Minoan to the Hellenistic periods.  It discusses literary, philosophical and archaeological material.  In specific relation to astronomy, the themes to be explored are: the practical needs that led to the development of astronomy (e.g. agriculture, navigation and time-keeping); myths relating to the creation of constellations (catasterism myths); the composition of major astronomical texts and epigraphic material (e.g Eratosthenes, Katasterismoi, Aratus, Phaenomena and parapegmata inscriptions; the role of astronomical knowledge and observations to the development of Greek cosmological and philosophical thought (e.g. Aristotle and metaphysics, Plato, Aristarchus and the first heliocentric theory, Eratosthenes and the measurement of the size of the earth). With regards to medicine, the mythological significance of the Asclepiads will be discussed.  The first half of the module will focus on astronomy. The second half of the module will concentrate on medicine and begin with a discussion of the pre-Socratic philosophers introduction of the theory of the four elements: earth, air, fire and water that were present within everything, including the stars and the body.  From here students will examine how the theory of the four elements was transformed into the humoural system seen in the Hippocratic writings, and developed further through Aristotle and the Hellenistic anatomists.  Consideration will also be given to how the body and health were influenced by environment and astronomy discussed in the first half of the module.
