   TH832 - The Study of Religion: Genealogies, Inventions and Interventions


   
    The category of religion is hardwired into histories of Enlightenment, modernity, and post-modernity to the point that it is now difficult to discuss any of these periods without negotiating religion as a problem of central importance.  This course develops a multidisciplinary mapping of religion as an object of academic research in order to better understand the polemics, politics, assumptions and everyday practices which continue to determine the status of religion.  Working with various subfields within the study of religion, this comparative and collaborative course develops new maps of mutual influence, borrowing, translation and struggle between subfields, all of which produced the dominant images of religion within university and popular cultural contexts alike.Indicative topics include: how and why did the study of religion emerge as a human science opposed to earlier research on theology? What cultural and political projects shaped the category of world religion?  How did scholars of biblical and European traditions react to nineteenth-century developments in the study of Buddhist and Hindu traditions?  What were the political tendencies behind modern European and North American denigrations of ritualized practice in favour of religion as the study of belief?  What were universities roles in establishing the limits and value of the concept of the secular, and why are so many academic discussions of religion currently so keen to dislodge the same concept?Students will learn to engage in sophisticated ways with classic primary texts by those who lastingly shaped the modern invention of the academic study of religion, figures like G. W. F. Hegel, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Max M&uuml;ller, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Lucien L&eacute;vy-Bruhl, Sigmund Freud, Marcel Mauss.

   TH873 - Methodological Approaches To The Study of Religion


   
    The curriculum will be structured around classroom sessions which will introduce students to core methodological concepts and debates, key issues in research design and a range of research methods. The overall aim of this module is to provide students with a sufficiently advanced methodological grounding for them to be able to construct well-designed and conceptualised research projects at Masters level, and to have an appropriate grasp of methodological issues to be able to design and begin doctoral level research.

   TH876 - Religion, Media and Culture


   
    There is an increasing recognition within the study of religion that understanding social and cultural forms of religion necessarily involves paying attention to the media through which people engage with religion or perform their religious lives. Growing out of early work on religion and film, and new forms of religious media (e.g. televangelism), academic work in this field have broadened out from studying the representation of religion in media texts to thinking more broadly about the significance of media in relation to religion. This has opened up discussions about the ways in which religion is always mediated as well as the implications of different media forms for this process. Whilst still maintaining an interest in the context of media 'texts', this work is therefore opening up questions about the role of practice, aesthetics and the senses in media use as well as broadening what we might think of as 'media' in religious contexts.

   TH831 - Spirituality and Therapy


   
    The module will develop an understanding of what in ancient, non-Western, and modern European contexts are the historical and conceptual relationships between therapy, spiritual exercise, medical discourse, the search for wisdom or insight, and the critique of cultural life.How do the different ancient, non-Western and modern or contemporary traditions imagine happiness, enjoyment, or bliss, and what is the imagined relationship between these states and the goal of therapeutic practice?  Might something like a general theory of therapeutics, spiritual exercise, or anthropotechnics constitute an overarching category that unites what we normally imagine to be distinct areas of philosophy, psychology, religion, and clinical practice?This comparative module explores how modern psychological and psychoanalytic therapies have more to do with religious traditions of spiritual exercise than tends to be indicated by academic disciplines, acknowledged by professional therapeutic societies, or actively explored in the development of new therapeutic models.
