 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   MA552 - Analysis


   
    The concept of a limit is basic to Calculus and, unless this concept is defined precisely, uncertainties and paradoxes will creep into the subject. Based on the foundation of the real number system, this module develops the theory of convergence of sequences and series and the study of continuity and differentiability of functions. The notion of Riemann integration is also explored. The syllabus includes the following: Sequences and their convergence. The convergence of bounded increasing sequences. Series and their convergence: the comparison test, the ratio test, absolute and conditional convergence, the alternating series test. Continuous functions: the boundedness theorem, the Intermediate Value Theorem. Differentiable functions: The Mean Value Theorem with applications, power series, Taylor expansions. Construction and properties of the Riemann integral.

   MA772 - Analysis of Variance


   
    This module will build on the material on linear-models covered in the module, MA632 Regression.   Analysis of variance is a fundamentally important method for the statistical analysis of data.  It is used widely in biological, medical, psychological, sociological and industrial research.  In analysing experimental data, the appropriate form of analysis of variance is determined by the design of the experiment, and we shall therefore discuss some aspects of experimental design in this module.  Lectures are supplemented by computing classes which explore the analysis of variance facilities of the statistical package R. Syllabus: One-way ANOVA (fixed effects model); alternative models; least squares estimation; expectations of mean squares; distributional results; ANOVA table; follow-up analysis; multiple comparisons; least significant difference; confidence intervals; contrasts; orthogonal polynomials; checking assumptions; residual plots; Bartletts test; transformations; one-way ANOVA (random effects model); types of experiment; experimental and observational units; treatment structure; randomisation; replication; blocking; the size of an experiment; two-way ANOVA; the randomised complete block design; two-way layout with interaction; the general linear model; matrix formulation; models of full rank; constraints; motivations for using least squares; properties of estimators; model partitions; extra sum of squares principle; orthogonality; multiple regression; polynomial regression; comparison of regression lines; analysis of covariance; balanced incomplete block designs; Latin square designs; Youden rectangles; factorial experiments; main effects and interactions

   MA781 - Practical Multivariate Analysis


   
    Many statistical problems (in biology and psychology, for example) are multivariate, in that more than one measurement is made on each individual under study.  For example, we may be given scores on several different tests, or the levels of several chemicals in the blood.Some statistical techniques for analysing multivariate data are extensions of standard univariate techniques. Other techniques are concerned with the relationships between variables; they lead, in conjunction with modern computing techniques, to a wide variety of descriptive and exploratory tools.In this module, students will attend about 20 lectures and classes designed to introduce all the major concepts and techniques of multivariate analysis, and will do some reading and undertake a small project designed to deepen their appreciation of some of the methodology.Syllabus: Random variables and their properties; The Multivariate Normal (MN) distribution; Partial and multiple correlation; Sampling distributions based on MN; Inference for  the  MN  distribution; including  Hotelling's  T2 and multivariate analysis of variance; Likelihood ratio and Union-intersection methods; Discriminant analysis; Principal component analysis and Factor Analysis; Scaling and rotation of factors; Canonical analysis; Metric and non-metric scaling.  Methods of cluster analysis.

     MA888      - Stochastic Models in Ecology and Medicine


     
      Ecology: This part of the module deals with the analysis of data collected on wild animals. Particular attention will be given to estimating how long wild animals live, and also to estimating the sizes of mobile animal populations. Fitted probability models will allow the assessment of environmental changes, such as global warming. Complex models may contain too many parameters to be estimated, and procedures will be described for testing for this using symbolic computer packages. State-space models provide a unifying framework for many of the models considered. Both classical and Bayesian methods of inference will be used.Medicine: This part of the module also considers the estimation of surival, but in this case for human beings, with less data loss due to individuals leaving the study than in the ecological case. However, human data can be censored, and methods will be presented for graphically representing such data and fitting standard probability models. As is also true in ecology, covariates can play an important role, as will be discussed, in particular using the Cox proportional hazards model. Collected serially in time on the same individuals, covariates result in longitudinal data, such as blood pressure reading on individuals, and methods will be presented for analysing such data.The syllabus will be:Estimating abundance. Estimating survival. Using covariates; multi-state models; complex models; parameter redundancy; state-space modelling; Bayesian analysis.Human survival data with censoring; longitudinal data; The hazard and related functions; simple parametric models; repeated observations.

     MA890      - Practical Statistics and Computing


     
      Nonparametric Methods: This part of the  module comprises approximately 10 lectures on nonparametric methods, showing how they are applied in practice for testing goodness of fit to a distribution, including tests of normality, for testing randomness of a sequence, and for comparing two samples. Practical Statistics: There is no fixed syllabus for this component of the course. Students gain experience of practical data analysis through a series of assessments that confront them with unfamiliar data, which may require the use of techniques introduced in any of the other core modules of the Programme.Statistical Computing: At the start of the module, students are introduced to, and gain experience of, the document preparation system LaTeX, which enables the production of high-quality mathematical documents. Then there are sessions in which students learn the statistical package R, using a mixture of lectures and hands-on computing workshops. The initial aim is for students to gain familiarity with importing and manipulating data, producing graphs and tables, and running standard statistical analyses. The later parts of the module focus on the use of R as a programming language, introducing basic programming mechanisms such as loops, conditional statements and functions. This provides students with the means to develop their own code to undertake non-routine types of analysis if these are not already available in R.

     MA858      - Computational Statistics


     
      The module starts with an introduction to a range of atypical data sets, drawn from areas such as ecology, biology, genetics and psychology.  Each of the examples can be described by a suitable stochastic model, making use of the known background to the data, and built on the axioms of probability theory. Fitting models to data is traditionally accomplished by the method of maximum likelihood, and typically this involves numerical optimisation. The labour involved here is only feasible using a computer, and integral to the module is the use of the MATLAB integrated computer package. The module also describes modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, and MATLAB is again very useful for illustrating these methods in operation. In supervised computer practical classes you will gain experience with running a range of computer programs for modern methods of statistical analysis.  Students completing this module will possess an enviable grasp of the utility and power of modern statistics for describing real-life situations.  During the module you will cover most of the following topics: Introduction and examples. Model fitting by maximum likelihood. Function optimisation. Basic likelihood tools. Simulation techniques. Fundamental features of modelling. The EM algorithm. Generalised linear models, generalised linear mixed models. Bayesian methods. Note that this module makes excellent use of a wide range of statistical, mathematical and computational techniques, and revises and integrates material from a number of other lecture courses.

     MA867      - Project


     
      The module, which is compulsory for students of MSc in Statistics and MSc in Statistics with Finance, enables students to undertake an independent piece of work in a particular area of statistics, or statistical finance/financial econometrics and to write a coherent account of the material. A list of possible topics, together with names of Staff willing to supervise these projects, will be circulated to students in the autumn term. Projects suitable for MSc Statistics and MSc Statistics with Finance will be indicated. Students are given a briefing document containing regulations and advice on the preparation of projects. Students then choose a topic after consultation and agreement with the relevant member of staff. This is done early in the second term. The range of projects available is wide, encompassing both practical data analysis and more methodological work, although projects that are primarily theoretical will typically have obvious practical applications. In addition, students can propose their own topics, provided a suitable supervisor can be found.The dissertation is expected to be about 10,000 words excluding any appendices containing computer code and so forth. The dissertation is submitted in early September, before the start of the next academic year.

     MA883      - Bayesian Statistics


     
      The origins of Bayesian inference lie in Bayes' Theorem for density functions; the likelihood function and the prior distribution combine to provide a posterior distribution which reflects beliefs about an unknown parameter based on the data and prior beliefs. Statistical inference is determined solely by the posterior distribution. So, for example, an estimate of the parameter could be the mean value of the posterior distribution.This module will provide a full description of Bayesian analysis and cover popular models, such as the normal distribution. Initially, the flavour will be one of describing the Bayesian counterparts to well known classical procedures such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.Current methods for inference involving posterior distributions typically involve sampling strategies. That is, due to the complicated nature of some posterior distributions, analytic methods fail to provide meaningful summaries. Hence, sampling from the posterior has become popular. A full description of  sampling techniques, starting from rejection sampling, will be given. The syllabus will be:Conjugate models (prior and posterior belong to the same family of parametric models). Predictive distributions; Bayes estimates; Sampling density functions; Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings samplers; Winbugs; Bayesian regression and hierarchical models; Bayesian model choice; Decision theory; Objective priors; Exchangeability.

     MA884      - Principles of Data Collection


     
      This module explores the important roles that Statisticians play in planning how data are collected. Well-planned studies can help to ensure that key questions of interest can be addressed unambiguously and can improve the precision of the conclusions of the study.  The two main types of study considered are sample surveys and designed experiments. For sample surveys, we study different variations of random sampling, the use of auxiliary information and practical issues such as the importance of questionnaire design and the problem of non-response. For experimental design, we start with the general principles of randomization, replication and blocking and study a variety of common designs and their analysis. Next we introduce hierarchical designs and components of variance. The module concludes by considering some of the specific issues that arise in the design of clinical trials, which are of great importance in medical and pharmaceutical applications.The Syllabus will be Sampling: Simple random sampling. Sampling for proportions and percentages. Estimation of sample size. Stratified sampling. Systematic sampling. Ratio and regression estimates. Cluster sampling. Multi-stage sampling and design effect. Questionnaire design. Response bias and non-response.  General principles of experimental design: blocking, randomization, replication. Orthogonal designs. Factorial designs: confounding, fractional replication. Analysis of covariance. Non-orthogonal designs. Hierarchical designs: Fixed and random effects models. Split-plot designs. Variance components.  Design of clinical trials: blinding, placebos, eligibility, ethics, data monitoring and interim analysis. Good clinical practice, the statistical analysis plan, the protocol. Equivalence and noninferiority. Sample size. Phase I, II, III and IV trials. Parallel group trials. Crossover trials. Multicentre trials.
