Course structure


 This programme develops your practice towards establishing a creative, critical and independent practice. You have your own studio space in which to explore and test your studio work, with full access to workshops and high-quality resources at our new multimillion-pound development on the Chatham Historic Dockyard, just 55 minutes from London.

The programme welcomes students who wish to pursue any form of artistic practice in an interdisciplinary studio-based research environment. A core series of critical studies lectures, seminars, tutorials and collaborative opportunities allow you to develop your awareness of key issues in contemporary culture. We also offer opportunities for working with museums and galleries outside of the University, developing your specialism towards the achievement of professional excellence within your field.




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   FA800 - Fine Art


   
    The Module aims to develop: 1) A resolved project of practice based research demonstrating self reflexivity and informed decision making in the processes of producing a body of practice based work in an exhibition of art work; 2) knowledge of the contexts in which methods are applied in practice and how these inform research choices; 3) awareness of the processes and conditions of analysis and critical discussion within and surrounding arts practice; and, 4) independently motivated practice that is of a high professional standard. Students will attend a core seminar series where they present their practice to the cohort. This is supplemented and supported by lectures, tutorials and visits to art institutions that focus on the study of method and context. Lectures will deliver key themes that are taken up each year, and which deal with current issues and debates in contemporary culture. These will be delivered by external visitors and in-house staff. The Module will culminate in a Final Degree exhibition of work for assessment.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   FA801 - Development of Practice


   
    The Module aims to develop: 1) the processes and conditions of analysis and critical discussion within and surrounding arts practice; and, 2) independently motivated practice, as a means to develop work to an advanced standard. Students will be expected to develop work towards an interim exhibition, evidencing understanding of the contexts and issues in the production of their work for audiences of art. This work in practice research and writing is aimed to develop conclusive statements on the direction and aims of the research towards the Module entitled Resolution. Students will also attend a core seminar series where they present their practice to the cohort. This is supplemented and supported by lectures, tutorials and visits to art institutions. Lectures will deliver key themes that are taken up each year, and which deal with current issues and debates in contemporary culture. These will be delivered by external visitors and in-house staff. Themes may include: Transgression, Neutrality, Global identities, Public/Private and Protest.

   FA803 - Collaborative Project


   
    This module is designed to promote interdisciplinary collaboration as a core process of creative engagement. Students will either work in small groups of two or three, work with external partners or collaborate as an entire cohort in order to produce an event, exhibition, or project, either on, or off site with partner institutions. Processes of performance, intervention, programme, participation and interaction between audience, artist and site will be explored through interdisciplinary arts practice within specific temporal and spatial contexts. Each student will produce independent documentation of the project in the form of a catalogue, video, audio work or other publication. The submission will also include contextual writing, in addition to live and/or recorded sound, still and/or moving image production and design.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   MU898 - Dissertation


   
    This module aims to foster the student's ability to develop her/his research skills through student-led work, and to develop an advanced understanding of artistic endeavour. The module facilitates the transition from undergraduate level work or employment to self-management of independent postgraduate study and the formulation and presentation of an agreed research proposal and dissertation.  Through a series of themed seminars, it will address current arguments and historical paradigms surrounding arts theory and practice, considering areas such as research methods, the role of social forces in the production and reception of art, and perspectives on artistic practices and interventions.  The series will draw upon a number of disciplines, such as critical theory, cultural studies and philosophy. Students will attend the regular Music and Fine Art interdisciplinary postgraduate seminars at Medway, which will encourage the consideration and discussion of research in relation to different practices, contexts and methods.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).
