Course structure


In addition to traditional PhD research programmes, we offer an engineering doctorate (EngD). The Engineering Doctorate is for students who want a career in industry. A four-year programme combines PhD-level research projects with taught courses, and students spend about 75% of their time working directly with a company.

As well as offering excellent research facilities and equipment, the School allows students the opportunity to participate in regular research seminars and workshops and offers students the possibility of attending international conferences in order to present their work. As a research student in the School, you will become a member of one of our thriving research groups
