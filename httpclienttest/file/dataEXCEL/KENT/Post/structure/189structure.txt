Course structure


The research interests of the group are in line with the mainstream of statistics, with emphasis on both theoretical and applied subjects.

There are strong connections with a number of prestigious research universities such as Texas A M University, the University of Texas, the University of Otago, the University of Sydney and other research institutions at home and abroad.

The group regularly receives research grants. The EPSRC has awarded two major grants, which support the National Centre for Statistical Ecology (NCSE), a joint venture between several institutions. A BBSRC grant supports stochastic modelling in bioscience.
