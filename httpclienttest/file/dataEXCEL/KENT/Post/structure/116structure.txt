   HI874 - Religion and Society in Seventeenth-Century  England


   
     Religion has often been regarded as the motor for change and upheaval in 17th century England: it has been seen as the prime cause of civil war, the inspiration for the godly rule of Oliver Cromwell and the Saints, and central to the Glorious Revolution of 1688-9. Fears of popery, it has been suggested, helped forge English national identify. This module reflects critically on these claims. It explores tensions within English Protestantism, which led to an intense struggle for supremacy within the English Church in the early 17th century, to be followed in the 1640s and 1650s by the fragmentation of Puritanism into numerous competing sects which generated a remarkable proliferation of radical ideas on religion and society. The Restoration of Church and King in 1660 saw the gradual and contested emergence of a dissenting community and the partial triumph of religious tolerance, with profound implications for English society and culture. Another key theme is the changing fortunes of Anglicanism, with its erosion of its position from a national Church to the established Church over the century. The marginal position of English Catholics in 17th century England, albeit with a genuine possibility of significant recovery of rights and influence under James II, is also crucial. The module will address issues of theology, the close relationship between political power and religious change, and the nature of debates on religion at national and local level, and also track elements of continuity and change over a formative century in English religious experience.

   MT864 - Reading the Medieval Town:  Canterbury, an   International City


   
    This course will focus on a number of inter-related themes which will be studied through differing types of evidence from written and printed texts to objects and standing buildings. Consequently, certain seminars will take place outside the seminar room, looking at the evidence in situ. Topics will include the medieval topography, civic governance, urban defence, house and household, commercial practices and premises, parish church development, the place of religious houses, pilgrimage and city-crown relations, as a way of examining issues such as space, power, patronage and responses to changing social, political and economic conditions. Students will be encouraged to think comparatively, both nationally and internationally, to assess Canterburys place within medieval European society.

   MT859 - Word and Image in Tudor England


   
    The module is structured around a selection from eight topics: poetry, portraiture, and self-fashioning in the Henrician and/or Elizabethan courts; private miniatures and sonnets; emblems and emblem books; title-pages and book illustration; maps; iconomachy; death, elegies and funerary arts; masques. Each seminar will examine a set of visual texts (reproduced in books and/or available online) alongside selected literary texts, and criticism. Where possible relevant documents in the Cathedral Archives and Library and/or surviving material culture (such as funerary monuments in the Canterbury area) will also be studied, and students will be encouraged to initiate their own case studies of visual-verbal imagery and culture based on local archives (thereby drawing students attention to research possibilities in the field locally). Issues of ongoing concern to the course will include the consumption and social function of visual-verbal imagery, the spaces in which such imagery was used, the ways in which writers approached visual-verbal relations in the period and, more generally, the possibilities and problems of interdisciplinary criticism.
