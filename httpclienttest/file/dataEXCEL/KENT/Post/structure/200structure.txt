   TZ861 - Social Psychology of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities


   
    All academic modules are taught using a combination of web-based resources, reading, the introductory workshop and a one-week workshop in the Spring. For each module, there will be web-based materials including video-recorded lectures, web-based discussions/seminars, and quizzes/group exercises. Students are also expected to conduct their own literature searches and follow-up the core reading and the reference lists for each topic coveredThe aim of this module is to teach the basic facts about the nature and origins of intellectual and developmental disabilities, including definitions of learning disability, epidemiology, biological, social and environmental causes of learning disability. In addition, characteristics of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities will be considered (including cognitive and social characteristics) along with issues such as autism, ageing, transition, early intervention, physical & mental health, parenting, sexuality and people with intellectual and developmental disability in the criminal justice system.


    Credits: 10 credits
     (5 ECTS credits).

   TZ863 - Service issues in Intellectual and Development Disabilities


   
    The aim of this module is to give students an understanding of organisational issues involved in learning disability services, including institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation, theories of normalisation and criticisms of these theories, methods of analysing quality of life and care and ways of producing change in services. This module is taught as a web-based guided study module with seminars at several points in the first term. For AIIDD students, this module is closely linked to the service placement and discussion and application of web-based units will occur during placement supervision.

    The aim of this module is to help students/practitioners to articulate and work within a person-centred, scientific, and appropriately ethical framework.Topics will include: Ethical and legal issues The role of ideology in the development of intellectual disability services The development of approaches to individual planning and needs assessment, particularly the role of person-centred planning Ethical codes and guidelines  does Behaviour Analysis raise special ethical issues? Codes of professional practice  Discrimination and abuse Adopting person-centred, values-based approaches to children and adults with complex needs.

   TZ869 - Concepts of Applied Behaviour Analysis


   
    The aim of this module is to develop an advanced understanding of the concepts and principles underpinning applied behaviour analysis.Topics will include: Defining characteristics of applied behaviour analysis Operant and respondent conditioning Reinforcement Extinction and punishment Avoidance and escape Stimulus control and equivalence relations Establishing operations and setting events Verbal behaviour and private events Using behaviour analytic concepts to interpret complex behaviour.

   TZ870 - Observation and Analysis of Behaviour


   
    The aim of this module is to develop competencies in the definition, observation, recording and analysis of behaviour and its controlling variables. Topics will include: Observational methods of data collection Reliability and validity of observational data Practical approaches to checking and calculating reliability Visual representation of data Descriptive assessment and experimental analysis including internal and external validity Practical and theoretical aspects of using reversal, multiple-baseline, alternating treatments and changing criterion designs Visual and statistical interpretation of single case data.

   TZ871 - Developing and implementing interventions


   
    The aim of this module is to develop advanced understanding of the design and implementation of positive strategies to improve the social and intellectual functioning of vulnerable populations, their carers and their peers. Topics will include: Approaches to increasing behaviour Approaches to developing new behaviour Descriptive and experimental analysis of challenging behaviour Barriers to implementation Procedural reliability Generalisation and maintenance.

   TZ830 - Research Methods


   
    The aim of this module is to teach students about research methodology and the knowledge needed to access and interpret the research literature. For those who take the statistical analysis element, the aim is also to teach appropriate statistical techniques for the analysis of quantitative data. The emphasis will be on methods of data collection and analysis which will be useful in practice settings, so that advanced multivariate techniques will not be taught.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   TZ872 - Work-Based Learning in Applied Behaviour Analysis


   
     The aim of the work-based learning module is to support and supervise students as they practice and become more skilled in the application of applied behaviour analysis with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.There is no set curriculum for this module. Learning and teaching will focus on consolidating the knowledge and skills developed through taught modules, and applying their learning to their workplace or comparable environment. Students will receive group supervision to complete a case study of work with an individual.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   TZ865 - Extended Essay


   
    All students will write one 6000 word essay on a topic which requires them to draw on material from the service issues, social psychology and behavioural analysis and intervention modules. This will be done over the course of the year for full time students and in the second year for part time students and will be submitted during the third term of the final year. 


    Credits: 15 credits
