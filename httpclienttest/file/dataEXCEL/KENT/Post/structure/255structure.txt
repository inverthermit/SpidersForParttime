     CL821      - Ancient Greek Science: Astronomy and Medicine


     
      Ancient Greek concepts of rational science were vastly different from modern perceptions and discipline classifications.  Its foundation was grounded in philosophical discussions that considered the nature of the cosmos and all that existed within it.  This module demonstrates how the subjects were interlinked through a close analysis of the development of ancient astronomy and medicine, from the Minoan to the Hellenistic periods.  It discusses literary, philosophical and archaeological material.  In specific relation to astronomy, the themes to be explored are: the practical needs that led to the development of astronomy (e.g. agriculture, navigation and time-keeping); myths relating to the creation of constellations (catasterism myths); the composition of major astronomical texts and epigraphic material (e.g Eratosthenes, Katasterismoi, Aratus, Phaenomena and parapegmata inscriptions; the role of astronomical knowledge and observations to the development of Greek cosmological and philosophical thought (e.g. Aristotle and metaphysics, Plato, Aristarchus and the first heliocentric theory, Eratosthenes and the measurement of the size of the earth). With regards to medicine, the mythological significance of the Asclepiads will be discussed.  The first half of the module will focus on astronomy. The second half of the module will concentrate on medicine and begin with a discussion of the pre-Socratic philosophers introduction of the theory of the four elements: earth, air, fire and water that were present within everything, including the stars and the body.  From here students will examine how the theory of the four elements was transformed into the humoural system seen in the Hippocratic writings, and developed further through Aristotle and the Hellenistic anatomists.  Consideration will also be given to how the body and health were influenced by environment and astronomy discussed in the first half of the module.
