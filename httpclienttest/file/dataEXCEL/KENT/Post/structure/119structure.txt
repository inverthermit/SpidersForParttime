Course structure


 You take common modules in research methods and postgraduate study skills, while giving you the opportunity to foster your subject skills in specialist modules. Work is developed through individual enquiry as well as sharing and critiquing ideas through group seminars, designed to provide a forum for debate as well as practical instruction.

There will also be significant opportunity for collaborative and interdisciplinary work taking into account other subjects within the School of Music and Fine Art.

   MU897 - Specialist Project


   
    This module aims to develop students understanding and skills in a specialised area through student-led work. Students will be encouraged to augment their understanding of their specialism by producing a substantial piece of work in their chosen area.  This area of study will focus upon one of the following disciplines: performance, music production or music analysis.  Although students will focus upon one of these areas they will develop key insights into related areas of specialist study through whole group seminars and discussions.  Students will also be encouraged to present parts of their project and related work at other events, such as concerts and conferences, throughout the year.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   FA803 - Collaborative Project


   
    This module is designed to promote interdisciplinary collaboration as a core process of creative engagement. Students will either work in small groups of two or three, work with external partners or collaborate as an entire cohort in order to produce an event, exhibition, or project, either on, or off site with partner institutions. Processes of performance, intervention, programme, participation and interaction between audience, artist and site will be explored through interdisciplinary arts practice within specific temporal and spatial contexts. Each student will produce independent documentation of the project in the form of a catalogue, video, audio work or other publication. The submission will also include contextual writing, in addition to live and/or recorded sound, still and/or moving image production and design.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   MU530 - Interdisciplinary Project


   
    The purpose of this module is to provide opportunity for self-directed group exploration in the creation of a collaboratively developed interdisciplinary practical research project. Although each student will have to negotiate an individual and personal Learning Contract with a supervising tutor, the focus of this module remains interdisciplinary and collaborative. This will be achieved through a system of lectures, workshops, mentoring, negotiation and tutor supervision. Group projects between 3 and 5 students will be considered. Projects are undertaken and evaluated with tutor guidance. Examples of studies include: performance projects, audio-visual work and multi-media projects.


    Credits: 30 credits

   MU621 - Technology in Performance


   
    The module concentrates on the development of students skills in performing with music technology, exploring live electronic music with a particular focus on recent developments in laptop music performance. The students will take part in music activities, including group performance. Topics include current use of various interfaces, combination of live instruments with electronic devices, and live processing. Students will develop their understanding of the role of technology in performance, their sensitivity to material introduced during performance by the group, and the interaction of live and processed musical elements.

   MU622 - Ensemble Performance


   
    The module will focus upon ensemble performance skills and will allow students to develop their understanding of their principal instrument of study in the context of small ensemble or band performances.  Students will be expected to develop a far more thorough understanding of the details of and interaction between the parts of a song or work.  They will also develop far greater skill in responding sensitively to other musicians with an ear for details and articulation and pitch nuance, details that will differ from one performance to the next.  Regular workshops will be the primary mode of delivery and students will be challenged throughout the course to prepare more effectively for workshop rehearsals and to make use of rehearsal time that is evermore effective.

   MU898 - Dissertation


   
    This module aims to foster the student's ability to develop her/his research skills through student-led work, and to develop an advanced understanding of artistic endeavour. The module facilitates the transition from undergraduate level work or employment to self-management of independent postgraduate study and the formulation and presentation of an agreed research proposal and dissertation.  Through a series of themed seminars, it will address current arguments and historical paradigms surrounding arts theory and practice, considering areas such as research methods, the role of social forces in the production and reception of art, and perspectives on artistic practices and interventions.  The series will draw upon a number of disciplines, such as critical theory, cultural studies and philosophy. Students will attend the regular Music and Fine Art interdisciplinary postgraduate seminars at Medway, which will encourage the consideration and discussion of research in relation to different practices, contexts and methods.

   Assessment

  
   Assessment is by a range of coursework, including individual projects, skills-based tasks, seminar presentations and written work.
  

 
   Programme aims

  
   The programme aims to:

 enable students to develop an advanced understanding of music theory and practice taking into account developments in scholarship over the past few decades. In achieving this aim, students will focus upon theoretical and/or practice-based research methods and, in all cases, will engage a range of current research practices that address music critically.
 provide opportunities for students to develop their work through individual enquiry and through sharing and critiquing ideas at group seminars, which will provide a forum for debate as well as instruction. Staff members who have interests and expertise in various areas of music will run these seminars and students will be encouraged to take up related opportunities for collaborative and interdisciplinary work taking into account other subjects at Medway and Canterbury.
 combine taught and research modules throughout, allowing for the integrated development of generic and subject-specific acumen. More specifically, a Dissertation module will run in parallel with modules in advanced musical skills (musicological or compositional/ technological), specialist project work and option modules. Thus the student will begin to develop their own research expertise while gaining an advanced understanding of wider scholarly insights and skills. To this end, students will be expected to attend research seminars held in the School of Music and Fine Art and will be encouraged to attend and present at postgraduate conferences and study days at the University of Kent and other institutions.
