   SO823 - Social Change & Political Order


   
    Much thinking about political order in the modern world has taken the state for granted as a normal feature of political life. It has been common to assume that1) Political order can be observed by observing a set of rules for how government is supposed to operate.2) Political institutions are entirely separate from social relations, or: political institutions are a direct reflection of broader society.3) Social change happens in one direction and change is always for the better.4) Order is the opposite of disorder.The sociological tradition offers many resources for examining empirically a) how government actually works b) how the relationship between the social and the political is imagined and institutionalized in different ways c) how change can be specified as a change in social form before it is evaluated and d) what the order of disorder and the disorder of order might be. In the last two decades, the changes associated with globalization have given new impetus for a historically grounded and empirically rich comparative sociology of political forms. In this course, we will compare political orders across history and across geographical areas or scales, mostly focusing on the west within modernity. We will discuss some of the conceptual tools others have found useful in such an exercise We will try to specify different ways political orders can vary and change and the different social factors that may make one outcome or other more likely. On that basis, we will be able to assess some of the common claims about the changing political order in times of globalization.

   SO832 - Critical Social Research: Truth, Ethics and Power


   
    This course provides students with the understanding and skills necessary to use research, whether within a research career or outside of it.  Building on other training in the details of specific methods, it focuses on two sets of broader questions.  Firstly, it looks at uncertainty in social research  how confident are we about what we know?  In answering this question it looks at issues of quality in qualitative and quantitative research, the difficulties of causal inference and generalisation, coming to conclusions from research reviews, and philosophical issues around truth and values.  Secondly, it looks at the link between research and action.  In doing this, it goes from the very practical (how to ensure that your research is used by policymakers and/or practitioners, and to deal with the political pressures on researchers) to the conceptual (in what ways does evidence get used by wider society?) to the normative (should researchers be critical, and if so, what are their ethical obligations in doing this?).

   SO833 - Design of Social research


   
    Module Summary: This module aims to provide students with the skills to develop a research idea and to turn this into a coherent, achievable  and interesting!  research proposal.  The course will be particularly useful for those doing empirical research in their MSc or PhD dissertation, or who will use social research after their studies.In developing these skills, the course also provides an introduction to research methods and methodological debates.  It will cover:1. Key skills in research design  developing a research question; writing a research proposal; and real-world considerations like ethics, cost, and feasibility;2. Qualitative research design  an overview of different types of qualitative methods and the logic of qualitative design; when to apply qualitative methods; and key design issues such as choosing cases and planning qualitative analysis;3. Quantitative research design  an introduction to the logic of quantitative research, and key issues such as turning the social world into numbers; when to apply quantitative methods; issues surrounding generalisation; how to interpret quantitative analysis results, and an introduction to the most common form of quantitative analysis;4. Mixed-methods designs, which combine qualitative and quantitative research. This course is complementary to the specialist courses in doing qualitative (SO817) and quantitative (SO819) research, and the course Using Social Research  Advanced Critical Skills (SO832).

   SA803 - Politics and Sociology of the Environment


   
    This module is particularly concerned with the forms and outcomes of the political contention and mobilisation around environmental issues, ranging from pressure groups, formal environmental movement organisations and Green parties to local environmental activism and radical environmental protest. It also considers the relationship between democracy and the environment: is democracy good for the environment? Would more deliberative forms of democracy improve matters? The approach is cross-nationally comparative and will also consider issues of global environmental politics.

   PO926 - Designing Democracy


   
    One of the most prominent political trends during the twentieth century has been the global expansion of democracy.  Over the last one hundred years, the number of countries labelled democratic has quadrupled, concentrated in successive waves of democracy.  This module examines the reasons for, and processes by which, countries move from authoritarian to democratic conditions.  It considers the meaning and measurement of democracy and the nature of democratic transitions.  It examines the evidence, drawn from a well established comparative literature, on which factors  social, cultural, political and economic  underpin the global shift to democracy.  It also considers how far the trend towards democracy might have come to an end, manifested in the growing number of countries that are only partially democratic.Having reviewed these broad trends and factors, the module turns to consider the process of democratic building or consolidation.  A major challenge to this process occurs in societies marked by social or ethnic cleavages.  In such societies, the desirability and nature of democratic government is often hotly contested, and special mechanisms are often required to encourage distinctive social groups to submit to democratic authority.  One means by which this can be done is via appropriately designed political institutions.  Such institutions  in particular, electoral systems, presidential and parliamentary executives and federalism  can be selected, or designed, to promote certain patterns of behaviour among citizens, potentially overcoming deep-rooted social cleavages and tensions, encouraging cooperation between groups and reducing the incentives for corrupt activities.  For this reason, much attention has recently focused on the role that constitutional design can play in democratic transitions in Eastern Europe, Africa, Afghanistan and Iraq.  Throughout, the module focuses both on key theoretical arguments within the democratisation literature (eg. definitions of democracy, the nature of democratic transitions, and the role of political institutions in dealing with entrenched social divisions) and on case studies of recent and ongoing democratic transitions.

   SA806 - Social Science Perspectives on Environmental Issues


   
    This module aims to widen students' knowledge of a variety of topical and/or scientifically important or controversial environmental issues, to encourage students to look at environmental studies from the perspectives of the several social science disciplines (anthropology, law, political science, social policy, and sociology), to make connections between questions stimulated by their own individual disciplinary backgrounds and those raised in the course, and to reflect critically upon the advantages and limitations of the various perspectives. The module covers a variety of topics which are likely to include: the nature of environmental issues; the social construction of risk and the precautionary principle; global warming, climate change and energy policy; the rise of environmental consciousness and environmentalism; food and agriculture; environmental policy and regulation; environmental policy and law; ecotourism; ecology and development; traditional societies and sustainability.

   SO876 - Organised Civil Society and the Third Sector


   
    The module provides an up to date overview of the range of contributions of the third sector to economic, social and political life. It includes analysis of definitions and categorisations, and the problematic boundaries between OCS, the third sector, the State and the market; foundational theories of third sector existence, organisation, functioning and behaviour; attention to the historical and current public policy agenda in relation to OCS and the third sector, in the UK and internationally; and reviews important approaches to evaluation in the third sector.

   PO817 - Resistance and Alternatives to Capitalism andDemocracy


   
    This module is situated at the interface of political theory and political economy. It seeks to explore the complex and multi-faceted links between democracy and capitalism in the period from 1848 to the present day. The particular focus is on relations between the state and the market as well as the evolution of different democratic regimes and market economies. Similar emphasis will be on conceptual issues and empirical evidence (though no statistical or econometric skills will be required).The first part of the module examines the formation of market-states, beginning with a critical discussion of this concept in recent scholarship. This will be the starting point for a wider engagement with Smithian, Marxist, Keynesian and neo-liberal accounts. The focus will be on those who theorise the conditions for the convergence of state and market, including Smith, Marx, Keynes and Friedman but also some contemporary theorists. Emphasis will be on strategies of resistance and alternatives to capitalism (e.g. Karl Polanyi, Catholic Social Teaching, civil economy).The second part turns to the evolution of democracy in relation to capitalism. A brief survey of the recent post-democracy literature will be followed by a discussion of key concepts. Examples include the work of the Frankfurt School on capitalism and democracy as quasi-religions and various arguments that formal democratic representation and abstract capitalist exchange engender a society of spectacle. Just as the first part focuses on the state and the market, so the second part puts emphasis on the interaction between the politics of democracy and the economics of capitalism.

   PO824 - International Relations Theory


   
    Whenever we make a statement about international affairs, we rely on certain (often implicit) theoretical assumptions: about power, interests, identities, norms and how they relate to the behaviour of international actors. Whether we like it or not, we are doomed to rely on theories. The starting-point of this course is not that theories are the only possible and all-encompassing approach to the study of international affairs, but that they are helpful to understand, compare and critically evaluate interpretations of international issues: if we all use theoretical assumptions, we better make them explicit and understood, to make sure what exactly we are claiming.International Relations theories are not approached as strict categories with clear boundaries, but rather as a continuously evolving debate. The course does not attempt to give an encyclopedic overview of all theories of International Relations, but rather to confront different views. The main objective is to understand the core differences between different theoretical approaches. The course starts by discussing the nature of theorizing in international relations, pointing out how theories do not simply explain or predict, they tell us what possibilities exist for human action and intervention, they define not merely our explanatory possibilities, but also our ethical and practical horizons  (Smith, 1996: 113).  Some of the core dividing lines underlying theoretical debates (explaining/understanding, positivism/post-positivism, rationalism/constructivism, etc.) are also introduced.. After that, different theories are studied in depth.The course proceeds through successive phases of IR theory. The first phase, that of liberal internationalism (also referred to as inter-war idealism emerged in the aftermath of WW1. We will engage with the leading authors of that tradition and find in their works the foundations of our modern world: international law, economic interdependence and international organization. In the third week we turn to the second phase of IR Theory, classical Realism, who responded to the failure of inter-war idealism by reasserting the nature of the political in IR as being predicated on clashing interests. The English School, who focus on the idea of International Society, are the focus of the fourth week. In week 5 and 6 we move to the first epistemological break in IR, with both Neorealism and Neoliberalism breaking decisively away from the classical approach championed by Hedley Bull. Running in parallel with mainstream IR, Marxist theorists were also developing Methods designed to adapt and apply Marxism to global politics, their work is examined in week 7. In week 8 we encounter another epistemological break: this time between positivism and post-positivism, a debate about the nature and limits of theory that continues to shape the discipline.  In week 9, Critical Theorys focus on human emancipation is brought to the fore. In week 10, the leading challenger to Neorealism and Neoliberalism, social constructivism, will be examined. In week 11, the classes will revolve around two major ethical positions in IR, cosmopolitanism and Realism. The course will conclude in week 12 with a revision session.

     PO936      - Resistance in Practice


     
      This module will look at how ideas of resistance are translated into political action. What are the modalities, costs and consequences of this process? We will look at specific instances of resistance to political authority and examine the techniques of resistance employed, the assumptions that underpin these techniques, and the tensions and problems that arise as ideas are actualised in political reality. Studying historical examples of resistance will help us reflect on the complex relationship between theory and practice in political reality.As part of the Resistance in Practice module, students can choose between submitting an academic essay on a historical instance of resistance and performing a practice of resistance. We envision that such practices of resistance could involve poetry, theatre, painting, sculpture, video, film, photography, music and other forms of artistic expression. The practice has to be a documented practice, which means that students have to submit not just the performance but also a portfolio in which they reflect on what they did and why. Early on in the module, students interested in submitting a documented practice for assessment discuss their ideas with the module convenor, and they will continue to work on their projects with the help of a supervisor.

     PO937      - Resistance in Theory


     
      This module will address the relationship between theories and practices of resistance from the perspective of theory. As such, it will focus on specific ideas and models that conceptualise and theorise resistance to political authority with a view to examining the following: the philosophical and political bases of resistance; the presuppositions that underpin theories of resistance; the appeal to alternative ideas and arrangements; the tensions and possible contradictions that characterise such theories. There are two dimensions to this module. First of all, the theme of resistance will be explored in the history of political ideas, from Plato via patristic, medieval and modern thinkers to contemporary writings such as those of Alain Badiou. Secondly, the theme of resistance will be related to different conceptions of the political and rival accounts of alternative arrangements to the prevailing order. As such, this module provides a strong grounding in theories of resistance that prepares students for the second core module on practices of resistance.

     PO942      - Resistance and the Politics of Truth


     
      The truth will set you free is a maxim that is central to both theories and practices of resistance. It is a claim that has, nonetheless, come under fire from a wide array of critical perspectives not the least of which are those of the poststructuralist and post-foundational political philosophies that have emerged during the second half of the twentieth century and that continue to inspire admiration and condemnation in almost equal measure. In this module, poststructuralist will refer to a body of work produced primarily in France since the 1960s that challenged our understanding of truth by developing the critique of humanism in ways that emphasised the contingent nature of meaning generating structures. The main representatives of this perspective in this module will be Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. By post-foundational is meant a body of work that critically questions poststructuralist approaches to contingency while reinvigorating the concept of truth as a political force. The primary representative of this approach is Alain Badiou. Both perspectives have developed event-oriented philosophies  that view the category of the event as ontologically primary  but they have conceived of this in competing ways. A main theme of the module will be how to understand the relationship between truth and politics as an event.  In other words, what happens in practices of resistance?

     PO859      - Human Rights in a World of States


     
      Emerging from the ashes of World War II and the Holocaust, human rights have become a critical part of international law and diplomacy in the world today. This course is designed to provide an overview of issues central to the theory and practice of human rights in international politics. In this course we will consider contemporary debates surrounding the meaning, role, and the universality of human rights and examine explanations of violations of, as well as adherence to, human rights principles through a focus on the role of the UN system, states, and NGOs, and processes of norm socialisation and domestic change. We will use case studies to highlight the effectiveness of different theories and processes concerning the role of human rights in international politics. Students will conduct in-depth research into the human rights of a chosen country and further gain practical experience in human rights reporting by writing a shadow report of that countrys adherence to international human rights law.

     PO866      - Federalism and Federal Political Systems


     
      The focus of this module is on the study of federalism and federal political systems. It introduces students to the main theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject and addresses the conceptual distinction between federalism and federation, encouraging them to explore the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the distinction. Analysis of the conceptual basis to federal systems is followed by a detailed examination of the origins, formation, evolution and operation of the major federations that span two distinct federal traditions, namely, the Anglo-American and the Continental European. The federations examined are: the United States of America; Canada, Australia, Germany and Switzerland. Students are expected to appreciate the historical specificity of each case study and to grapple with the subtleties and complexities inherent in the peculiar circumstances of the origins, formation and evolution of each federation. The module concludes with a brief look at the British tradition of federalism and a more detailed analysis of federalism and European Union. This is a module deliberately designed as a required module for the overall MA programme and is intended to run in the Autumn term as a pre-requisite for the following module, Comparative Federal Political Systems, that will run in the Spring term.

     PO885      - Decision Making in the European Union


     
      This module provides an advanced understanding of the decision-making process in the European Union, across its three main levels of governance: Union, states and regions. It focuses on the key institutions involved in the process and analyses their interaction from a theoretical, empirical and normative perspective. At the theoretical level, the module familiarises you with competing theoretical approaches to key aspects of decision-making such as preference formation, coalition formation, bargaining, policy implementation and delegation and accountability. At the empirical level, it applies these theories to the decision-making process of the European Union such as preference formation at the state level, coalition bargaining in the Council, legislative bargaining between Commission, Council and Parliament and policy implementation by state and regions. At the normative level, it evaluates these issues against key normative principles and relates them to the debate on institutional reform of the European Union with particular attention to questions of legitimacy and accountability.

     SO838      - The Idea of Civil Society


     
      The module provides an up to date overview of how key social science thinkers from across the social sciences have understood and analysed the relevance and contribution of civil society in their models and theories. It explores how contemporary scholars have continued to use their ideational frameworks to explore current social, political and economic problems and issues. It starts by acknowledging some of the key antecedents to contemporary notions of civil society in classical and pre-modern thought, and then systematically reviews how leading theorists of, and commentators on, post Enlightenment social and political developments have defined this sphere, and accounted for its roles and contributions in their formulations. Most of these writers have crossed what we now think of as disciplinary boundaries In each case, their basic socio-political models are reviewed, their accounts of civil society explicated and critiqued, and the applications of their contemporary interpreters to civil society issues explored.

     PO917      - Terrorism and National Security


     
      The purpose of the module is to develop an understanding of the complex relationships between terrorism, counter-terrorism efforts, and human rights, both at home and abroad. Central to the module is the role of the state in responding to terrorism, in attempting to prevent terrorism, and in itself using and sponsoring terrorism. In this regard students are encouraged to re-evaluate assumptions about the state and its place in domestic and international politics, focusing particularly on crimes by the state. Students will be introduced to competing approaches to the study of terrorism, many of which are grounded in wider theories and approaches common to International Relations and Security Studies. One of the challenges of the module is to think critically about the implications and consequences of those various approaches. The module will begin by looking at the various methodological, theoretical, and definitional challenges associated with the study of terrorism. Building on this grounding, students will then begin analysing terrorism, counter-terrorism and the role of the state through a number of case studies drawn from the 20th and early 21st Centuries. They will be encouraged to relate each of the case studies to the broader methodological and theoretical debates explored in the first few weeks of the module.

     PO918      - Regional Conflict & Security Analysis


     
      This module will introduce students to the study of regional security and conflict analysis, a subfield of security studies.  The first part of the module covers the main theoretical approaches to the study of regional security and the role of regional security organisations. These theoretical approaches will be contrasted to approaches focused on international security, and we will ask why it is valuable to study security at the regional level of analysis. Theoretically and empirically, the course will investigate the processes of regionalisation of security that have taken place since the end of the Cold Wars global superpower rivalry. It will also discuss how regional security integration can be achieved, and indeed whether such an achievement would be desirable from the perspective of promoting peace and security.After this general introduction, we concentrate on the security dynamics of four specific regions. The regions covered will be the Middle East, Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Thus, the empirical focus of the course is on regionalism in the developing world. The region-specific seminars will all have an empirical focus, but will combine this with the theoretical approaches discussed in the first part of the module. The aim is to understand the causes of conflicts in each region, through analysing the interrelationship between local, regional and international factors. One important task in that regard is to determine the relative importance of the regional level vis-&agrave;-vis those of the domestic (state) and international levels.  In the case of each of the three regions we will also investigate the role played by regional organisations in exacerbating or alleviating conflicts and insecurity.

     SO998      - Dissertation


     
      The aims of this module are twofold:First, to provide students with the opportunity to independently carry out an in-depth inquiry to investigate a research question(s) of their choice, producing a coherent review of the relevant literature, a logical discussion and a clearly communicated set of conclusions in the form of a dissertation.Second, to prepare students to become research-minded practitioners in order that they have the capacity to undertake research in practice settings and/or take a lead role in supervising others in such work.The following represents the likely format for curriculum delivery:In mid-November, there will be a two-hour workshop, which will outline the aims, the structure, the process of the dissertation. During the spring term, the students will finalise their proposal with their chosen supervisor. If the dissertation requires ethical research approval, an application will be submitted to the school research ethics committee by the beginning of the summer term. During the summer term and vacation, students will meet their supervisor every fortnight to discuss the progress of their dissertation. The supervisors will provide feedback on written work and will set monthly work plans and targets for the students. The dissertation topic will relate to a key question, issue and problem within social science.
