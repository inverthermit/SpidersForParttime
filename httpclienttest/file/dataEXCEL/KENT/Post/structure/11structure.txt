   BI850 - Practical and Applied Research Skills for Advanced Biotechnologists and


   
    The module aims to develop understanding and practical skills in biotechnology and bioengineering, based around interactive workshops, practical sessions, group work and a mini-project. The initial stages of the module will involve an intensive rotation of practical sessions covering key practical and transferable skills in molecular biology and biotechnology. These will be accompanied by interactive workshops and classes that review the theory of these techniques, and will use case studies to illustrate their impact and importance in both academic and industrial settings. These skills will be applied in a mini-project that aims to produce a biotherapeutic protein, from design stage through production, purification, characterization and functional analysis, using our state-of-the-art research facilities. Students will learn skills in experimental design using appropriate case studies that will embed them within the relevant research literature. They will also gain experience of analysis and statistical interpretation of complex experimental data. The module will also include visits to industries involved in biopharmaceutical production to experience these skills in manufacturing and practice. Key industrialists will also give invited workshops and seminars.

   BI830 - Science at Work


   
    SummaryScience has a profound influence on professional practice in the private and public sector. This module considers the ways in which different professions interact with science and scientists, and how this influences the work they do. Their interaction with the public will also be discussed. A series of  speakers with diverse professional backgrounds (education, industry, government, policy making, the law, the media) will describe their work, the role of science in the profession, and the way in which science influences their actions and interactions with the public and other professions. This will relate to scientific content in a range of scientific contents, including cancer, reproductive medicine, biotechnology and healthcare.  This will be illustrated by case studies presenting challenges and dilemmas concerning the communication of science in the context of different professions and their target audiences.Themes and Topics The nature of public understanding and public engagement The current science communication landscape: existing schemes, government priorities, charitable organisations Review of recent surveys on public attitudes to science, scientists attitudes to communication, and related studies in the public domain Analysis of published science communication activities targeting different audiences  Analysis of evaluation strategies from surveys of the published literature Case studies of science communication from practitioners in different professions: TV, science writing, media relations, politics, lobbying

   BI840 - Translational Medicine: from the laboratory to the clinic


   
    The harnessing of scientific knowledge in the treatment of disease requires a complex series of highly regulated studies that must be performed under highly-regulated legal and ethical frameworks. This module reviews the transition from promising cancer therapy to fully realised therapeutic agent, using specific therapies as examples. It will also discuss the emerging potential for personalised medicine based on patient-specific molecular biomarkers.

   BI852 - Advanced Analytical and Emerging Technologies for Biotechnology and Bio


   
    This module will consider key areas of analytical technologies used for the analysis of proteins, small molecules and cells. This will include mass spectrometry techniques (GC-MS, ESI-MS, MALDI-ToF MS), crystallography and NMR, spectroscopy (UV-vis, IR, Raman, fluorescence, ESR), chromatography, DNA and RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, microscopy (AFM, EM), electrophoresis, (qRT)-PCR, omics approachs, glycosylation profiling, cell based assays, simple fermentation control and measurements. Industrial case studies will be covered to demonstrate how different techniques and approaches are integrated in a commercial environment. Students will also be expected to design and implement a protocol aim at recovering and characterising a protein molecule from mammalian cell culture within set constraints and parameters. There will also be a visit to an industrial analytical laboratory to demonstrate such technologies in the work place. This will be delivered through workshops and seminars by specialists within the CMP and involve a number of course work assignments that will consider the most current research and thinking in these areas. This will be complemented by a one week practical where the students are asked to design a process to purify and characterise a molecule and then use this to setup a crystallisation screen.

   EL876 - Advanced Control Systems


   
    This module is concerned with the design of practical feedback controllers.  Feedback is used in a control system to enhance the performance of the plant or process, and to reduce the sensitivity of the system to uncertainty from external effects (for example, disturbance signals and noise on measurements) and model uncertainty (i.e. the difference between the assumed model of the process to be controlled and the actual industrial plant which is likely to be time varying and uncertain).  If the performance specifications are achieved in the presence of the expected uncertainties, then the control is said to be robust. This course will provide an overview of a number of techniques for robust control, with an emphasis on design and simulation to enhance learning.
