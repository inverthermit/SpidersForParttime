   LW562 - Criminal Law for Forensic Scientists


   
    This module seeks to provide a sound knowledge and understanding of the concepts and principles underlying the criminal law, including a grounding in its historical development and underlying philosophy; to provide a detailed grasp of key concepts and general principles; and to promote a critical discussion about the nature, function and effects of the use of criminal law in given contextual situations. 


    Credits: 15 credits

   LW573 - Law of Evidence for Forensic Scientists


   
    Module Details:The role of evidence in a courtroom is technical but its rules reflect core principles of the due process of law.  These are becoming more significant with the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 and it is important for forensic scientists, who may act as expert witnesses, to have an understanding of these rules and their operation in the trial process.  This module considers the position of forensic evidence within the trial process, rules governing the recognition of such evidence and the perception of its value in the trial.  In addition matters such as the function of the judge and jury, burden and standard of proof, and hearsay are considered from a central focus of how they relate to forensic evidence.

   PS720 - Advanced Forensic Project Laboratory


   
    The module is designed to give students experience of a range of advanced laboratory methods with wide application in modern Forensic Science.  These methods will underpin their Stage 4 Forensic Analysis and Incident Management Presentation (PS717) and research project (PS740) modules.The module will be in two sections.  In the first section, taught in the Autumn Term, students will receive training in a range of advanced chemical and physical laboratory methods.  This section of the module will be assessed by a report written on each experiment.   In the second section, beginning towards the end of the Autumn term and continuing throughout the Spring Term, students will select one of the methods for an extended self-directed project.  This will evaluate the application of the method in Forensic Science, and will include experimental measurements to establish the detection limit of the method in trace analysis.  This section of the module will be assessed by oral presentation and written dissertation.Experiments will include such as (NB this is an illustrative list):
Gas chromatography  mass spectrometryImportant example of modern hyphenated analysis techniques.  Used in analysis of accelerant and explosive traces at scenes of fires and explosions, also in analysis of drugs of abuse.  
Atomic absorption spectroscopyUsed in the analysis of trace metal content.  Experiment to compare flame and graphite furnace methods.
NMR spectroscopyUniversally used in analysis of organic substances.  Experiment to manipulate FID curves, to explore peak resolution and detect contaminants in samples such as counterfeit medicines.
X-ray fluorescenceUsed in analysis of metal artefacts, including bullet casings and forged coins.
X-ray diffractionUsed in analysis of materials with crystalline lattices, including metals and inorganic explosives residues.
Electron microscopySEM, TEM and Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) in the analysis of gunshot and explosives residues.
Raman spectroscopyUsed in forensic analysis of ink pigments, street drugs and counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
HPLCWidely used method of separating and identifying substances in forensic science.
UV-visible/fluorescence spectroscopyUsed in comparison of pigments and paper in questioned documents; also chemical tests for explosives and drugs of abuse.
Image processingFacial recognition software, signature comparison, and the reconstruction of CCTV images.
