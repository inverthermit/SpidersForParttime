 For the term spent in Rome, you study the monuments and artefacts of the city at first hand, visiting relevant sites and museums. University of Kent staff are present for part of the spring term in Rome to ensure continuity of academic guidance and pastoral support.

The American University of Rome was founded in 1969 and runs a wide-ranging series of programmes in the arts and in business administration, including the subjects of archaeology, classics, and cultural heritage.
