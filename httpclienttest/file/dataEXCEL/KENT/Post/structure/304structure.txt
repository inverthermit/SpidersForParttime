   SE801 - Theory and Ethnography in Social AnthropologyI


   
    This module aims to develop the anthropological imagination of master's students, that is, to instill the ability to apprehend theoretical issues and apply them with a critical and informed sense of difference in the human experience.  The module is not a 'history of theory survey; rather, it will proceed by means of a set of longstanding themes in social and cultural anthropology through which different theoretical approaches to the same ethnographic problem or issue have been explored.  The module may be organised around a single theme that has long dominated anthropological discussions (such as the gift, hierarchy and scale, structure and agency etc.) which will be used as a lens through which to view theoretical discussions within social anthropology as well as its appropriations from other disciplines.

   SE805 - Theory and Ethnography in Social Anthropology II


   
    This module aims to aid postgraduate students in making connections between theoretical issues and the ways in which they recur in the practices and debates of social anthropologists. The module teaches theoretical engagement by means of tracking the way that similar problems in ethnographic practice have been approached by different theoretical schools. The module engages a series of themes that illustrate how social anthropologists throughout the history of the discipline, and from different national traditions within the discipline, have each engaged with the pressing political and social concerns of their day.

   SE806 - Research Methods in Social Anthropology II


   
    Fieldwork is the hallmark of anthropological research. Its style and delivery, as well as the discourses surrounding it, have changed alongside the discipline. In his book Routes, Travel And Translation In The Late Twentieth Century, Clifford (1997) flags two important aspects of fieldwork: first, the formation of intensive interactions and relationships that produce "deep" cultural understanding in settings that can vary in time and location, and, second, a sense of displacement, movement or travel for the fieldworker thus allowing for an objective detached perspective. The ways in which anthropologists strive to interact with people while maintaining objectivity, make research ethics and methodological choices particularly important since their presence in the field has implications on the people whom they study.

   SE807 - Contemporary Ethnography in Environmental Anthropology


   
    Students will be expected to read eight ethnographies over the course of 24 weeks (one every three weeks).  A three hour seminar will be held to discuss the work. For each seminar, students will be expected to prepare, for evaluation, a book review of no more than 800 words.  In discussing each study substantive issues concerning the case studies will be highlighted. Theoretical issues will be raised concerning the representation of anthropological knowledge, book organization and writing styles, and the relationship between theoretical perspective and presentation. In addition attention will be drawn to the way fieldwork and ethical issues are presented and discussed in ethnographies.

   SE831 - Environmental Anthropology


   
    This module introduces some of the main theoretical approaches and some practical applications of the study of environmental anthropology (in particular, the cultural ecology of Steward, the concepts of carrying capacity and limiting factors as used in eco-systematic models, historical and political ecology, and new approaches deriving from post-modern anthropology). It considers some of the main cultural and social aspects of the human-environment interface, such as the relationship between social organisation and ecology; alternative forms of land use and management; the impact of processes of globalization on human interactions with the environment in a number of non-western societies; and the cultural dimension of human adaptation to the environment. The middle section of the module looks at five categories of subsistence strategy and the environments they occur in, foraging and hunting (in arid, arctic and tropical forest ecosystems), fishing (coastal marine environments), pastoralism (in grassland and arid ecosystems), low intensity and high intensity agriculture (in arid, grassland and tropical environments).  For each of these production systems we will also examine a complementary contemporary issue in conservation and/or development. These issues may involve great debates in theory, problems of methodology or issues in applying research results to solve practical problems.  Throughout the module we address methods and problems of applying research in environmental anthropology to related development, conservation and human rights issues, and in particular this year we look at adaptation to climate change among Indigenous peoples.Week 1  Theory and Explanation in Environmental Anthropology: Wildlife TradeWeek 2  Human-Nature Relationships: Cultural EcologyWeek 3  Ecological Anthropology: Complex Adaptive SystemsWeek 4  Historical Ecology: The evolution of Biocultural diversity?Week 5  Political Ecology and Environmental DegradationWeek 6  Discursive Approaches: EnvironmentalismsWeek 7  Foraging societies, hunters, and the bushmeat tradeWeek 8  Fishers, Sea Tenure, and Common Property RightsWeek 9  Pastoralists, Grasslands and Protected AreasWeek 10 Low Intensity Agricultural Systems: Swidden SystemsWeek 11 High Intensity Agricultural Systems, the Green Revolution and GM cropsWeek 12 Climate Change: Studying local knowledge and responses

   SO819 - Quantitative Data Analysis


   
    The module will provide an introduction to the use of Statistical Analysis within the Research Process. It will begin by introducing and discussing different types of measurement and the practical problems of data entry in SPSSW. After discussing basic data description and transformation the focus will shift to Exploratory Data Analysis and the need to examine the data carefully. Simple approaches to summarising data and distributions will then be examined. This will then be followed by methods to test research hypotheses through bi-variate and multivariate methods that are used extensively in the Social Sciences. The final part of the module will look at various issues surrounding the practical issues of quantitative data analysis, such as how to find appropriate data and about presenting research outcomes.

   SE851 - Gender and Interdisciplinarity in Anthropology


   
    Students will be expected to read a series of texts in relation to their investigation of how social anthropology has drawn on other disciplines (such as sociology, psychoanalytic theory, philosophy, and the history of science) to aid its understanding of gender as a basis for human social organisation.  Most of these texts are theoretical in orientation and aimed at postgraduates or professional readers (see Indicative Reading List below), and are intended to complement the more ethnographic readings of SE550 Anthropology of Gender.  Each reading addresses a particular problem in the impact of gender studies on anthropological thought, such as academic and political feminisms, sexuality, kinship, economics, and the distinction between what is natural and what artificial in the human experience.  Students will be required to relate these themes to ethnographic data in both the co-requisite module and in their other modules.

   SE854 - Lowland South American Anthropology


   
    Throughout the five hundred years of contact between Europe and the Americas, Amazonia has captivated the political, scientific and popular imagination of industrialized nations.  To many people in our society, "the Amazon" epitomizes the mysterious, the wild, the uncivilized - an image that anthropologists have variously exploited and criticized. Either way, they usually describe Amazonian societies as being either isolated from or opposed to "civilization" (i.e. the capitalist state). As Amazonians are incorporated into the nation-state and the global economy, however, it has become impossible to view them as either isolated or silent. Today, there is increased interest and concern relating to the place of humans in the environment and the future of indigenous peoples and the areas in which they dwell.This course will employ several classic ethnographic studies of South America  by anthropologists, such as Claude Levi-Strauss, Pierre Clastres, Philippe Descola, William Fisher, Neil Whitehead and Michael Taussig  to examine how the Amazon has inscribed itself on the imagination of anthropologists, as well as how anthropologists have used their experiences in non-Western societies to contribute to broad debates in Western philosophy. Ethnographic case-studies will provide the basis for discussing issues of theoretical and topical importance, such as environmentalism; political ecology, ethnogenesis, gender relations, kinship and exchange. Ultimately, this engagement challenges some of the most basic categories of our discipline: "the state," "society," and "culture."

   SE859 - Visual Anthropology Theory


   
    This module is a general introduction to visual anthropology. It includes treatment of cross-cultural cognition and symbolic analysis, the contextualisation of the visual within the wider sensorium, the social history of still photography and film relating to ethnographic subjects, the process of ethnographic filmmaking in terms of wider debates related to intersubjectivity, the study of national and regional cinematic traditions (outside Europe and America), the politics and efficacy of indigenous media, the contexts of visual advocacy and activist filmmaking, the nexus of the visual and medical and  the comparative ethnography of television and broader consideration of issues of social representation and political ideology in visual imagery. The module combines empirical ethnographic analysis of these issues with the alternative (complementary) contributions of scholars of visual imagery from a literary and humanistic tradition of interpretation.

     SE861      - The Ethnography of Central Asian Societies


     
      The course covers ethnographies of western Asian societies ranging from Pakistan through Central Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and ex-Soviet Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan) to the Caucasus. It introduces the history of civilization and Turco-Persian cultures in this region, its history of orientalist (philological) scholarship, and modern fieldwork. Thematic topics include: tribe and state, peasant and urban economies, family and marriage, codes of prestige and etiquette, sexuality and seclusion, religion and experience. A primary focus is on Central Asian Islamic religion and civilization, but minority faiths (Zoroastrian, Bahai, E. Christian, pre-Islamic traditions) are treated together with modern predicaments of secularization and political fundamentalism. Students are also encouraged to study modern cinema films and narrative literature from this region.

     SE862      - The Anthropology of Eating


     
      Students will learn about the significance of food production, trade and consumption in relation to cultural evolution, globalisation, identity and health. The module will cover different modes of food production, the domestication of animals and the cultivation of staple crops in the course of social development. It will look at different theories about the importance of food production for the rise of urban cultures and organised religion, and the relationship of food production systems to trade, colonial expansion and the process of globalisation. Moving from production and distribution to eating itself, the module will cover notions of food identity at collective and individual levels, by looking at the process of food preparation and consumption and abstinence in different cultural settings. We will also look at various forms of disordered eating, the dynamic relationship between cultures and eating and contemporary debates over fast food, genetic engineering, and personal identity against the background of rising food prices, regional food shortage and the management of famine in different countries.

     SE863      - Advanced Topics in Medicinal Plants


     
      This module is an introduction to ethnopharmacology, a multidisciplinary field of study that employs ethnobotany, chemistry, ecology, biology, pharmacology and anthropology to evaluate and understand the use of plants (and other substances) as medicines.  While students will be introduced to all of the disciplines involved in ethnopharmacological research, this module will have a heavy ethnobotanical and anthropological focus.  Lecture and reading materials will address questions related to the actions of natural products in the human body, the ecological and evolutionary basis of medicinal plant use, the epistemology and social organization of various medical systems, the efficacy of medicinal plants, the development of pharmaceuticals based on traditional medicines and the control of botanical drugs.

     SE864      - Medical Anthropology


     
      The module addresses the causes, effects, treatments and meanings of health and illness.  Health and illness are of major concern to most of us, irrespective of our cultural, social and biological contexts. In this module we will begin with an overview of the major theoretical paradigms and methods in medical anthropology.  We will then focus on how and why different diseases have affected various human populations throughout history and the ways perceptions of what constitutes health and illness vary greatly, cross-culturally as well as within one particular cultural domain.  This will be followed by an overview of ethnomedical systems as a response to illness and disease.  Anthropological studies in the sphere of medicine originally tended to concentrate on other peoples perceptions of illness, but have increasingly come to focus on the difficulties encountered when trying to define what constitutes health in general.  Anthropology has also turned its attention to a critical examination of biomedicine: originally thought of as providing a value free, objective and true assessment of various diseases (epidemiology), biomedicine is now itself the subject of intense anthropological scrutiny and is seen as the expression of a culturally specific system of values.  The module will finish with the consideration of practical applications of medical anthropology.

     SE865      - Ethnography of the Pacific


     
      The societies of the Pacific, encompassing the regions of Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia and Australia, have long attracted anthropologists to the diversity of its peoples and the complexity of their social worlds.  From classic studies of kinship, gift exchange and cargo cults to more recent work on the colonial encounter, gendered relations, and discourses of economic development, Pacific ethnography has perennially challenged anthropologists assumptions about the conception and composition of persons and their relationships.  In this module we will combine the close reading of ethnographies from the Pacific with a consideration of the relationship between ethnography and theory for this part of the world.  The Pacific has moved from a locus of early 20th-century research on societies presumed by anthropologists to be isolated and savage, to a fertile ground for considering the complex relationship between colonial and missionary history and the issues faced by Pacific peoples in the current era.

     SE866      - Social Computing Research


     
      In the module you will learn how people are using social computing resources, how anthropologists and others understand these activities, how to access and deploy these resources yourself, and how to leverage your participation to better understand social and cultural processes that are underway in social computing contexts. In Social Computing we describe and analyse how people use and adapt new technologies to form and navigate cultural and social contexts, create and spread knowledge and undertake action emerging from computer-enhanced capabilities. Capabilities include the internet (including so called Web 2.0), clouds, augmented reality, robotics and virtual devices, wearable computers and sensors and artificial intelligence.We begin by looking at the major theoretical paradigms and methods that have guided research on these in anthropology and related disciplines. In the remainder of the module we examine case studies of social computing based on different capabilities, using a tool-kit that supports the creation and analysis of social computing capabilities and developing group and individual contributions to an on-going collective module project that will contribute to the Social Computing context. Topics considered include the creative commons of open source, Web 2.0 and resource clouds, social networks, organisational change, reputation, social, legal and ethnical issues, mobile and ubiquitous computing and augmented reality. Topics discussed in class will provide ideas and models for student research projects.

     SE867      - Dialogues between Law and Anthropology


     
      Students will be expected to read a series of texts in relation to their investigation of how social anthropology and law have drawn upon each others theoretical and methodological insights over the past century and a half.  Most of these texts are theoretical in orientation and aimed at postgraduates or professional readers (see Indicative Reading List below), and are intended to complement the more ethnographic readings of SE590 Anthropology of Law.  Each reading addresses a particular problem in the consideration of legal practices by anthropologists, including courts and their specialised language, legal consciousness, legal pluralism, and peoples negotiations of border zones, war zones and other legally ambiguous spaces.  Students will be required to relate these themes to ethnographic data in both the co-requisite module and in their other modules.  The module will be an optional one within the programmes to which it contributes, and as such will provide the opportunity for students in different Masters programmes to identify issues which they share in relation to the problem of gender as an arbiter of theoretical difference and ethnographic description.

     SE868      - Anthropological Approaches to Business


     
      The module sets forth that anthropology has an important role to play in the examination of our own organizational lives as embedded in various forms of capitalism. This module will allow students to gain anthropological perspectives on business formations, structures, practices and ideologies. Businesses  be they individuals, families, corporations, nation-states or multi-lateral corporations - have identities that are invariably distinct from one another and which are forged upon and promote particular social relationships. Ethnographic case-studies, with a strong emphasis on the stock market in the second half of the course will provide the basis for discussing how these social relationships, that enact power, are embedded in broader cultural processes such as ethnicity, nationalism, migration, and kinship as well as ideologies of gender, aesthetics and religion to name a few. Acknowledging the multiple dynamic relationships between businesses, people and marketplaces will allow us to evaluate their roles as reactive producers, consumers and disseminators of cultural processes within our surrounding environments, extending from the local to the global.

     SE860      - Southern Mediterranean Societies (Mashriq andMaghreb)


     
      The northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean have been involved in a 'constitutive' relationship since traffic across the 'inland sea' began. This module, ideally but not necessarily paired with Anthropology's 'Northern Mediterranean Societies' module (SE548), opens with a consideration of that formative tension, both in popular and academic thought more generally (from Pirenne's 'Charlemagne and Mohammad' to Huntingdon's 'Clash of Civilisations') and in anthropology more particularly, with attention to the history and theorisation of the Anthropology of the Middle East and the Anthropology of Islam in relation to 'Mediterranean Anthropology'.In the following weeks a number of themes -- gender, honour, tribes and families, rural and urban life, popular and institutional religions, writing and recitation, modernity -- will be unpacked with a dual reference to the anthropological literature on the general topic paired with specific instantiation in ethnographic studies linked to core areas in the curriculum.In the closing weeks the course will take up core issues of contemporary political and cultural concern -- fundamentalisms, terrorism, dynastic dictatorship among them -- and seek to elaborate both continuities and discontinuities with the themes treated in the preceding weeks as well as with those treated in other domains of anthropology. The final session will look at the question of how to write ethnographies of the Southern Mediterranean today and will seek to show students that Southern Mediterranean anthropology, whilst seeming (as Gilsenan says) 'very much like a camel', is nonetheless unmistakably very much part of the family of contemporary anthropologies.

     SE840      - Contemporary Issues in Ethnobotany


     
      This module grows out of the enormous possibilities and challenges presented to ethnobotanists and environmental anthropologists during the twenty-first century: both to the huge potential created by cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural exchange, and to the enormous challenges that emerge as academia becomes increasingly accountable to a wider range of interests, problems and stakeholders amidst today's planetary crisis. It focuses on the multi-dimensional, complex and dynamic aspects of ethnobotanical, ethnoecological and human-environmental relations, with a special emphasis on the complex social roles and responsibilities of the subfields of ethnobotany and environmental anthropology. Drawing on recent articles and case-study materials from a diverse range of disciplines and perspectives, the module seeks to critically assess some of the key contemporary, at times controversial, issues relating to the material, symbolic, ecological, economic, cultural, historical, institutional and political dimensions of human-plant and human-environment relations.Topics covered include:-The multidimensionality of human-plant interactions-Approaches to ethnobiological variability and complexity-Ethnobotany, socio-environmental change and globalisation-Ethnoecology and symbolic ecology-Ethnobotany, ethnoecology and historical ecology-The chemical ecology of human-plant interactions-Plants, profit, property and power-Complexity, resilience and adaptive management-Agrobiodiversity, food and subsistence-Ethnobotany and forest product development-Conservation and environmental governance-Cultural landscapes

      Throughout the terms preceding the initiation of the dissertation module students will be encouraged by their supervisor and the instructors of other modules they take to develop ideas for their dissertation research project. They will also be taught appropriate research methods. The final essay of their pre-dissertation work will draw together materials they have learned through the preceding terms and will synthesise these with students' research interests in order to set up a prospectus for the thesis proposal itself. Students will be passed into the dissertation module by the examiners meeting on the basis of a pre-presented written plan for their research project prepared under supervision by their tutor and modified in relation to questions and comments raised by staff and fellow students during the research presentation day. Subsequent to this, the student will intensively discuss methods of data collection, theoretical models for the analysis of this material, and the use and integration of research methods into both its preparation and its final presentation with his or her supervisor and other concerned members of staff. . The student will then independently work on the thesis over the summer until mid-September when it will be submitted. Throughout this time the student will be able to gain supervision through electronic mail.
