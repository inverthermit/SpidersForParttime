Course structure


Research programmes involve writing a thesis on a particular topic with specialist supervision. You are given research training, which is tailored to the particular needs of your research and takes into account any training you have previously received. You also have opportunities to attend modules on relevant subjects on a non-assessed basis to fill any gaps in your background.

The curriculum will be in the general area of medicine and health sciences and may range from basic research into mechanisms of disease or methodology,  clinical research, or behavioural social science research.   Candidates will be required, in consultation with their supervisors, to undertake appropriate background reading;  to undertake such research training as the supervisor and the Social Sciences Faculty require and to put such training into practice;  to  carry out a substantial body of original research, and to provide a written account of the research  including its context within the current body of knowledge.
