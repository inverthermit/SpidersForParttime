 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.

   TZ863 - Service issues in Intellectual and Development Disabilities


   
    The aim of this module is to give students an understanding of organisational issues involved in learning disability services, including institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation, theories of normalisation and criticisms of these theories, methods of analysing quality of life and care and ways of producing change in services. This module is taught as a web-based guided study module with seminars at several points in the first term. For AIIDD students, this module is closely linked to the service placement and discussion and application of web-based units will occur during placement supervision.


    Credits: 10 credits
     (5 ECTS credits).

   TZ865 - Extended Essay


   
    All students will write one 6000 word essay on a topic which requires them to draw on material from the service issues, social psychology and behavioural analysis and intervention modules. This will be done over the course of the year for full time students and in the second year for part time students and will be submitted during the third term of the final year. 


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   TZ866 - Social Psychology of Autism by Distance Learning


   
    The aim of this module is to teach the basic facts about the nature and origins of autism, including definitions, epidemiology, biological, social and environmental causes. In addition, characteristics and needs of people with autism will be considered (including cognitive and social characteristics). All of this information will be set within the wider context of intellectual and developmental disabilities and students, although focusing primarily on autism, will be required to learn and know about these issues more widely. Over 50% of people with autism have a co-morbid condition and therefore this is an essential approach.


    Credits: 10 credits
     (5 ECTS credits).

   TZ830 - Research Methods


   
    The aim of this module is to teach students about research methodology and the knowledge needed to access and interpret the research literature. For those who take the statistical analysis element, the aim is also to teach appropriate statistical techniques for the analysis of quantitative data. The emphasis will be on methods of data collection and analysis which will be useful in practice settings, so that advanced multivariate techniques will not be taught.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   TZ867 - Case Study and Intervention Project (DistanceLearning)


   
    The aim of this module is to develop the students ability to assess, analyse and interpret information in a way that will support intervention to improve the quality of life of people with Autism Spectrum Disorders. 


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   TZ994 - Research Project in Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities


   
      During the first term of the course students will develop ideas for their research project and will be given the opportunity to choose a research project proposed and supervised by members of the course team or other Tizard staff (see Appendix 4 of course handbook for the list of topics for the current year). Students who choose to design their own project will be allocated a dissertation supervisor. Students following the MSc in Analysis and Intervention in Intellectual and Developmental Disability are required to do an empirical dissertation. All other students can choose between either an empirical or a non-empirical (e.g. policy or research review) dissertation. Students develop a proposal (assessed) for their research project with advice from their supervisor and apply for ethical approval either to the Tizard Ethics Committee (Ethical Review Checklist available on web-based resources) or to another ethics committee such as those in the NHS.  


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   Assessment

  
   Each of the four taught modules is assessed by a one-hour, web-based, multiple-choice exam and an extended essay. In addition, the Research Methods module involves short assignments and a worked problem. Placements are assessed by two 2,000-word service reports and one 4,000-word case report, plus feedback by placement supervisors.
