 Modules


 In 2015/16 the following core specialist module is available: EN852 &ndash; Colonial and Postcolonial Discourses. These should be considered indicative of the types of modules available, which may vary from year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.


 

      
   EN852 - Colonial and Postcolonial Discourses


   
    This module introduces you to a wide range of colonial and postcolonial theoretical discourses. It focuses on the construction of the historical narrative of imperialism, psychology and culture of colonialism, nationalism and liberation struggles, and postcolonial theories of complicity and resistance. The module explores the benefits and problems derived from reading literature and culture by means of a postcolonial and postimperial lens. Through the study of crucial texts and events, both historical and current, the module analyses the birth of imperialist narratives and their complex consequences for the world today.

   EN857 - Body and Place in the Postcolonial Text


   
    This module involves a materialist analysis of the dynamics of colonialism and postcolonialism, while at the same time problematising the assumed distinction between body and mind, or spirit. It is divided into three sections. The first section explores ethnic conflict and racism in relation to caste and class in postcolonial Indian society. The second looks at the economic deployments of the body of the master and the body of the slave. The third section examines the pairing of land and freedom in North African and Palestinian contexts.

   EN862 - Contemporary Arab Novel


   
    This module traces the development of the Arab novel from 1960 to the present, and examines the work of key novelists from around the Arab world (including Egypt and Iraq). It also examines Arab novels written in European languages, especially in English and French. It reads the novel in historical context, and connects it to questions of decolonization and emancipation, post-colonial disillusionment and political repression, war and fracture, and contemporary immigration. It also focuses on questions of literary form and interrogates the changing relationship between aesthetics and politics. The first weeks are dedicated to charting the emerging hopes of Arab decolonization after the loss of Palestine in 1948. These set the stage for questions of political and women's emancipation, especially in al-Zayyat's Egypt. With Mahfouz and Ibrahim, an internal critique of Arab decolonization begins to emerge from a social justice perspective. This is also registered on the level of form, where narrative disjuncture and individual alienation become more prevalent. The Arab novel here begins to introduce more modernist elements, while maintaining a predominantly realist framework. The following weeks ruminate on the disappointments of independence, and the emergence of social violence and political prison as tools of state repression. These mark a broader shift in the Arab world, which is captured by the Lebanese Civil War and the rise of the repressive Baath state apparatus. The Arab contemporary novel in Europe is also examined through themes of immigration and memory, faith, identity, and womens struggle against oppression.

   EN888 - Extremes of Feeling: Literature and Empire in the Eighteenth Century


   
    This module investigates Britons complex aspirations during the age of Enlightenment: wealth and politeness, adventure and the cult of sensibility, collecting rare commodities, seeking extreme experiences, discoursing on sympathy while owning slaves. What was the British empire that necessitated anti-colonial resistance? How did a backward island nation become an imperial power? We will explore fiction, travel writing, political theory and philosophy. Novels, Oriental fantasy, explorations of the Ottoman empire, Continental Europe, and the South Seas, and Black Atlantic writing (by slaves and freed people) will be featured. How did new styles of masculinity and femininity and new ideas about gender and sexuality emerge by means of urbanisation, global exploration, and mercantile capital? We will also reflect upon methods of historical recovery and approaches to texts of the past. The eighteenth century was a period of dynamic change and radical social upheaval that has left us with various legacies whose effects are still being felt today.

   EN850 - Centres and Edges: Modernist and PostcolonialQuest Literature


   
    Challenging the common centre-margin paradigm at the heart of postcolonial discourse, this broad-ranging and comparative module traces interconnections between modernist and postcolonial literature of the quest from different cultural locations and conjunctions. Just as the knights of the Fisher King legend set out to find the Holy Grail, both the modern and postcolonial self embark on individual odysseys in quest for origin, identity and language. Whilst the modernists experimentation with form evidences the sickness of modernity, postcolonial quest literature offers a reaction to a national schizophrenia: quest for self echoes a quest for a country, a language and a history. Conrads Heart of Darkness (1902), an early example of how the imperialist divide and centre-margin dialectic are handled, will mark the beginning of our exploration of modernist grail quests for an effective medium of communication, existentialist quests in a modern world in crisis, experimental quests into the unknown and poetic quests crossing thresholds of meaning. Primary texts will be read alongside recent critical work from a variety of mythological, philosophical, anthropological and theoretical perspectives.

   EN834 - Imagining India


   
    This course will trace the evolution of the images and perceptions surrounding the idea of India in British and Indian literature from the Mutiny of 1857 to the present day.  Through a variety of genres, including fiction, film and painting we will explore the ways in which representations of India became important sites of conflict, fantasy and dialogue between Indian and British writers in the late colonial period.  We will then go on to consider how these discourses were co-opted, questioned and re-visioned after Independence by successive generations of Indians negotiating the rapidly changing idea of the nation.  The course will be centred largely (but not exclusively) on works written in English and will question what it means to translate cultures, languages, and national vocabularies  what is lost and gained in the act of literary appropriation and exchange, and how history is shaped in the process.

   EN889 - Literary Theory


   
    On this module we conduct a broad survey of modern literary and critical theory, but in a revisionist spirit, asking what were the moments that generated certain critical turns, and examining the broad historical impetus of change, such as the Russian Revolution, the Cold War, and the revolts of 1968. In the first part of the module we look at developments in the early twentieth century which gave shape to modern literary studies; in the second part of the module we look at developments from the second half of the century to the present day. As well as reading the texts of theory, we aim to understand its historical and institutional contexts, and our overall objective is to understand and analyse some of the recent turns in critical discourse, such as transnationalism, and the turn away from theory to the archive.

   EN897 - Advanced Critical Reading


   
    This module is designed to help you extend and develop your skill, enjoyment and confidence as a reader of critical and theoretical texts. We will reflect on the pleasures and challenges of the reading process as we work slowly through a single major essay. As we go we will focus on exciting, complex or important passages, taking time to follow up references and footnotes, identify important themes and ideas, consult works of art and writings that share those themes, explore what the essay means for us and how it goes about the game of thinking. The module is designed to help you come away with an in-depth knowledge of the essay and the texts and ideas surrounding it, and a deeper understanding of how you read. Our ten weekly seminars will function as a two-hour guided reading-group. Seminars will incorporate short student presentations introducing a particular passage, or otherwise focusing on issues raised by the main text or on relations between these issues, the main text and supplementary reading. Total study hours: 20 per week. Students will be assessed on a piece of written work of 5-6,000 words presented at the conclusion of the module on a topic agreed with the teacher.In 2015-16 the central text is 'Aphorism Countertime,' by Jacques Derrida.'Aphorism Countertime' was first published on the occasion of a new production of Romeo and Juliet in Paris in 1986. As well as finding out about about aphorisms, time and mistiming as Derrida's thinking frames them, we will read Shakespeare's play, study Freud on why we make mistakes, excerpts from the philosophy of Hegel and Husserl and discuss stories and films that explore timing, love, fate and near-misses. Aphorism: Any principle or precept expressed in few words; a short pithy sentence containing a truth of general import; a maxim.

   MT864 - Reading the Medieval Town:  Canterbury, an   International City


   
    This course will focus on a number of inter-related themes which will be studied through differing types of evidence from written and printed texts to objects and standing buildings. Consequently, certain seminars will take place outside the seminar room, looking at the evidence in situ. Topics will include the medieval topography, civic governance, urban defence, house and household, commercial practices and premises, parish church development, the place of religious houses, pilgrimage and city-crown relations, as a way of examining issues such as space, power, patronage and responses to changing social, political and economic conditions. Students will be encouraged to think comparatively, both nationally and internationally, to assess Canterburys place within medieval European society.

     EN865      - Post-45: American Literature and Culture in the Cold War Era


     
      This module is designed to introduce postgraduates to high level research in the field of post-45 American literature and culture, spanning the period from the end of World War Two to the late twentieth century. Proceeding in chronological fashion, it will address key issues such as the cultural Cold War, Black Power, feminism and cosmopolitanism through the close analysis of cultural items in their historical moment. These will include texts such as novels by Ralph Ellison and, Thomas Pynchon; essays by Susan Sontag and Joan Didion; cultural criticism by Clement Greenberg and Lionel Trilling; and sociological analysis by C. Wright Mills. In addition, painting and film will be discussed where appropriate. Students will be encouraged to approach and understand aesthetic texts and objects both on their own terms and in relation to broader historical phenomena such as shifting geopolitical configurations, changing race and gender relations, and the rise of neoliberalism. Ultimately they will be in a position to address fundamental questions about the nature and function of "culture" itself in the period. Throughout the module, students will also explore the latest research in the field, reading influential contemporary scholarship and acquainting themselves with salient critical debates concerning methodology, including those over the sociology of culture, the demise of postmodernism as a critical paradigm, and periodization.

     EN866      - The Awkward Age: Transatlantic Culture and Literature in Transition, 18


     
      This module explores the affinities, disjunctions, and dialogue between American, British, and Irish literary traditions from 1880 to 1920. The turn of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth gave writers on both sides of the Atlantic an acute sense of epochal drama and self-consciousness: they brooded over ideas of decadence, apocalypse, progress, revolution, and the nature of the zeitgeist; heralded endings, transitions, repetitions, reversals, and beginnings; and explored the ambivalences and confusions provoked by the idea of the 'modern'. We will pay particular attention to how writers conceptualise and represent history and time, and seek to anatomise the varieties of pessimism, nostalgia, and utopian thinking that the turn of the century inspired. This module focuses on texts by both canonical and non-canonical writers that often fall through the cracks of conventional literary history because they were published in the 'awkward age' and are often considered neither solidly Victorian nor yet programmatically modernist. We will interrogate standard national narratives of literary history (in the case of Britain, the compartmentalisations of the fin de si&egrave;cle and the Edwardian, and in the case of America, those of the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era), as well as the assumption that national literary traditions were distinct and coherent in the period. We will consider how American, British, and Irish writers reckoned with the forces shaping transatlantic intellectual and cultural life, especially post-Darwinian science, imperialism, socialism, feminism, and cosmopolitan ideals of culture. We will also consider how writers made the awkwardness of the age not simply a thematic preoccupation but a complex aesthetic challenge, prompting innovations as well as efforts to sustain the ideal of a literary tradition.

     EN872      - Provocations and Invitations


     
      This module introduces the challenges and pleasures of postmodern poetry and poetics. We will consider a range of poetic texts, and essays on poetry, that between them raise profound questions of nation, agency, language, politics and gender in the post-war period. Starting with Charles Olsons groundbreaking inquiries into open field poetics, we will investigate a range of American and British poets for whom the poem has been a way of generating new modes of thought and life. In particular we will explore the ways in which poetry of the period enables us to think through the implications of globalization. We will consider how poetry can escape the constraints of place, and how it can imagine new forms of collective identity. Among the poets we will consider are:  Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Frank OHara, Denise Riley, Lyn Hejinian, J. H. Prynne, and Tony Lopez. The work of these writers will be read alongside contemporary philosophy and political theory, and will be considered in relation to other art forms, especially painting. Students on the module will benefit from the activities of the Centre for Modern Poetry, including regular readings, research seminars and the reading groups.

     EN836      - Dickens and the Material Culture of the Victorian Novel


     
      Dickenss engagement with the material culture of his age has long been recognised by readers and critics.  In her influential analysis of the English novels form and function in 1953, Dorothy Van Ghent identified his characteristic transposition of attributes as symptomatic of a world in which the qualities of things and people were reversed: people were becoming things, and things ... were becoming more important than people. At the same time, critics have long noted the way in which Victorian novelists have used things to achieve that solidity of specification associated by Henry James with narrative realism. More recently, following on from the sesqui-centenary of the Great Exhibition in 2001, much study has been devoted to the so-called Victorian exhibitionary complex and the emergence of thing theory has brought new attention to what objects can tell us about the culture and society of the Victorians and their developing response to modernity. This module explores the engagement of selected mid-century fiction and journalism with Victorian material culture and introduces students to some of the key works in this developing field. It will examine the materiality not only in but of these these texts; the implications of serialization; the relationship between literature and journalism; and, through a visit to one of the Dickens Museums (in Kent or in London), some consideration of what its objects and artefacts may contribute to an understanding of Dickens and Victorian culture.

      'Reading the Contemporary' is a cross-disciplinary module the aim of which is to find out what it means to read the contemporary period through its aesthetic practices. The module will be co-taught by staff from the School of English, the School of Arts and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, with seminars alternating between the Canterbury campus and the ICA (London).The module has three main objectives. First, it will consider what it means, in a theoretical sense, to think about our contemporary moment. Second, it will address key themes and issues in contemporary culture and will consider how they bear on and are shaped by recent aesthetic forms. Third, through the seminars delivered at the ICA, which will arise directly out of the ICA's programme, students will be introduced to examples of current aesthetic practice.

Some attempt will be made to consider American Modernism in the wider international context; suggested reading in European Modernism is appended to this reading list.The seminar programme is arranged along chronological lines; we can, however, adjust our 'itinerary' according to student interests. Well take reading weeks at some point in mid-term (in consultation with students in the group) and in the final week of term, week 12 (when youll need time to work on your essays).

     EN832      - Hacks, Dunces and Scribblers: Authorship and the Marketplace in the Eig


     
      This module explores the construction and contestation of authorship between the publication of Alexander Popes brilliant Grub Street satire, The Dunciad (1728) and of James Boswells Life of Johnson (1791). In this period, notions of authorship underwent significant change as the image of the author as craftsman (or less flatteringly as tradesman) gave way to the image of the author as original creator or genius  an image that still informs our understanding of authorship to this day. Through an exploration of a wide variety of novels, satires, periodicals, and biographies, as well as visual images we will explore how the modern authors fortunes were shaped by such factors as the decline of the patronage system, the growth and democratisation of the literary marketplace, the emergence of the woman writer and the labouring-class or unlettered genius.Topics for discussion will include the myth and reality of Grub-Street; the gendering of authorship; the relationship between authorship and nation; the economics of authorship; the birth of the literary critic; canon-formation; literary celebrity and scandal.
