   FI820 - Independent Project Development


   
    This module provides advanced knowledge of the creative and production management skills required to produce a full proposal for a short fiction film as well as pre-production and distribution planning. These professionally relevant skills are contextualised in relation to the ways in which rigorous critical analysis of film underpins practice and aids the development of an autonomous vision for the students developing films. Lectures, seminars and workshops alongside masterclasses from in-house film practitioners cover screenwriting, proposal writing, script analysis, casting, auditioning, rehearsing, directing actors, visualisation techniques, technical strategies, creative producing, scheduling, budgeting, production management, and distribution planning. By the end of the module, students will have completed a full proposal and distribution strategy and undertaken relevant pre-production tasks for the short film they intend to make for their dissertation.

   FI812 - Advanced Film Theory


   
    This course examines the historical trajectory of systematic writing about film. Topics include the aesthetic strategies of film in contrast with other arts; films relationship with reality; the interdisciplinary reach of Film Studies; and the particular kinds of engagement into which cinema invites its audience.  As a goal, the course should help students understand the major theoretical debates, empower them to better informed analyses, and challenge their assumptions about what film canor shouldbe and do.

   FI813 - Film History


   
    This course examines film history and historiography through case study. In carrying out this investigation students will be encouraged to work with archive and primary sources held in the library in order to help them to evaluate and contest received histories, which may be based on an aesthetic, technological, economic, and/or social formations. Through this investigation students will be better able to understand the role and value of the contextual study of film, while giving them the opportunity to research and write on an aspect of film history. The choice of case study will depend upon the expertise of the module convenor and is not restricted to a particular national cinema or period.

   FI815 - Film and Modernity


   
    This module explores the history of film in France, with a particular focus on the role and representation of Paris in cinema of the pre-World War II years. The module examines the medium of film, considering its specific qualities as an art-form and also the ways in which it is influenced by and influences other artistic and cultural forms from its beginnings in the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the establishment of the Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que in the wake of World War II. Each week we will be considering the other artistic forms that were being produced at the same time as the films that are the focus of discussions. Simultaneously, the module will expose the intimate relationship between the development of the modern city and the development of the cinema, with a particular focus on Paris and the ramifications of its modernisation. The module specifically seeks to assess the historical place of the cinema within the development of early twentieth- century culture in Paris. To this end our reading will range from the work of early French film theorists, through critical theorists, geographers, urban planners and cultural historians.

   FI811 - Conceptualising Film


   
    Conceptualizing Film will provide students both with an in-depth examination of certain key issues in film theory, as well as approaching them (predominantly) from a distinct perspective associated with an emerging 'paradigm' of theory, namely analytic philosophy of film. The module will be organized around a series of sub-themes within the general domain of the philosophy of film, including emotion and film, the aesthetics and ethics of film, the nature of photographic and filmic representation, and the ways in which films might themselves act as vehicles for philosophical ideas. Throughout the course we will also consider the different styles of philosophy and their relationship to film theory. Seminars will stress the importance of examining arguments with care and rigour, and will introduce students explicitly to certain formal philosophical 'methods' of assessing arguments (eg. spotting question-begging, understanding distinctions such as that between entailment and implicature, the use of counterexamples and thought experiments). The ability to acquire and put to use such skills will be central in students achieving module objectives.

   FI899 - Dissertation by Film Practice


   
    The Dissertation by Film Practice is designed to develop each students creative voice as a writer/director of film, their ability to contextualise and analyse their own creative practice and their ability to work as a crew member on films directed by others.  Throughout their studies on the MA Film with Practice, students will have developed their own film idea in relation to sound research strategies and advanced knowledge of Film Studies as well as developing the technical and production management skills required to realise their creative practice.  Under the supervision of an appropriate member of staff, students will then complete pre-production and production of their own film and the associated critical analysis. By also crewing on fellow students films, students will graduate with a range of skills that can be applied to future professional work or post-graduate practice-led research projects. 


    Credits: 60 credits
