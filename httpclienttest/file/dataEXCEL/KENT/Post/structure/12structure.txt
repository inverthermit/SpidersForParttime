Course structure


We also offer a conventional MSc programme by research and dissertation, in which you undertake a single, focused, research project from day one, and attend only certain components of our transferable skills modules. You can take the MSc on a part-time basis over two years. We also assign a Postgraduate Supervisory Committee to MSc students, to offer advice and keep a regular check on progress.

You can select topics for the MSc, MPhil or PhD from any of the research areas covered in the Research Areas section.
