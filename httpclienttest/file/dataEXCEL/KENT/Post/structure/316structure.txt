Course structure


 The International Business and Economic Development MSc  can be studied over one year full-time or two years part-time and is divided into two stages: eight taught modules (seven of which are compulsory) and a dissertation on either International Business or Economic Development.

All of our MSc programmes require some mathematical analysis, and we recognise that students have widely differing backgrounds in mathematics. The first week of all our MSc programmes includes compulsory intensive teaching in mathematics, refreshing and improving your skills in order to equip you with the techniques you will need for the rest of the programme.

Students who successfully pass the taught element of the programme, proceed to the dissertation stage, where you undertake a supervised project of your choice on a Business or Economic Development  issue. Advice on choice of dissertation topic and management is given during the taught stage of the programme. The dissertation stage develops students&rsquo; research skills and follows on from the Research Methods module. Student dissertations are supervised by academic staff.
