Course structure


 The theoretical aspects of the programme culminate in a practice-as-research project in which you explore ideas about comedy and comic performance through both traditional academic research and creative practice.  




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   All modules are compulsory.


 

      
   DR815 - Stand-Up: Comedy Club


   
    The module will provide a thorough exploration of stand-up comedy techniques at the forefront of professional discipline. Students will create and perform short routines, which they will use in regular performances in the low-key public context of Monkeyshine, a weekly comedy club set up for this purpose. As well as giving them a good deal of stage experience and allowing them to build up a body of tried and tested material, this will also give them the space to experiment and develop an individual voice, showing original approaches to stand-up.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   DR817 - Stand-Up: Experimental Comedy


   
    This project is better known as EXPERIMENTAL COMEDY. Throughout Spring Term, you will be engaged in research, investigating historical and/or theoretical aspects of stand-up comedy. This will culminate in a performance (perhaps recreating a historical style of stand-up; exploring the artistic possibilities of stand-up; or testing aspects of theory in performance); and an essay (which will present your findings in written form and explain how they informed your performance).


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   DR883 - Stand-Up Comedy: Reflect and Perfect


   
    Over the course of the academic year, you will be set tasks which involve reflecting on your own work, exploring the context of professional stand-up comedy, and engaging with relevant theory to develop your analytical skills. These tasks will lead towards a written assignment, in which you will, for example, reflect on aspects of your own performance, discuss the work of other comedians, accurately transcribe stand-up comedy routines, etc. The second phase of the module will move from written reflection to making practical use of this, employing the insights you have gained to revisit earlier performances. You will learn how to repeat and rework existing gags and routines, and how to structure a longer act out of them. The module will culminate with you performing a 15-20 minute set of this reworked material in a more prominent public venue, effectively a professional environment for stand-up comedy.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   DR995 - Dissertation Project:(MA-T)


   
    Throughout their studies on a taught Masters-course, students will develop and pursue an in-depth research into a specific topic, thus their potential as appropriate for a postgraduate degree. Students will start shaping and preparing their research early in the year, deciding at the beginning of Spring Term whether they will pursue Options 1 or 2 as detailed below. Students will present either their practice-based research or an academic conference paper in Summer Term at a postgraduate conference organised by the department, and they will submit their final dissertation script in September.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).
