   MA549 - Discrete Mathematics


   
    Recently, with the rapid developments in IT, in particular in electronic communication systems, some quite surprising new applications have been found for Discrete Mathematics (as opposed to the Continuous Mathematics based on the calculus). Thus methods for the encoding of information in order to safeguard against eavesdropping or distortion by noise have involved using some basic results from modular arithmetic, polynomial algebra and the theory of finite fields. The module will provide a self-contained introduction to this general area and will cover most of the following topics:(a)   Modular arithmetic, polynomials and finite fields: Applications to orthogonal Latin squares, RSA public key ciphers, coin-tossing over a telephone, linear feedback shift registers and m-sequences.(b)   Error correcting codes: Binary block, linear and cyclic codes including repetition, parity-check, Hamming, simplex; Reed-Muller - BCH - Golay - and other codes; channel capacity; Maximum likelihood, nearest neighbour, syndrome and algebraic decoding.

   MA574 - Polynomials in Several Variables


   
    This module provides a rigorous foundation for the solution of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  In the 1890s, David Hilbert proved four ground-breaking theorems that prepared the way for Emmy Noether's famous foundational work in the 1920s on ring theory and ideals in abstract algebra.  This module will echo that historical progress, developing Hilbert's theorems and the essential canon of ring theory in the context of polynomial rings.  It will take a modern perspective on the subject, using the Groebner bases developed in the 1960s together with ideas of computer algebra pioneered in the 1980s. The syllabus will be: Multivariate polynomials, monomial orders, division algorithm, Groebner basis; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and its meaning and consequences for solving polynomials in several variables; Elimination theory and applications; Linear equations over systems of polynomials, syzygies, discussion of Hilbert's Syzygies Theorem, its proof and applications. Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other applications.  Depending on time, these may include: invariants of group actions, linear PDEs, combinatorics and the Stanley-Reisner ring, and algebraic codes.

   MA576 - Groups and Representations


   
    Groups arise naturally in many areas of mathematics as well as in chemistry and physics.  A concrete way to approach groups is by representing them as groups of matrices, in which explicit computations are easy.  This approach has been very fruitful in developing our understanding of groups over the last century.This module will provide a rigorous introduction to the main ideas and notions of groups and representations.  It will also have a strong computational strand: a large part of the module will be devoted to explicit computations of representations and character tables (a table of complex numbers associated to any finite group).The syllabus will be as follows:(a) Groups: basic structure and examples (matrix groups, permutations), group actions;(b) A concrete approach to groups via representations;(c) Character tables: theory and computations for small groups;(d) Simple groups.Throughout the course there will be opportunities to discuss other topics.  Depending on time, these may include some of the following examples: Platonic solids, Sylow Theorems, invariants of group actions, combinatorics, groups and cryptography.

   MA577 - Elements of Abstract Analysis


   
    In this module we build on the key analytical concepts of sequences, series, limits,and continuity developed in any first course on Real Analysis, and place them in the more general context of metric spaces. In the first part of the course fundamental notions of metric spaces, such as compactness and completeness, are discussed. Metric space theory underpins much of modern anaylisis and its applications. In the second part of the course we use techniques and theorems from metric spaces to discuss elements of Hilbert space theory. The course emphasizes formal definitions and proofs, and aims to enable you to place your previous knowledge of anaylsis in a much wider context.The syllabus will be taken from the following topics:(1) Metric space theory.  Definitions and examples of metric spaces, normed spaces, inner-product spaces. Balls, boundedness, open and closed sets.  Convergence, Cauchy sequences, completeness, and equivalence of metrics.  Completion of a metric space, uniform convergence, and exchanging limits.

Limit points, closure, boundary, separability, density.  Banach contraction mapping theorem; applications to ODE theory (Picard's theorem), and/or integral equations.  Continuity in metric spaces, uniform continuity, and continuity of linear mappings.  Compactness, sequential compactness, Heine-Borel, Non-compactness of balls in infinite dimensional normed spaces.  The spaces of continuous functions C(X) on a compact metric space X, and the Weierstrass approximation theorem. (2) Basic Hilbert space theory.

   MA587 - Numerical Solution of Differential Equations


   
    Most differential equations which arise from physical systems can not be solved explicitly in closed form, and thus numerical solutions are an invaluable way to obtain information about the underlying physical system. The first half of the module is concerned with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Several different numerical methods are introduced and error growth is studied. Both initial value and boundary value problems are investigated.  The second half of the module deals with the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The syllabus includes initial value problems for ODEs, Taylor methods, Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, error bounds and stability.  Boundary value problems for ODEs, shooting methods and finite difference schemes.  Partial Differential Equations, difference schemes, iterative methods, stability analysis and the method of lines.

     MA963      - Poisson Algebras and Combinatorics


     
      The general topics of this module are Poisson algebras, their quantisations, and applications to combinatorics.Poisson algebras first appeared in the work of Sim&eacute;on-Denis Poisson two centuries ago when he was studying the three-body problem in celestial mechanics. Since then, Poisson algebras have been shown to be connected to many areas of mathematics and physics.  This module will provide a rigorous but example led introduction to the main ideas and notions of Poisson algebras and their quantisations. Specific applications will be to problems in combinatorics and to the study of totally positive matrices that are used in statistics, game theory, mathematical economics, mathematical biology.... This module will have a strong computational strand: a large part of the module will be devoted to explicit computations of symplectic leaves of Poisson algebras and to algorithmic methods in total positivity.The syllabus will be Poisson algebras: basic structure and examples.

      In this module we will study certain configurations with symmetries as they arise in real world applications. Examples include knots described by admissible diagrams or chemical structures described by coloring patterns. Different diagrams and patterns can describe essentially the same structure, so the problems of classification up to equivalence arises. This will be solved by attaching invariants which are then put in normal form to distinguish them. Review of basic methods from linear algebra, group theory and discrete mathematics; Reidemeister moves and the Smith Normal form of integral matrices; The Jones - and Kauffman polynomials, limits of classification; Permutation groups, transitivity, primitivity, Burnside formula and Polya-enumeration; Examples, observations, generalizations and proofs.

     MA966      - Diagram Algebras


     
      Roughly speaking, a diagram algebra has a basis consisting of some sort of diagrams and a multiplication coming from concatenation of diagrams. There is no formal definition, just a host of interesting algebras arising in different parts of mathematics and physics (for example the invariant theory of classical groups, algebraic Lie theory, knot theory, integrable models and statistical mechanics, quantum computing). First examples include the group algebra of the symmetric group and the Temperley-Lieb algebra. Although various examples of diagram algebras were known for much of the last century, it was Graham and Lehrer's definition of cellular algebras in 1995 which brought together many examples and ignited algebraists' interest in the subject. Exactly solvable Mathematical physicists have independently been developing and using diagram algebras as an important computational tool for a long period of time; the prototypical example of the Temperley-Lieb algebra was introduced in the context of statistical mechanics in 1971. It should not be a surprise that diagram algebras also play an important role in integrable quantum spin chains, the quantum counterparts of the classical statistical mechanical models. This course will give students two different perspectives on diagram algebras: from algebra and from statistical mechanics. The presentation will be example-led. The syllabus will include: (Associative) algebras and their modules: an introduction to representation theory; Examples of diagram algebras including the group algebra of the symmetric group, the Brauer algebra and the Temperley Lieb algebra; The origins of diagram algebras through algebra  Schur-Weyl duality; Cellular algebras  definitions, general theorems and implications for classes of diagram algebras. An introduction to statistical mechanics; The origins of diagram algebras in physics  the Potts model and the Temperley Lieb algebra, other examples of diagram algebras that arise in physics.

     MA970      - Nonlinear Analysis and Optimisation


     
      Suppose that we multiply a real matrix with a vector, but we replace the multiplication operation by addition and the addition operation by taking maximum. In this way we obtain a ``linear'' map in the max-plus (or tropical) algebra. The origins of this algebra lie in combinatorial optimization and in the analysis of dynamic discrete event systems, which are used to model transportation/communication networks and manufacturing systems. Like matrices, max-plus maps have a rich theory.Max-plus maps can be viewed as nonlinear versions of stochastic matrices. They lie within the framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, which is a nonlinear extension of the classical theory of nonnegative matrices. This point of view is very fruitful: it allows one to apply methods from nonlinear analysis, in addition to algebraic ones, and provides a broader perspective on max-plus algebra and its applications.This module offers a basic introduction to max-plus (or tropical) algebra and develops the connection with nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. It builds on standard undergraduate Linear Algebra and Analysis courses. Applications  will be illustrated by various simple practical problems in  combinatorial optimisation and game theory.

     MA972      - Algebraic Curves in Nature


     
      In this module we will study plane algebraic curves and the way that they arise in applications to other parts of mathematics and physics. Examples include the use of elliptic functions to solve problems in mechanics (e.g. the pendulum, or Euler's equations for rigid body motion), spectral curves of separable Hamiltonian systems, and algebraic curves over finite fields that are used in cryptography. The geometrical properties of a curve are not altered by coordinate transformations, so it is important to identify quantities that are invariant under such transformations. For curves, the most basic invariant is the genus, which is most easily understood in terms of the topology of the associated Riemann surface: it counts the number of handles or holes. The case of genus zero (corresponding to the Riemann sphere) is well understood, but curves of genus one (also known as elliptic curves) lead to some of the most interesting and difficult problems in modern number theory.    Review of basic results from complex analysis and topology; Riemann surfaces and plane curves in complex affine and projective space;  The genus of a curve: degree-genus and Riemann-Hurwitz formulae; Genus one: elliptic curves and their group structure; elliptic functions and elliptic integrals, with applications;  Higher genus: functions, divisors and differentials on algebraic curves; Riemann-Roch theorem; example: hyperelliptic curves.

     MA973      - Basic Differential Algebra


     
      Differential algebra is a relatively recent branch of algebra that exploits the analogies between systems of algebraic equations and nonlinear systems of (mainly ordinary) differential equations. The basic references are (1) and (2) below. The tools developed in differential algebra are useful for practical problem solving, but they must be used through computer algebra packages since computations can get very heavy. In this module, we will give special emphasis to the package  "DifferentialAlgebra" included in the Maple kernel. We will give a rigorous but example led introduction to the main ideas of computer algebra. The main applications to be discussed are the analysis of singularities and the simplification of nonlinear differential systems. As already indicated, the module will have a strong computational flavour: Students will explore concrete examples with the computer algebra system Maple, comparing hand computations with the results achieved by the full-blown algorithms and dispatching large computations to the package.
