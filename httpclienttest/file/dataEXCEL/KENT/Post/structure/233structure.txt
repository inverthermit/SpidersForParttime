    This module is an introduction to public archaeology as applied to the processes of managing archaeological sites. Public archaeology as a set of practices examining the impact of archaeology in areas outside its academic horizon, is specifically examined in site management, in order to review parallel practices around the world and seek hybrid tactics and strategies of identifying: local concepts and practices, interest groups, effective ways of inclusion and participation of the public, presentation and dissemination of archaeological information, impact and monitoring processes in order to produce a meaningful, ethically-correct and sustainable management plan or policy.Various examples are drawn from sites around the world, picturing ways that the public interacts with archaeological heritage and site management, the values ascribed by locals and various publics, methods of identifying and dealing with it and subsequently methods of inclusion or actions resulting in exclusion. Relevant legislative frameworks, political patterns and impact assessment of archaeological intervention are examined as well, in order to apply preventive and ameliorating strategies.

   HM817 - Museum Management


   
        The aim of this module is to introduce students to both museum and collections management. First students learn about the history of museums, starting from the early collections and first museums and ending with recent developments. Then the intention is, by exploring the pressures (financial, political and social) exerted in modern museums nowadays, to examine how museums use management and marketing to achieve their goals and serve their mission. Through theory and diverse case studies, students get acquainted with methods and ideas that museum experts have borrowed from the field of management and marketing and discuss the problems and prospects that arise. Students' understanding and awareness of museums' roles and responsibilities in light of funding cuts, the need of democratisation and professionalisation, and the increasing diversification of visitors' interests and demands will be further developed through guest lectures, field trips and practical exercises.


    Credits: 15 credits

     HM899      - Dissertation (Heritage Management)


     
      The Dissertation / Field Study Project module comprises supervised research undertaken by the individual student, or group of students, in the broad area of Heritage Management. Students will chose between an individual dissertation or a collaborative, market lead (i.e. organisations asking for specific topics) field study project. Thus the difference between a dissertation and a Field Study Project is the number of people involved  a dissertation is an individual piece of work, and a Field Study Project is carried out by a group working together.  A Curriculum will be developed by the student(s) around their own particular research interests. In the case of a dissertation there is one supervisor, in the case of the collaborative Field Study Project there are two supervisors, typically an archaeologist and a person from Business (AUEB).


      Credits: 60 credits
       (30 ECTS credits).
