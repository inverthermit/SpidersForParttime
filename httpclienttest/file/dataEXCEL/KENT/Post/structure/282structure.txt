For part-time students, in the first year you take  'Design of Social Research'  and 'Qualitative Data Analysis.'  In the second year, you take 'Quantitative Research'  and 'Using Research &ndash; Advanced Critical Skills'.  Additional credits will be obtained from optional modules offered within the Faculty.




 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year.  
Those students who wish to follow a sociology pathway should take optional modules that focus on sociology or social policy:



 

      
   SO817 - Qualitative Research


   
    This module focuses on the theory and practice of qualitative research.  It explores the various aspects of using and collecting qualitative data. The aim of the module is to illustrate a range of practical techniques while considering related problems of evidence and inference in qualitative analyses.Students will be versed in a range of techniques and will have the opportunity to practice some of them, this includes:  the theory and practice of interviewing and different varieties of interview;  focus groups;  oral history;  case study methods;  ethnographic theory and method;  action research;  critical discourse analysis;  narrative analysis;  visual methods.

   SO819 - Quantitative Data Analysis


   
    The module will provide an introduction to the use of Statistical Analysis within the Research Process. It will begin by introducing and discussing different types of measurement and the practical problems of data entry in SPSSW. After discussing basic data description and transformation the focus will shift to Exploratory Data Analysis and the need to examine the data carefully. Simple approaches to summarising data and distributions will then be examined. This will then be followed by methods to test research hypotheses through bi-variate and multivariate methods that are used extensively in the Social Sciences. The final part of the module will look at various issues surrounding the practical issues of quantitative data analysis, such as how to find appropriate data and about presenting research outcomes.

   SO832 - Critical Social Research: Truth, Ethics and Power


   
    This course provides students with the understanding and skills necessary to use research, whether within a research career or outside of it.  Building on other training in the details of specific methods, it focuses on two sets of broader questions.  Firstly, it looks at uncertainty in social research  how confident are we about what we know?  In answering this question it looks at issues of quality in qualitative and quantitative research, the difficulties of causal inference and generalisation, coming to conclusions from research reviews, and philosophical issues around truth and values.  Secondly, it looks at the link between research and action.  In doing this, it goes from the very practical (how to ensure that your research is used by policymakers and/or practitioners, and to deal with the political pressures on researchers) to the conceptual (in what ways does evidence get used by wider society?) to the normative (should researchers be critical, and if so, what are their ethical obligations in doing this?).

   SO833 - Design of Social research


   
    Module Summary: This module aims to provide students with the skills to develop a research idea and to turn this into a coherent, achievable  and interesting!  research proposal.  The course will be particularly useful for those doing empirical research in their MSc or PhD dissertation, or who will use social research after their studies.In developing these skills, the course also provides an introduction to research methods and methodological debates.  It will cover:1. Key skills in research design  developing a research question; writing a research proposal; and real-world considerations like ethics, cost, and feasibility;2. Qualitative research design  an overview of different types of qualitative methods and the logic of qualitative design; when to apply qualitative methods; and key design issues such as choosing cases and planning qualitative analysis;3. Quantitative research design  an introduction to the logic of quantitative research, and key issues such as turning the social world into numbers; when to apply quantitative methods; issues surrounding generalisation; how to interpret quantitative analysis results, and an introduction to the most common form of quantitative analysis;4. Mixed-methods designs, which combine qualitative and quantitative research. This course is complementary to the specialist courses in doing qualitative (SO817) and quantitative (SO819) research, and the course Using Social Research  Advanced Critical Skills (SO832).

   SO869 - Theories of Crime


   
    In the late modern period we are presented with an extraordinary wealth of criminological theory.  Past and present paradigms proliferate and prosper. This course examines these theories, placing them in the context of the massive social transformations that have taken place in the last thirty years. It is not concerned so much with abstract theory as criminological ideas, which arise in particular contexts. It aims, therefore, to situate theories in contemporary debates and controversies and allows students to fully utilize theoretical insights in their criminological work. In particular we will introduce the current debates surrounding cultural criminology, the debate over quantitative methods and the emergence of a critical criminology.

   SO884 - Race, Difference and Belonging


   
    This module investigates and critically examines the ways in which understandings of race, racisms, difference, and belonging have shaped, both historically, and in the contemporary era, multiethnic societies such as Britain and the USA. This topic is especially pressing, given the vast amount of change in many Western societies - greater cultural diversity, globalization and greater mobility, changes in the manifestations of racism, and changing patterns of family and community life. In what ways do notions of race and racial difference, and contestations over belonging, still matter (or not) in societies today? What competing evidence exists in claims about either the continuing (or declining) significance of race and notions of difference more generally? Should we attempt to transcend race and racial thinking?

   SO877 - Key Issues in Comparative Social Policy


   
    This course focuses on key challenges for International Social Policy through systematically differentiating and analysing key fields and issues. In this way, the student is provided with a systematic overview of some of the main spheres in which international and national social policy agendas co evolve. Individual social policy fields include extended working life and retirement; health; social security, migration policy and social care; with related issue areas including social exclusion and urban policies. While many policy domains are under pressure to change in the context of common socio-economic and processes  including population ageing, globalisation, and international migration -the response to these pressures will vary depending on a number of internal and external socio-economic and political factors, whose configuration will vary markedly by country and policy field. The course follows and complements the first core module of the International Social Policy MA (SO872 International Social Policy). The two modules together form a cohesive and coherent approach to social policy from an international and comparative perspective, although the Key lssues module is also self-contained and accessible in its own right to students of other MA programmes

   SO878 - International Migration, Issues and Perspectives


   
    This module will provide an introduction to global migration in the 21stcentury. It will present theories of migration from a variety of disciplinaryperspectives and will relate contemporary migration to historical precedents.Throughout, we will approach migration from the point of view of individualand groups of migrants and relate them to the often-divergent perspectives ofgovernments and institutional actors. Lectures will introduce students toimportant themes in the study of migration; to patterns of populationmovements and to the different streams of migration around the world. Inthis way, students will gain a solid understanding of migration as one of themost important global issues of today while, at the same time, learn aboutspecific examples of migration and policy response to migration through casestudies and real-life examples of migration.Teaching will use traditional lectures but students will be expected tocontribute to class discussion, drawing on their own experience and oninsights gained from their academic reading. We will use a broad range ofmaterials during the module and, as well as standard academic resources, wewill use grey literature, news reports, films and novels.As this module is being taught in an intensive block a workshop style will beadopted with more theoretical aspects introduced in the mornings followedby student-led discussion in the afternoons. Students will be expected toprepare for the next day sessions in the evenings and we may use lunchtimesto watch relevant videos together.

     SO881      - Cultural Criminology


     
      This module is concerned with developing a sophisticated understanding of the contested meanings underpinning crime and its control and the manner in which such meanings are intertwined with various different cultural phenomena. The module explores the complex patterns and sites of contest, control and resistance that bisect everyday life. This is achieved through engaging in a detailed consideration of cutting edge theory and research in the fields of cultural and visual criminology. The module will place criminality, policing, crime prevention, music, photography, emotionality, extreme sports, advertising, protest, war, physicality and the film in new and exciting contexts. The module equips students with the necessary theoretical tools and modes of social inquiry to make sense of a late-modern world permeated by crime and its control.

     SO882      - Young People, Crime and Place


     
      This module provides a critical understanding of young peoples involvement in crime and deviance and the various responses to youth crime, especially how young people are dealt with by youth justice systems. The focus is on the UK situation, analysis is also extended towards an international perspective. The module focuses on five key themes that are underpinned by analysis of the sociological, cultural and spatial dimension of youth crime. We begin by examining current trends in youth offending and explore media responses and then go on to look at the youth problem from an historical context. We will then go on to focus on the following key substantive themes; gangs, violence and territoriality; drugs, alcohol and night time economies; young people, urban space and antisocial behaviour; and the criminal justice response to youth crime.  Throughout the module, attention is given to the importance of understanding the connections of youth crime with race, class and gender and at the same time, engages with key theoretical ideas and debates that inform our understandings of youth crime.  Within the organisation of the module the content will include practical newspaper workshops where students will be encouraged to co-operate on issues based around the above themes and to participate verbally within the context of class discussions, group presentations and class debate.

     SO883      - Contemporary Social Theory


     
      Social theory is a nebulous field of inquiry with fuzzy boundaries. Some of the most significant contributions to it in terms of ideas and concepts have historically originated in the work of thinkers diversely identified with a wide range of disciplines - such as psychoanalysis, philosophy, anthropology, literary and aesthetic theory,  historical and cultural studies, as well as with sociology. This module approaches contemporary social theory by exploring a set of themes through close readings and analyses of several texts by 20th and 21st century theorists whose work has been to varying degrees appropriated across the social sciences and the humanities, but yet whose contribution to social theory per se is still open to question, in any case far from canonical.In working through these selected primary texts within a seminar group, the aim is to critically investigate and evaluate what they offer to social theory, and to critically assess their usefulness for understanding various social and political phenomena characteristic of contemporary life and society in a globalised world.  During the course of such detailed discussions, we will also, no doubt, reflect on the distinction between modern and postmodern social theory; the linguistic turn, the cultural turn, the ethical turn, the shift from narrative to image based culture, and other general parameters of social theorizing in recent times.

      This module will examine the ways in which violence is understood in social science research, and will provide advanced discussion of the major theoretical and research themes involved in the analysis of violence. It will critically examine data on the prevalence, nature and effects of violent crime, and will consider issues of violence, aggression and masculinity. This will be done with particular reference to examples, such as racist crime, homophobic crime and domestic violence. The module will approach violence from both interpersonal and societal perspectives and will include consideration of collective violence and genocide. It will further examine solutions to solutions to violence and conflict resolution, the effects of intervention strategies and non-juridical responses to violence.

     SO830      - Gender, Crime and Criminal Justice


     
      This module examines gender and crime in a globalised world. Several core themes inform the international exploration of crime, victimisation and justice, including 'race', class, age, sexuality, locality, economics, politics, power and discourse. The module offers students the opportunity to engage with a broad range of internationally classical and influential bodies of literature spanning feminist and critical criminology, masculinities theories, victimology, queer theory and globalisation. Men and women as victims and offenders will be examined through a gendered lens to assess how culture, discourse and identity function to enhance or diminish vulnerability to criminalisation, victimisation and injustice. Underpinning these analyses are notions of power, which prove central to considerations of the extent to which globalisation informs patterns of gendered offending, victimisation and access to justice.

     SO885      - Social Suffering


     
      In summary, social suffering calls for a new project of social science.  It involves researchers in the attempt to understand how social and cultural conditions moderate the experience of suffering.  It also brings a critical focus to the ways in which such experience serves to expose the moral character and structural force of society within peoples lives. Whilst attending to the particular ways in which individuals struggle to make the problem of suffering productive for thought and action, it also works to understand how, through to the level of collective experience, this contributes to wider dynamics of social change. This course examines these cross-disciplinary issues and debates with the aim of assessing their sociological significance and political implications.

     SO867      - Foundations of Sociology


     
      This course is designed to provide a guide to the foundations of sociology by exploring the most influential traditions of writing in the discipline and examining how these were forged on the basis of an ongoing dialogue with the legacy of the Enlightenment.  After situating sociology in its historical, philosophical and theological contexts, the course analyses how the founders of the discipline developed a series of a competing visions of those processes elementary to social and moral life.  Focusing mainly on the French and German traditions of sociology, but also incorporating the British tradition, we progress by examining the tensions that have arisen between collectivist visions of the social whole and competing conceptions of voluntarist inter/action, before focusing on Parsonss attempt to reconcile these approaches within an overarching conception of the sociological tradition. The second part of the course moves away from these classical visions of sociology to those post-classical attempts to reconstruct the discipline on the basis of alternative concerns such as conflict, culture and post-modernity. Here we study a number of perspectives that have contributed to a fragmentation of the discipline.  Whilst most sessions are concerned with debating the dominant theoretical interests that have defined the discipline, others are devoted to investigating key junctures in the development of methodology and research practice. The course aims to provide students with critical insights into the ways in which sociology has been configured as a discipline in response to key junctures in its history.

     SO998      - Dissertation


     
      The aims of this module are twofold:First, to provide students with the opportunity to independently carry out an in-depth inquiry to investigate a research question(s) of their choice, producing a coherent review of the relevant literature, a logical discussion and a clearly communicated set of conclusions in the form of a dissertation.Second, to prepare students to become research-minded practitioners in order that they have the capacity to undertake research in practice settings and/or take a lead role in supervising others in such work.The following represents the likely format for curriculum delivery:In mid-November, there will be a two-hour workshop, which will outline the aims, the structure, the process of the dissertation. During the spring term, the students will finalise their proposal with their chosen supervisor. If the dissertation requires ethical research approval, an application will be submitted to the school research ethics committee by the beginning of the summer term. During the summer term and vacation, students will meet their supervisor every fortnight to discuss the progress of their dissertation. The supervisors will provide feedback on written work and will set monthly work plans and targets for the students. The dissertation topic will relate to a key question, issue and problem within social science.
