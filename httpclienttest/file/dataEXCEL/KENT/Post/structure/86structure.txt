   GE804 - German Modernism


   
    This module has three main aims: to explore what was distinctively German about the Modernist era; to help develop the skills needed for the close analysis of poetry and poetic prose; and to consider how literary movements need to be understood in terms of their origins and subsequent development. Questions of both genre and literary movements will thus be addressed. Students will learn to read the poetry and poetic prose of this key period both thematically and stylistically, as well as how to place them in their political and historical context. As well as looking at some of the best known and most representative work of the period (e.g. Rilkes 'Duineser Elegien', Brechts 'Hauspostille'), it will also bring to light some lesser-known but equally important works (e.g. Gottfried Benns 'Morgue'). The various subdivisions of Modernism (Sprachskepsis, Expressionism, Surrealism, Neue Sachlichkeit), and the ways in which they combine to define the Modernist aesthetic, will be explored in depth over the course of the term.

   CP810 - Comparative Literature in Theory and Practice


   
    This module is designed to familiarize students with the history of Comparative Literature as an academic discipline, to develop their ability to analyse critically the major conceptions of Comparative Literature that have emerged over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and to enable them to apply theories of Comparative Literature in the analysis of literary movements, literary genres, literary topoi (such as the fallen woman), and literary figures who recur at different moments in literary history (such as Odysseus, Oedipus, Antigone, and Faust). Students will begin by studying a range of major conceptions of Comparative Literature, and will consider the implications for the discipline of Comparative Literature of theories of globalization, multiculturalism, translation studies, and world literature. They will then proceed to analyse selected literary works within the framework of these conceptions of Comparative Literature. The module will therefore combine a theoretical with a practical literary-critical dimension, encouraging close reading and an appreciation of historical context in the analysis of theoretical and literary texts.

   GE805 - Post-War Literature and Memory


   
    The module will follow developments in post-war literature from the period immediately after the war, where the terms of the discourse were defined largely by first-hand witnesses (Jean Am&eacute;ry, Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs etc) through to more recent work by Grass, Timm and Sebald. Questions of genre will be explored: is poetry, prose or drama better suited to a literature of remembrance? Theoretical questions pertaining to models of memory will also be raised, centering in particular on the Mitscherlichs seminal study 'Die Unf&auml;higkeit zu trauern'.


    Credits: 30 credits

   CP808 - Writing the Self: Autobiography in the Modern Period


   
    The notion of autobiography as a documentary genre, in which the writer unproblematically records the facts of his or her life, has been called into question by modern critical studies of the genre, many of the most important theorists of autobiographical writing insisting upon its central place in the literary canon, alongside plays, novels, and poems, with which it would share a certain literariness. Focusing on a wide range of modern autobiographical texts from different national and linguistic cultures, this module will treat questions of generic definition, form, motivation, and rhetorical strategy. Among the specific questions to be considered are: Can autobiography be strictly defined? How does autobiography relate to other literary genres such as the diary or the first-person novel? Is autobiography a particular kind of narrative? Is there an identifiable rhetoric of autobiography? Is sincerity a meaningful criterion when considering autobiography? What kinds of relationship do autobiographers attempt to establish with their readers? We shall also consider some of the recurring themes in autobiographical writing since the Romantic period, including the representation of childhood, the family, sexuality, gender, ethics, mortality, and politics.

   CP805 - European Modernism: Sexual and Textual Deviance


   
    This module investigates modernism as a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary phenomenon via close readings of a selection of literary and essayistic texts written in the early decades of the 20th century by a range of key European authors. After an exploration of the socio-cultural and historical contexts from which these texts emerge, we study the specificities of modernist literature by paying close attention to the formal and stylistic innovations which accompany typically modernist thematic preoccupations, such as deviant sexuality, the workings of the unconscious, self-reflexive thematizations of the specificities of the medium, new technological developments, the city, time, decay and a sense of metaphysical despair. Stylistic techniques such as multi-perspectivity, free indirect discourse, stream-of-consciousness, montage and fragmentation are explored not just as tools for rendering a dramatically altered conception of experience, but as formal expressions of the plight of the peripatetic modernist subject in their own right.The course will be taught in English. Relevant texts may be studied in English translation, but students with proficiency in European languages are encouraged to read texts in the original language.
