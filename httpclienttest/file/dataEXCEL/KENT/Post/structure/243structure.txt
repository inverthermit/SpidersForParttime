Course structure


 An understanding of Embedded System Engineering is vital to the design of most modern electronic devices and systems. Embedded Systems has a central role in computer systems, mobile and wireless communications, consumer electronics and automotive engineering and is important in the design of modern instrumentation and measurement systems used for industrial automation and manufacturing processes.

The MSc in Embedded Systems and Instrumentation at the University of Kent is designed to produce well qualified, competent engineers able to develop embedded systems using a variety of technology platforms in a wide range of applications including communications, consumer electronics, automotive electronics, industrial control, instrumentation and measurement.

The School has a world class reputation for research in embedded systems and instrumentation and has strong links with other research institutions and industrial organisations in the UK, Europe and the Far East which have helped the department apply its research to a range of   industrial projects including using microcontroller, FPGA, DSP and Custom Chip technologies.

It has developed novel solutions to a range of challenging engineering problems in image acquisition and processing, signal analysis, measurement and condition monitoring at high speeds and in harsh environments.

Activities have recently been broadened with the establishment of a control strand which is involved with the development of practically realisable control strategies that yield high levels of performance even in harsh and uncertain industrial settings. Such control strategies are often implemented in embedded systems.

 Modules


 The following modules are indicative of those offered on this programme. This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   EL822 - Communication Networks


   
    This module will take you through communication network protocols, as used in local-area networks and wide-area networks. It includes the protocols used in the wireless LAN (WiFi) standards, Ethernets, and IP networks. The analysis of network performance is also covered. A network simulator (OPNET) is used to reinforce the material, and to provide you with a means of visualising protocol operation and network performance.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL829 - Embedded Real-Time Operating Systems


   
    This module introduces Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and their implementation and use in Embedded Systems. The concepts of scheduling algorithms, threads, multitasking and inter-process communication are discussed in detail using practical examples and case studies. It includes advanced topics in Hardware/Software Co-design. Extended mini-projects are used to reinforce the material presented in the lectures.

   EL849 - Research Methods & Project Design


   
    The aim of this module is to prepare students for the Masters Project and for possible future research work. It begins with an introduction to MATLAB and SIMULINK tools which are used in most taught masters modules at Kent. The module also includes details about how to write a literature review and produce a viable project plan. Students learn how to use tools such as RefWorks and EndNote to produce and maintain reference databases. It also addresses important issues concerning the definition of a project and the consideration of ethical and Intellectual Property Issues. Techniques and guidelines for writing clear and concise English are discussed in detail.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   EL871 - Digital Signal Processing (DSP)


   
    In this module, you are taken through the fundamental of digital signal processing. The course includes a basic introduction to the representation and processing of signals in the digital domain and the design of digital filters. Application examples including JPEG and MPEG image and audio compression standards are used to illustrate the use of the theoretical material presented in the course.The course makes extensive use of MATLAB to enable students to grasp the subjects more readily.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL874 - Computer & Reconfigurable Architectures


   
    This module introduces some fundamental and advanced computer and reconfigurable computing architectures including CISC, RISC and VLIW. FPGA technology is used as the basis for describing different forms of reconfigurable computing architectures that are becoming increasingly important in many consumer and industrial applications. Specific emphasis will be given to the understanding of computer arithmetic architectures and methods which are used in the design of embedded systems. The module uses practical design examples using both C and VHDL to illustrate the material.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL875 - Advanced Sensors & Instrumentation Systems


   
    This module covers modern sensors and advanced measurement systems for a diverse range of industrial applications. General measurement principles and concepts are introduced. The module focuses on digital imaging based and intelligent measurement and monitoring techniques. Real life industrial case studies are included to enhance students learning experience in the design and applications of cutting edge instrumentation technologies.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL876 - Advanced Control Systems


   
    This module is concerned with the design of practical feedback controllers.  Feedback is used in a control system to enhance the performance of the plant or process, and to reduce the sensitivity of the system to uncertainty from external effects (for example, disturbance signals and noise on measurements) and model uncertainty (i.e. the difference between the assumed model of the process to be controlled and the actual industrial plant which is likely to be time varying and uncertain).  If the performance specifications are achieved in the presence of the expected uncertainties, then the control is said to be robust. This course will provide an overview of a number of techniques for robust control, with an emphasis on design and simulation to enhance learning.


    Credits: 15 credits
     (7.5 ECTS credits).

   EL890 - MSc Project


   
    A major practical system will be developed either in an industrial context or within the department.  There are no formal lectures - students will undertake the work in their own time under the regular supervision of a member of the academic staff and, where appropriate, industrial collaborators.


    Credits: 60 credits
     (30 ECTS credits).

   Assessment

  
   The project module is examined by a presentation and dissertation. The Research Methods and Project Design module is examined by several components of continuous assessment. The other modules are assessed by examinations and smaller components of continuous assessment. MSc students must gain credit from all the modules. For the PDip, you must gain at least 120 credits in total, and pass certain modules to meet the learning outcomes of the PDip programme.
