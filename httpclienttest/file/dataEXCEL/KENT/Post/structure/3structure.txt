   MA319 - Probability and Statistics for Actuarial Science


   
    The module will introduce the student to the basic concepts of probability and statistics, with applications to a variety of topics illustrated with real data. The techniques that are discussed can be used in their own right to solve simple problems, but also serve as an important foundation for later, more advanced, modules. After dealing with key ideas in probability theory, the module will cover descriptive statistics, before moving on to statistical inference - the science of drawing conclusions from data. A brief introduction to statistical computing will be included. Outline syllabus includes: Concepts and axioms of probability; marginal, conditional and joint probabilities; Bayes' theorem; discrete and continuous random variables; expectation; common distributions; numerical summaries of data; sampling distributions; point estimation; interval estimation and hypothesis tests; association between variables; goodness of fit.Marks on this module can count towards exemption from the professional examination CT3 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.  Please see http://www.kent.ac.uk/casri/Accreditation/index.html for further details.

   MA501 - Statistics for Insurance


   
    This module covers aspects of Statistics which are particularly relevant to insurance. Some topics (such as risk theory and credibility theory) have been developed specifically for actuarial use. Other areas (such as Bayesian Statistics) have been developed in other contexts but now find applications in actuarial fields. Stochastic processes of events such as accidents, together with the financial flow of their payouts underpin much of the work.  Since the earliest games of chance, the probability of ruin has been a topic of interest.  Outline Syllabus includes: Decision Theory; Bayesian Statistics; Loss Distributions; Reinsurance; Credibility Theory; Empirical Bayes Credibility theory; Risk Models; Ruin Theory; Generalised Linear Models; Run-off Triangles.Marks on this module can count towards examption from the professional examination CT6 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

   MA529 - Probability and Statistics for Actuarial Science 2


   
    This module develops the techniques introduced in MA319. The probability component of the module is mainly concerned with how to find probability distributions of functions of random variables, an essential skill in proving standard statistical results and in applying probability and statistics in novel situations. The study of sampling distributions, which underpin much of statistical inference, provides a bridge to the statistical part of the module. Statistical inference may be divided into point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing. All of these have been introduced in MA319. The present module extends the range of examples, and provides some theoretical justification for the choice of particular techniques in particular cases.Syllabus: Probability; joint distributions of two or more discrete or continuous random variables, marginal and conditional distributions, properties of expectations, variance, covariance and correlation. Generating functions: moment generating functions, probability generating functions, cumulant generating functions etc. The Poisson process. Methods for obtaining distributions of functions of one or more random variables. Approximate methods for transformations of random variables. Random number simulation. Sampling distributions related to the Normal distribution. Principles of statistical inference. Point estimation; properties of point estimators (unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency). Methods of estimation; maximum likelihood estimators, methods of moments. Hypothesis testing; Neyman-Pearson lemma, power function, uniformly most powerful tests, relative efficiency, likelihood ratio test. Interval estimation; construction of confidence intervals, pivotal functions.  Statistical inference for the slope and intercept parameters in simple linear regression.  One-way ANOVA.Marks on this module can count towards examption from the professional examination CT3 of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

     MA817      - Contingencies 2


     
      Life Contingencies is concerned with the probabilities of life and death. Its practical application requires a considerable sophistication in mathematical techniques to ensure the soundness of many of the biggest financial institutions - life assurance companies and pension funds. This module introduces the actuarial mathematics which is needed for this. The aim of this module (together with MA516 - Contingencies 1) is to provide a grounding in the mathematical techniques which can be used to model and value cash flows dependent on death, survival, or other uncertain risks and cover the application of these techniques to calculate premium rates for annuities and assurances on one or more lives and the reserves that should be held for these contracts. Outline syllabus includes variable benefits and with profits contracts; gross premiums and reserves for fixed and variable benefit contracts; competing risks; pension funds; profit testing and reserves; mortality, selection and standardisation. This module together with module MA516 cover the entire syllabus of the UK Actuarial Profession's subject CT5 - Contingencies.
