   FR866 - Literature and Theory


   
    This module will introduce students to a wide range of theoretical positions with the aim of enriching their understanding and appreciation of literature and critical practice.  We will begin with the thinking of Nietszche and Freud, before examining that of Saussure, Benjamin, L&eacute;vi-Strauss, Genette, Foucault, Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Kristeva, Cixous, and Irigaray.  As well as encouraging a critical engagement with the claims of the theories themselves the module will examine a number of representative theoretical readings of literary works. Students will learn to evaluate these various thinkers and use their ideas, as appropriate, in their own writing.


    Credits: 30 credits
     (15 ECTS credits).

   FR872 - Theories of Art in Modern French Thought


   
    This module examines a selection of pre-eminent texts in modern French art theory and philosophy. It invites students to analyse and to chart intersections and developments in French writing on the image across shifting critical landscapes, including those marked by phenomenology, structuralism and post-structuralism. Students will be encouraged to explore French theories of art with due attention to historical precedents, and to reflect on the aesthetic, political and technological significance of the visual arts for a wide range of French thinkers.

   GE804 - German Modernism


   
    This module has three main aims: to explore what was distinctively German about the Modernist era; to help develop the skills needed for the close analysis of poetry and poetic prose; and to consider how literary movements need to be understood in terms of their origins and subsequent development. Questions of both genre and literary movements will thus be addressed. Students will learn to read the poetry and poetic prose of this key period both thematically and stylistically, as well as how to place them in their political and historical context. As well as looking at some of the best known and most representative work of the period (e.g. Rilkes 'Duineser Elegien', Brechts 'Hauspostille'), it will also bring to light some lesser-known but equally important works (e.g. Gottfried Benns 'Morgue'). The various subdivisions of Modernism (Sprachskepsis, Expressionism, Surrealism, Neue Sachlichkeit), and the ways in which they combine to define the Modernist aesthetic, will be explored in depth over the course of the term.

   CP813 - Literature and Medicine


   
    This module is designed to introduce students to major works of modern fiction which address medical issues, whether these are foregrounded or incidental. The first part of the module will explore the rise of clinical, observational medicine in nineteenth-century France. The second part will examine literary representations of physical and cognitive disability in a body of twentieth- and twenty-first-century literature spanning several continents. The module will encourage students to reflect on the interface between medical and literary writing, and to contextualize these complex intersections in the scientific and medical writings of a specific period. It will also examine important medical issues such as pharmaceutical practice, mechanical orthopaedic cures, modern hospitalization, life-saving operations, and the role of medical staff in the physiological and psychological recovery of a terminally ill patient.

   FR807 - Postmodern French Detective Fiction


   
    This module examines a selection of French novels from the post-war period to the present day. Each of these novels employs the tropes of detective fiction as part of a wider literary project. The module invites students to analyse the ways in which the hermeneutic imperative of detective fiction is deployed within literary (and often experimental) fiction from this period. The corpus will include nouveaux romans, works by the Oulipo writer Georges Perec, the postmodern detective fictions of Pennac and Echenoz, and Am&eacute;lie Nothombs autofiction. Students will be encouraged to explore questions of genre fiction, the productive interplay between genre fiction and literary fiction during this period, and the ways in which the tropes of detective fiction are used during the postmodern period to explore questions of knowledge, truth and identity.

   LS806 - Spanish Cinema


   
    This module aims to provide students with an analysis of some of the main trends and issues which have characterized Spanish cinema from the 1940s to the turn of the 21st century. The course will consider the place of art-cinema and popular cinema in Spain and Spanish film studies, looking at the work of a variety of directors. One of the main aims of this course is to understand films as cultural artefacts that reflect cultural, artistic, social and political debates within Spain.The module is also designed to provide students with concepts and terminology in the field of film and cultural studies and, more generally, cultural theory. Thus while the content of the module is organized chronologically to introduce students to the diverse range of film forms and film styles in the history of Spanish cinema, the course is also designed to introduce students to key theoretical approaches to the study of film. Through the analysis of individual films students will apply critical approaches to familiarise themselves with recurring debates within film culture in general and Spanish film studies in particular.Students do not require knowledge of Spanish language to study this module.

   LS810 - History and Memory: Exploring the   Independence period throug


   
    This module will use the many memoirs produced by the main participants in the independence movement. By studying in tandem personal recollections of events, some written many years later by people from all sides of the conflict we will explore the difficulties with establishing the historical truth as well as the opportunities afforded by using first hand accounts. The main aim will be to understand the intricacies of conflict through personal experiences, and to provide an exposure to the process of writing history.

   GE805 - Post-War Literature and Memory


   
    The module will follow developments in post-war literature from the period immediately after the war, where the terms of the discourse were defined largely by first-hand witnesses (Jean Am&eacute;ry, Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs etc) through to more recent work by Grass, Timm and Sebald. Questions of genre will be explored: is poetry, prose or drama better suited to a literature of remembrance? Theoretical questions pertaining to models of memory will also be raised, centering in particular on the Mitscherlichs seminal study 'Die Unf&auml;higkeit zu trauern'.

   FR804 - Real Fictions: The Documentation of Modernity


   
    The nineteenth-century novel has traditionally been seen in terms of categories or movements such as romanticism, realism, and naturalism. This module, rather than viewing novels in terms of their supposed adherence to the principles of particular aesthetic movements, reads a selection of nineteenth-century French novels as documentary fictions: fictions which document the modernity that makes them possible, and which are underpinned by incorporative documentary practices for which that modernity is also a condition of possibility. Of particular interest will be the ways in which contemporary discourses from various fields (medicine, science, historiography, social thought) are incorporated into these fictions. Rather than identifying sources, however, the emphasis will be on situating fictional texts in their wider discursive and epistemological contexts, and identifying points of commonality between literary and extraliterary discourses.

   CP808 - Writing the Self: Autobiography in the Modern Period


   
    The notion of autobiography as a documentary genre, in which the writer unproblematically records the facts of his or her life, has been called into question by modern critical studies of the genre, many of the most important theorists of autobiographical writing insisting upon its central place in the literary canon, alongside plays, novels, and poems, with which it would share a certain literariness. Focusing on a wide range of modern autobiographical texts from different national and linguistic cultures, this module will treat questions of generic definition, form, motivation, and rhetorical strategy. Among the specific questions to be considered are: Can autobiography be strictly defined? How does autobiography relate to other literary genres such as the diary or the first-person novel? Is autobiography a particular kind of narrative? Is there an identifiable rhetoric of autobiography? Is sincerity a meaningful criterion when considering autobiography? What kinds of relationship do autobiographers attempt to establish with their readers? We shall also consider some of the recurring themes in autobiographical writing since the Romantic period, including the representation of childhood, the family, sexuality, gender, ethics, mortality, and politics.

     CP805      - European Modernism: Sexual and Textual Deviance


     
      This module investigates modernism as a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary phenomenon via close readings of a selection of literary and essayistic texts written in the early decades of the 20th century by a range of key European authors. After an exploration of the socio-cultural and historical contexts from which these texts emerge, we study the specificities of modernist literature by paying close attention to the formal and stylistic innovations which accompany typically modernist thematic preoccupations, such as deviant sexuality, the workings of the unconscious, self-reflexive thematizations of the specificities of the medium, new technological developments, the city, time, decay and a sense of metaphysical despair. Stylistic techniques such as multi-perspectivity, free indirect discourse, stream-of-consciousness, montage and fragmentation are explored not just as tools for rendering a dramatically altered conception of experience, but as formal expressions of the plight of the peripatetic modernist subject in their own right.The course will be taught in English. Relevant texts may be studied in English translation, but students with proficiency in European languages are encouraged to read texts in the original language.
