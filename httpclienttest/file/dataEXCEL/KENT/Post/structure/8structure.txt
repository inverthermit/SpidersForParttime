Course structure


 The MA is composed of four taught modules and a dissertation on the topic of your own choice.

A cross-cultural, interdisciplinary programme, you study in the autumn term at the Canterbury campus which is set on 300 acres of Kentish countryside atop a hill overlooking the medieval cathedral and city;   in the spring you&rsquo;ll be in the lively, cosmopolitan and historical Paris.

The Paris centre is based at Reid Hall, a beautiful group of buildings near the Jardin du Luxembourg in the Montparnasse region in Paris&rsquo;s 14th arrondissement.   All modules are taught in English and you are encouraged to make full use of the city&rsquo;s cultural resources and to integrate these into your studies. .

There are dedicated teaching facilities with full academic guidance and support.   You&rsquo;ll also have access to some of France&rsquo;s finest libraries including: the new five-story Universit&eacute; Diderot Paris VII,   the American Library in Paris, library facilities at the Centre Pompidou and evening access to the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand.
