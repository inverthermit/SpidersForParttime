   LS806 - Spanish Cinema


   
    This module aims to provide students with an analysis of some of the main trends and issues which have characterized Spanish cinema from the 1940s to the turn of the 21st century. The course will consider the place of art-cinema and popular cinema in Spain and Spanish film studies, looking at the work of a variety of directors. One of the main aims of this course is to understand films as cultural artefacts that reflect cultural, artistic, social and political debates within Spain.The module is also designed to provide students with concepts and terminology in the field of film and cultural studies and, more generally, cultural theory. Thus while the content of the module is organized chronologically to introduce students to the diverse range of film forms and film styles in the history of Spanish cinema, the course is also designed to introduce students to key theoretical approaches to the study of film. Through the analysis of individual films students will apply critical approaches to familiarise themselves with recurring debates within film culture in general and Spanish film studies in particular.Students do not require knowledge of Spanish language to study this module.

    This module will use the many memoirs produced by the main participants in the independence movement.

   CP810 - Comparative Literature in Theory and Practice


   
    This module is designed to familiarize students with the history of Comparative Literature as an academic discipline, to develop their ability to analyse critically the major conceptions of Comparative Literature that have emerged over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and to enable them to apply theories of Comparative Literature in the analysis of literary movements, literary genres, literary topoi (such as the fallen woman), and literary figures who recur at different moments in literary history (such as Odysseus, Oedipus, Antigone, and Faust). Students will begin by studying a range of major conceptions of Comparative Literature, and will consider the implications for the discipline of Comparative Literature of theories of globalization, multiculturalism, translation studies, and world literature. They will then proceed to analyse selected literary works within the framework of these conceptions of Comparative Literature. The module will therefore combine a theoretical with a practical literary-critical dimension, encouraging close reading and an appreciation of historical context in the analysis of theoretical and literary texts.

   CP813 - Literature and Medicine


   
    This module is designed to introduce students to major works of modern fiction which address medical issues, whether these are foregrounded or incidental. The first part of the module will explore the rise of clinical, observational medicine in nineteenth-century France. The second part will examine literary representations of physical and cognitive disability in a body of twentieth- and twenty-first-century literature spanning several continents. The module will encourage students to reflect on the interface between medical and literary writing, and to contextualize these complex intersections in the scientific and medical writings of a specific period. It will also examine important medical issues such as pharmaceutical practice, mechanical orthopaedic cures, modern hospitalization, life-saving operations, and the role of medical staff in the physiological and psychological recovery of a terminally ill patient.

   CP805 - European Modernism: Sexual and Textual Deviance


   
    This module investigates modernism as a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary phenomenon via close readings of a selection of literary and essayistic texts written in the early decades of the 20th century by a range of key European authors. After an exploration of the socio-cultural and historical contexts from which these texts emerge, we study the specificities of modernist literature by paying close attention to the formal and stylistic innovations which accompany typically modernist thematic preoccupations, such as deviant sexuality, the workings of the unconscious, self-reflexive thematizations of the specificities of the medium, new technological developments, the city, time, decay and a sense of metaphysical despair. Stylistic techniques such as multi-perspectivity, free indirect discourse, stream-of-consciousness, montage and fragmentation are explored not just as tools for rendering a dramatically altered conception of experience, but as formal expressions of the plight of the peripatetic modernist subject in their own right.The course will be taught in English. Relevant texts may be studied in English translation, but students with proficiency in European languages are encouraged to read texts in the original language.

   CP808 - Writing the Self: Autobiography in the Modern Period


   
    The notion of autobiography as a documentary genre, in which the writer unproblematically records the facts of his or her life, has been called into question by modern critical studies of the genre, many of the most important theorists of autobiographical writing insisting upon its central place in the literary canon, alongside plays, novels, and poems, with which it would share a certain literariness. Focusing on a wide range of modern autobiographical texts from different national and linguistic cultures, this module will treat questions of generic definition, form, motivation, and rhetorical strategy. Among the specific questions to be considered are: Can autobiography be strictly defined? How does autobiography relate to other literary genres such as the diary or the first-person novel? Is autobiography a particular kind of narrative? Is there an identifiable rhetoric of autobiography? Is sincerity a meaningful criterion when considering autobiography? What kinds of relationship do autobiographers attempt to establish with their readers? We shall also consider some of the recurring themes in autobiographical writing since the Romantic period, including the representation of childhood, the family, sexuality, gender, ethics, mortality, and politics.
