Course structure


Across SSPSSR, there is a breadth and depth of research expertise and we can offer high-quality supervision in a wide range of areas in criminology. There are further details on the research activities and publications of individual members of staff and the School&rsquo;s research units on our website.  All research students take a research training programme with the School or Graduate School. Our MA by Research, MPhil and PhD programmes benefit from the strong research culture and expertise in the School.
