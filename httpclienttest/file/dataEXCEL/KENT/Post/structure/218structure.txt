Course structure


 The programme incorporates critical analysis and practice-based skills. This includes a
  two
-day observational 
practice learning opportunity
  and a 70-day practice learning opportunity 
in Stage 1
, with a further 100-day placement in Stage 2.

The majority of the Readiness for Direct Practice module (22 days) is taught in the autumn term of Stage 1. The remaining portion (eight  days) is taught as part of practice placement preparation and as &lsquo;recall days&rsquo; during both placements. These practice-based opportunities, along with your academic work, provide the basis for your professional development.

There is considerable emphasis on participative seminars and class sizes are generally smaller to facilitate this approach. The student body is a cosmopolitan mix of mature and younger graduates creating a rich and diverse learning environment. You are allocated an academic adviser to support and mentor you throughout the programme.

Detailed module descriptions  are provided  below.

   SO924 - The Individual, the Family and Society


   
    Taking an ecological approach to social work, the module will highlight the need for a systematic analysis of influences on individuals, families, groups and communities at micro, meso and macro levels.  This will include the role of social processes on individuals and families and theoretical approaches to human growth and development.  The module will explore bio-psycho-social influences on behaviour, individual identity and the life course, and contrasting approaches, such as critical material, discursive and intra-psychic, to understanding the individual in society.  Broader social influences on individuals and families will also be examined, such as diversity and difference throughout the life span, acknowledging cross-cultural differences in attachment, development and separation.  Applying the module content to social work practice, students will be encouraged to understand the significance of life stages and the need to adopt a life course perspective in social work with specific service user groups.  The module will highlight the significance for social workers of the intersection between psychological models and understanding the concept of need.  At the macro level of understanding, the module will explore the interaction between disadvantage in society, marginalisation, isolation and social exclusion with psychological and social factors that bring service users to the attention of social workers.

     SO897      - Social Work: Mental Health and Adult Service Users


     
      The overall aim of this module is to equip students with the advanced knowledge and understanding required for them to function effectively as social workers in mental health and adult social care settings. This might include working in a multidisciplinary mental health team, with older people, people with a physical or learning disability, or with people from all of these groups. The module considers models of understanding mental health/distress, disability and old age, in particular the contrasting perspectives of the individual/medical model and social models. The module will ensure that all students are able to recognise and understand key definitions and diagnostic categories applied in contemporary service settings, at the same time as critically questioning the nature and validity of such definitions. The module will enable students to acquire critical understanding of the impact of injustice, social inequalities and oppressive social relations on the lives of adult service users and carers, including: a) the role of these factors in contributing to the development of mental health and other problems and, b) their impact on the lives of people who already have mental health needs and/or disabilities and their families. The module will enable them to critically analyse and evaluate key concepts such as care, need and risk in adult services, and demonstrate the knowledge necessary for them to assess and make decisions in conjunction with service users, including when conflict and disagreements arise. It will highlight the evidence relating to the abuse of adult service users and the safeguarding strategies used to prevent it. The module will provide specialist input on the legal and professional frameworks that shape or prescribe social work practice in mental health services and in adult social care, including the use of online learning materials during private study time where appropriate.The module enables students to critically analyse the ideas that underpin personalisation and person-centred practice and how these relate in a practical sense to processes of self-directed support and individual budgets as ways of delivering services. Through groupwork and seminar discussions, students will demonstrate their capacity for effective and appropriate communication with others. They will have the opportunity to critically reflect on their personal attitudes towards disability, difference, and old age.The assessed work for this module will encourage students to gather and evaluate library and web-based resources appropriate for intermediate level degree study, and integrate a range of theoretical perspectives and evidence from research in order to construct a coherent argument in writing.

     SO899      - Research Methods and Dissertation


     
      The aims of this module are threefold: Firstly, to equip students to become critical consumers of research as practitioners by providing them with the knowledge and understanding necessary to evaluate research appropriately;Secondly, to provide students with the opportunity to independently carry out an in-depth inquiry to investigate a research question(s) of their choice, producing a coherent review of the relevant literature, a logical discussion and a clearly communicated set of conclusions in the form of a dissertation; Thirdly, to prepare students to become research-minded practitioners in order that they have the capacity to undertake research in practice settings and/or take a lead role in supervising others in such work. The module provides an introduction to a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods including different types of interview (narrative, biographical, in-depth, semi-structured, structured) ethnography, focus groups, surveys and questionnaires, experimental and quasi-experimental research, randomised controlled trials, documentary and textual analysis, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and approaches that involve mixing methods. The module outlines the different epistemological and ideological foundations of contrasting research paradigms.The module includes exposure to the techniques involved in analysing both qualitative and quantitative data, as well as considering ethical issues relating to research. The module will demonstrate the existence and value of repositories of both quantitative and qualitative data and how these may be accessed and utilised.Each week students are provided with research articles that are compulsory reading for discussion in seminars/workshops. Each reading provides an example of methods as used in research, their potential in addressing specific kinds of research question, and their relevance for social work practice. Students are required to draft a dissertation proposal for reviewing or evaluating an aspect of social work theory or practice. Through this they are required to apply their learning on the module through the interpretation of study findings and the development of coherent recommendations for social care and social work
