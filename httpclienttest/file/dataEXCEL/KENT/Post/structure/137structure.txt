Course structure


 The programme examines the major theories of conflict and conflict resolution in international affairs, supplementing theory with detailed case studies. Topics include negotiation, mediation, conference diplomacy, third party intervention, restorative justice, peacekeeping, peacemaking, and coercive diplomacy.

Full-time students complete the MA in International Conflict Analysis over twelve months. Study is divided between taught modules, which last for one term each, and dissertation work. For full-time students, a total of six modules must be taken over the first two terms. Supervised dissertation work, on a relevant agreed subject, is then undertaken during the remainder of the academic year.

The MA can be taken on a part-time basis, typically over two years but flexible arrangements are also possible. When taking it over two years, part-time students choose three modules in each academic year, and write a supervised dissertation thereafter.

The programme is also offered in a 120 ECTS format &ndash; comprising nine taught modules plus a dissertation over 18 months &ndash; and as a Postgraduate Diploma &ndash; comprising six taught modules only &ndash; worth 120 Kent credits (60 ECTS). Both the 120 ECTS version and the Diploma can also be taken on a part-time basis.

A two-year MA with the first year spent in Brussels and the second year in Canterbury is also available and is worth 120 ECTS.

This list is based on the current curriculum and may change year to year in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.   Most programmes will require you to study a combination of compulsory and optional modules. You may also have the option to take modules from other programmes so that you may customise your programme and explore other subject areas that interest you.


 

      
   PO825 - Philosophy & Methodology of Politics and International Relations


   
    Students of politics have not been, in general, sufficiently reflective about the nature and scope of their discipline. They just do it rather than talk about it' (G.Stoker). Given that political scientists study people  individuals, groups, states, nations, cultures  rather than things, PO825 moves from the assumption that politics students ought to be reflective about their research. The module aims to provide an opportunity for reflection by presenting some of the key theoretical and methodological debates in politics and international relations. These debates deal with issues such as: the concept of the political and the concept of power; the relationship between structure and agency; the causal and constitutive role of ideas and discourse; positivism and post-positivism; critical theory, emancipation, and the importance of normative questions; an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research, to research design and research ethics.

   PO832 - Conflict Resolution in World Politics


   
    The module aims to introduce current thinking and practice in the field on conflict resolution, conflict management and conflict transformation, including conflict prevention and peace-building.  Can protracted violent conflicts be prevented, and how are they brought to an end?  Is it possible to deal with the root causes of conflict?  How do the wider conflicts in the international system impact on local and regional conflicts, and under what circumstances are conflicts transformed?  We will explore these questions with reference to theories of conflict resolution, comparative studies and case studies.  The module will focus mainly on international and intra-state conflict.  There will be opportunities to discuss conflicts at other levels, such as the role of diasporas and the media in conflict and its transformation.  You are encouraged to draw on your own personal knowledge of conflict situations.

   PO828 - Theories of Conflict and Violence


   
    This module will examine how conflict research has evolved within the field of political science and International Relations. It will initially investigate competing theories on conflict and violence highlighting specific case studies and new security concerns. The theoretical reflections will focus on the understanding of modern nationalism in world politics as well as different aspects of conflict ranging from inter-state to intra-state conflict. Moreover, students will be exposed to a detailed and critical analysis of the political and constitutional options in societies beset by violent ethnic conflict, with particular emphasis being given to mechanisms directed at the achievement of political accommodation.

   PO942 - Resistance and the Politics of Truth


   
    The truth will set you free is a maxim that is central to both theories and practices of resistance. It is a claim that has, nonetheless, come under fire from a wide array of critical perspectives not the least of which are those of the poststructuralist and post-foundational political philosophies that have emerged during the second half of the twentieth century and that continue to inspire admiration and condemnation in almost equal measure. In this module, poststructuralist will refer to a body of work produced primarily in France since the 1960s that challenged our understanding of truth by developing the critique of humanism in ways that emphasised the contingent nature of meaning generating structures. The main representatives of this perspective in this module will be Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. By post-foundational is meant a body of work that critically questions poststructuralist approaches to contingency while reinvigorating the concept of truth as a political force. The primary representative of this approach is Alain Badiou. Both perspectives have developed event-oriented philosophies  that view the category of the event as ontologically primary  but they have conceived of this in competing ways. A main theme of the module will be how to understand the relationship between truth and politics as an event.  In other words, what happens in practices of resistance?

   PO950 - The Governance of the European Union


   
    The aim of the module is offer an advanced understanding of the functioning of the European Union as a system of supra-national governance. It is divided into two main parts. The first part focusses on the key institutions involved in the governance process and analyses the nature and functioning of each of them as well as the interaction among them from a theoretical, empirical and normative perspective. The second part focusses on the systems outputs in terms of public policy, with particular attention paid to the fields of market regulation, monetary union, justice and home affairs, and enlargement. The module ends with a debate on the effectiveness and the legitimacy of the European Union as a system of supra-national governance and on how it should be reformed to maximise those aspects.

   PO937 - Resistance in Theory


   
    This module will address the relationship between theories and practices of resistance from the perspective of theory. As such, it will focus on specific ideas and models that conceptualise and theorise resistance to political authority with a view to examining the following: the philosophical and political bases of resistance; the presuppositions that underpin theories of resistance; the appeal to alternative ideas and arrangements; the tensions and possible contradictions that characterise such theories. There are two dimensions to this module. First of all, the theme of resistance will be explored in the history of political ideas, from Plato via patristic, medieval and modern thinkers to contemporary writings such as those of Alain Badiou. Secondly, the theme of resistance will be related to different conceptions of the political and rival accounts of alternative arrangements to the prevailing order. As such, this module provides a strong grounding in theories of resistance that prepares students for the second core module on practices of resistance.

   PO953 - Understanding Political Institutions


   
    The aim of the module is to enable students to develop an advanced understanding of central questions in comparative politics.  Students will examine questions that have been of enduring interest to comparative political scientists including the origins and influence of the state, the causes and consequences of authoritarian and democratic forms of government and variations within these regime types for governmental performance including the operation and function of key political institutions.  As students engage with these questions they will also be introduced to theoretical, conceptual and methodological questions and debates within comparative politics and will explore the interaction between economic, social, historical, political and institutional factors in explaining similarities and differences in the political development of nations.

   PO824 - International Relations Theory


   
    Whenever we make a statement about international affairs, we rely on certain (often implicit) theoretical assumptions: about power, interests, identities, norms and how they relate to the behaviour of international actors. Whether we like it or not, we are doomed to rely on theories. The starting-point of this course is not that theories are the only possible and all-encompassing approach to the study of international affairs, but that they are helpful to understand, compare and critically evaluate interpretations of international issues: if we all use theoretical assumptions, we better make them explicit and understood, to make sure what exactly we are claiming.International Relations theories are not approached as strict categories with clear boundaries, but rather as a continuously evolving debate. The course does not attempt to give an encyclopedic overview of all theories of International Relations, but rather to confront different views. The main objective is to understand the core differences between different theoretical approaches. The course starts by discussing the nature of theorizing in international relations, pointing out how theories do not simply explain or predict, they tell us what possibilities exist for human action and intervention, they define not merely our explanatory possibilities, but also our ethical and practical horizons  (Smith, 1996: 113).  Some of the core dividing lines underlying theoretical debates (explaining/understanding, positivism/post-positivism, rationalism/constructivism, etc.) are also introduced.. After that, different theories are studied in depth.The course proceeds through successive phases of IR theory. The first phase, that of liberal internationalism (also referred to as inter-war idealism emerged in the aftermath of WW1. We will engage with the leading authors of that tradition and find in their works the foundations of our modern world: international law, economic interdependence and international organization. In the third week we turn to the second phase of IR Theory, classical Realism, who responded to the failure of inter-war idealism by reasserting the nature of the political in IR as being predicated on clashing interests. The English School, who focus on the idea of International Society, are the focus of the fourth week. In week 5 and 6 we move to the first epistemological break in IR, with both Neorealism and Neoliberalism breaking decisively away from the classical approach championed by Hedley Bull. Running in parallel with mainstream IR, Marxist theorists were also developing Methods designed to adapt and apply Marxism to global politics, their work is examined in week 7. In week 8 we encounter another epistemological break: this time between positivism and post-positivism, a debate about the nature and limits of theory that continues to shape the discipline.  In week 9, Critical Theorys focus on human emancipation is brought to the fore. In week 10, the leading challenger to Neorealism and Neoliberalism, social constructivism, will be examined. In week 11, the classes will revolve around two major ethical positions in IR, cosmopolitanism and Realism. The course will conclude in week 12 with a revision session.

   PO917 - Terrorism and Crimes of the State


   
    The purpose of the module is to develop an understanding of the complex relationships between terrorism, counter-terrorism efforts, and human rights, both at home and abroad. Central to the module is the role of the state in responding to terrorism, in attempting to prevent terrorism, and in itself using and sponsoring terrorism. In this regard students are encouraged to re-evaluate assumptions about the state and its place in domestic and international politics, focusing particularly on crimes by the state. Students will be introduced to competing approaches to the study of terrorism, many of which are grounded in wider theories and approaches common to International Relations and Security Studies. One of the challenges of the module is to think critically about the implications and consequences of those various approaches. The module will begin by looking at the various methodological, theoretical, and definitional challenges associated with the study of terrorism. Building on this grounding, students will then begin analysing terrorism, counter-terrorism and the role of the state through a number of case studies drawn from the 20th and early 21st Centuries. They will be encouraged to relate each of the case studies to the broader methodological and theoretical debates explored in the first few weeks of the module.

   PO831 - The European Union in the World


   
    This module focuses on the position of Europe and the EU in particular - what it does and how it does it - in the world, through the perceptions of the other. The first challenge of this broad approach is to tackle the question what is Europe?, by way of situating Europe between the regional and global change, and understanding its multifaceted, multi-actor and multi-level environment and associated with it challenges, in the increasingly inter-dependent and inter-polar world. As part of the exercise we will focus more specifically on EU actorness reiterated through the changing modes of governance  from disciplinary and hierarchical, to more adaptable and from a distance  and democracy promotion policies, to understand how it behaves vis-&agrave;-vis the outside world. Premised on this, we will examine EU actorness in practical terms by referring to EU interactions with the other  from the neighbourhood, BRICS, to US, and Russia. The objective is to cross-compare what the EU is and what it does to enable wider generalisations of what kind of transformative power the EU is? today, in this increasingly globalising world.

     PO951      - States, Nations and Democracy


     
      The module draws from comparative politics, international relations, and political thought to analyse the past, present, and future of the democratic national state, the dominant form of political system in todays world. It addresses questions such as: Why are some states federal and others unitary? What explains the resilience of nationalism? Does economic integration leads to political disintegration? Why has regional integration gone much further in Europe than elsewhere? Is multi-national democracy possible? The module first charts the emergence of the modern state and its transformation into a national and democratic form of political system. Subsequently, it explores some key aspects of the formation, structuring, restructuring, and termination of states such as the unitary/federal dichotomy, processes of devolution, the challenge of secession, the question of the connections between the economic environment and the number and size of states, the phenomenon of supra-state regional integration, and the connections between nationality and democracy. It concludes by assessing the challenges facing the democratic national state in the 21st century and their likely trajectory in the foreseeable future.

     PO848      - Negotiation and Mediation


     
      This module explores the way in which violent conflict can be resolved peacefully. Focusing predominately on negotiation (bi-lateral discussions) and mediation (third party led dialogue) we discuss both the practical and theoretical aspects of peace processes. The aim is to provide an overview of the main problems negotiators face when attempting to resolve incompatibilities between individuals or groups. In addition to the theoretical discussion focused on case studies and systematic empirical research, we also develop practical skills of course participants by using a range of simulation exercises. The course has two main sections. The first section is focused on negotiation and is designed to teach practical negotiating skills using the Harvard Negotiation method. This is based on the premise that individuals can and do impact the outcome of international negotiations, which should not just be thought of in the abstract as between governments or parties or businesses. As well as discussing useful tools, students will have an opportunity in class to make use of these tools in role plays, and short written assignments. The emphasis is very much on learning through practical experience.The second section of the course will concentrate on third party intervention in international conflicts, and in particular on mediation and problem solving techniques. This will also aim to give you experience of working in small groups on a practical issue in the area of third party problem solving by examining cases in depth.

     PO8100      - Quantitative Methodology for Political Science


     
      This course is designed for graduate students in Political Science and will serve as an introduction to quantitative methods for social science research. Given that the majority of the highest level research in Political Science is conducted in the language of quantitative methodology, students will learn the use of quantitative research methods as a tool to further their research and participation in debates of the social sciences. Students can further expect to be introduced to not only the means for conducting rigorous, empirical, and quantitative research in social science fields but also how this methodology adheres to the scientific accumulation of knowledge about these phenomena. The course is intended to develop core competencies in quantitative research. These competencies include methodological literacy (the ability to read, understand, and critically assess quantitative research); statistical abilities (the ability to determine, apply, and use the appropriate statistical techniques to inform and/or support an argument as well as understand the limitations of statistical techniques); and research skills (the ability to use and present quantitative methodology to address a research question).

     PO8101      - Comparative Political Behaviour


     
      The module introduces students to some of the core issues in the field of comparative political behaviour, one of the largest groupings within the field of comparative politics. The module begins by considering some of the basic theoretical issues involved in studying political behaviour.  It then moves on to consider explanations for the two most significant issues within the field of comparative political behaviour, namely voting patterns and political participation. Within these blocks, the module includes discussion on various policy-relevant issues. The module then moves on to consider wider issues around political behaviour, notably the nature of public opinion and political representation.

     PO817      - Resistance and Alternatives to Capitalism andDemocracy


     
      This module is situated at the interface of political theory and political economy. It seeks to explore the complex and multi-faceted links between democracy and capitalism in the period from 1848 to the present day. The particular focus is on relations between the state and the market as well as the evolution of different democratic regimes and market economies. Similar emphasis will be on conceptual issues and empirical evidence (though no statistical or econometric skills will be required).The first part of the module examines the formation of market-states, beginning with a critical discussion of this concept in recent scholarship. This will be the starting point for a wider engagement with Smithian, Marxist, Keynesian and neo-liberal accounts. The focus will be on those who theorise the conditions for the convergence of state and market, including Smith, Marx, Keynes and Friedman but also some contemporary theorists. Emphasis will be on strategies of resistance and alternatives to capitalism (e.g. Karl Polanyi, Catholic Social Teaching, civil economy).The second part turns to the evolution of democracy in relation to capitalism. A brief survey of the recent post-democracy literature will be followed by a discussion of key concepts. Examples include the work of the Frankfurt School on capitalism and democracy as quasi-religions and various arguments that formal democratic representation and abstract capitalist exchange engender a society of spectacle. Just as the first part focuses on the state and the market, so the second part puts emphasis on the interaction between the politics of democracy and the economics of capitalism.

     PO916      - Security in a Changing World


     
      This module focuses on the evolution of security studies as a discipline and its implications for practice. We examine a variety of theoretical and empirical materials that provide students with the basis for analysing pressing questions related to issues of war, security and peace in the world today. This module thus provides a good grounding for understanding contemporary security challenges (such as the environmental degradation, conflict, gender-based insecurity, terrorism, mass surveillance and arms proliferation among others) and our responses to them. It will engage with debates around the broadening and deepening agenda of security studies, which has extended the scope of security studies beyond the nation-state, and the role of new security actors.

     PO936      - Resistance in Practice


     
      This module will look at how ideas of resistance are translated into political action. What are the modalities, costs and consequences of this process? We will look at specific instances of resistance to political authority and examine the techniques of resistance employed, the assumptions that underpin these techniques, and the tensions and problems that arise as ideas are actualised in political reality. Studying historical examples of resistance will help us reflect on the complex relationship between theory and practice in political reality.As part of the Resistance in Practice module, students can choose between submitting an academic essay on a historical instance of resistance and performing a practice of resistance. We envision that such practices of resistance could involve poetry, theatre, painting, sculpture, video, film, photography, music and other forms of artistic expression. The practice has to be a documented practice, which means that students have to submit not just the performance but also a portfolio in which they reflect on what they did and why. Early on in the module, students interested in submitting a documented practice for assessment discuss their ideas with the module convenor, and they will continue to work on their projects with the help of a supervisor.
