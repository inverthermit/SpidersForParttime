   SP998 - Advanced Research Project in Psychology


   
    All students undertake a supervised empirical research project in an area of psychology relevant to their chosen MSc programme, and submit it as a typed dissertation of 8,000-10,000 words. The aim of the dissertation is to test the student's ability to plan, execute, analyse, and report a piece of independent research in the relevant setting. The dissertation requires detailed theoretical knowledge of the discipline, an appreciation of the ways in which that knowledge has been applied in previous research and practice, and the methodological and statistical skills to set up a scientific investigation. Supervision is provided by the principal teaching staff and by other appropriate staff with research interests in a student's chosen area. Students are advised to read the School's Ethics pages for information on submitting applications for ethical approval to the School and to relevant outside bodies.Timetable: Students are encouraged to approach potential supervisors early to discuss possible topics for research. A research proposal is written and agreed with the supervisor in the Autumn Term. An ethical application is also submitted to the School's Research Ethics Panel and outside ethics committees if appropriate. The research is conducted in the Spring and Summer Terms. The deadline for submission of dissertations is in August.

   SP801 - Statistics and Methodology


   
    The aim of this module is to provide a postgraduate-level orientation to both basic and advanced contemporary statistical and methodological issues in psychology. It is compulsory for all our MSc students. The methodological issues considered include validity and reliability in measurement; experimental, quasi-experimental, and correlational research designs in the laboratory and field; observational, archival, and qualitative research methodologies; and the problem of bias in psychological research. The statistical techniques taught include univariate and bivariate descriptive and inferential statistics; psychometric techniques; exploratory data analysis; basic and advanced topics in ANOVA and ANCOVA; multiple regression; factor analysis; and structural equation modelling.

   SP851 - Advanced Topics in Cognitive Development


   
    This module explores the typical development of key cognitive functions and the psychological methods employed to study these developments.  The aim of the module is to explore these topics at an advanced level, allowing students to evaluate critically pieces of research in terms of their findings, conceptual underpinnings, and/or methodological approaches.  Topics covered in the module usually include, among others: the development of executive functioning; the development of theory of mind; language and reading development; sensory development; methods for measuring cognition in preverbal populations; methods for measuring cognition in childhood; critical periods of development and neurological plasticity.

   SP854 - Advanced Topics in Developmental Psychopathology


   
    The study of developmental psychopathology aims to understand and elucidate the behavioural manifestations of developmental disorders, as well as the cognitive, neurobiological, and etiological bases of those behavioural manifestations.  In so doing, the study also has implications for our understanding of typical development, because it provides the opportunity to address questions about the extent to which behaviour and its underpinnings are, for example, innate versus learned and domain-specific versus domain-general. This module aims to provide you with a strong understanding of theories of prevalent developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment) and the methods used to investigate them.  You will be encouraged to critically evaluate these theories and methods, and to develop a wider awareness of how the study of developmental psychopathology is relevant to our understanding of typical development.  You will also learn directly from practitioners about the challenges faced working with people with developmental disorders and the techniques employed to support them.

   SP850 - Advanced Cognitive (Neuroscience) Methods in Practice


   
    This module will provide students with theoretical instruction and practical experience in some key advanced research methods appropriate for scientific research in cognitive (neuro)psychology. The study of cognitive processes and the temporal nature of brain activity will feature highly in this module. The lectures will introduce key cognitive research methods (i.e. behavioural reaction times, eye-movements analysis and event-related brain potentials) and discuss relevant theory, experimental design and analysis. Lab-based practical sessions will be interspersed throughout the course to allow students to gain hands-on experience with using these research methods. This practical experience will enable them to generate concise plans for their own research activity and to develop critical thinking when evaluating others research.This module provides theoretical instruction and practical experience in some key advanced research methods appropriate for scientific research in cognitive (neuro)psychology.

   SP802 - Current Issues in Social and Applied Psychology Part 1


   
    Current Issues in Social and Applied Psychology I deals with the conceptual frameworks offered by social psychology and the ways in which social psychology has been or can be applied. The module explores important conceptual issues, including the levels of analysis we adopt, the nature of social knowledge, the self in social psychology, social influence, social cognition and attitude change, discourse analysis, the social psychology of language, and the theory of applied social psychology.

   SP813 - Advanced Topics in Intergroup Relations


   
    This module examines advanced theory and research in intergroup relations. We consider the nature of social categorisation processes and how stereotypes develop, persist and change. The module then examines the relationship between intergroup perceptions and prejudice, and how intergroup relationships influence both variables. The module examines how and why stereotypes and prejudice become manifested as discrimination and intergroup conflict, and then how groups become mobilised to perform collective action. We study the motivational and social elements in intergroup relationships, social identity as a group member, and how these issues can be studied both in the laboratory and in real world settings.This module examines advanced theory and research in intergroup relations.

   SP842 - Advanced Developmental Social Psychology


   
    Advanced Developmental Social Psychology aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the theoretical accounts of major issues within the field of developmental social psychology (e.g. prejudice and stereotype development).
