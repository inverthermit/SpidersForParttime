Course structure


You undertake supervised research within the School of European Culture and Languages, specialising in one of the topic(s) listed  under research areas.

Each research student is assigned two internal supervisors who arrange the programme of study and research to suit individual interests. Staff have received research finance from sources including the British Academy, Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Leverhulme Trust, English Heritage, European Union funds and University sources. In the last couple of years, we have been awarded INSTAP funding totalling $30,000 and grants from the Mediterranean Archaeology Trust, UCLA and the Cotsen Foundation for Academic Research (&euro;300,000).
