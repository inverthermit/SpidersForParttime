   CB9062 - Leadership and Change


   
    Leadership can be defined as the capacity to influence people, by means of personal attributes and/or behaviours to achieve a common goal. Leadership is not just about the qualities of an elite few, although the leadership skills of chief executives and their teams are of fundamental importance for organisations. Leadership and management is a highly contextual and contingent activity. Change management is effectively the implementation of corporate strategy, yet there is research evidence that there is a lack of change management capacity and capability within organisations in general.  This module aims to familiarise students with major contemporary research evidence on effective approaches to leadership and development practice. Particular approaches to leadership (transactional/transformational leadership, authentic leadership, power and influence), an understanding of management approaches, teaching and research focusing on the links between people management practices and positive organisational outcomes will be covered, alongside research highlighting major contemporary changes and developments in practice. There will also be discussions and debates in the specific fields of leadership, change management and leadership development. Contemporary topics such as ethical leadership, diversity and leadership (covering topics such as women leaders, multicultural leadership) and case studies on leadership in public and private sectors will be covered. Students will also be informed in HR matters such as managing others fairly and effectively, increasing levels of engagement, commitment, motivation and performance.

   CB990 - A Systems Approach to Managing Complexity


   
    The world in which we live is becoming increasingly complex. This is manifest in both in the speed of change that we face, and in the increasing inter-connectedness of areas that we manage. A further facet of this complexity is the plurality of viewpoints and values with which we have to deal.One particular discipline - the systems approach - has developed explicitly in response to the complexity of the world. It leads us to view the world systemically or holistically rather than linearly. It is not purely academic, but a very practically oriented discipline which has developed a number of different methodologies that aim to help managers improve the problematic situations with which they have to deal.This module covers basic systems concepts, a range of practical methodologies, and some of the process skills necessary for their use.
