Course structure


Research students participate in a series of regular events. These include work-inprogress seminars and professional development workshops, both of which are organised at School level. You are also able to enrol on the Graduate School&rsquo;s Researcher Development Programme.

Our research students also actively participate in a research seminar, which brings leading scholars and practitioners to Kent. We also hold an annual postgraduate presentation day.
