Course structure


 The programme involves:

 the sociological study of crime and its application to criminal justice and social policy
 the study of issues at the cutting edge of current criminological debate with a strong emphasis on the cultural context of crime
 advanced criminological theory and research methods as applied to crime and criminal justice.


It also offers opportunities for you to develop your career in the areas of criminal justice, policy and government. We are constantly developing the modules available to you in line with current issues and staff expertise. Each year we announce new choices, for example we are currently working on developing a module convened by Dr David Redmon which looks at documentary film-making from a social science perspective.

You have the opportunity to spend a semester (spring or summer) at one of our European partner universities. Our partner universities include Erasmus University, Rotterdam, University of Hamburg, University of Ghent, ELTE University in Budapest and Utrecht University.

   SO869 - Theories of Crime


   
    In the late modern period we are presented with an extraordinary wealth of criminological theory.  Past and present paradigms proliferate and prosper. This course examines these theories, placing them in the context of the massive social transformations that have taken place in the last thirty years. It is not concerned so much with abstract theory as criminological ideas, which arise in particular contexts. It aims, therefore, to situate theories in contemporary debates and controversies and allows students to fully utilize theoretical insights in their criminological work. In particular we will introduce the current debates surrounding cultural criminology, the debate over quantitative methods and the emergence of a critical criminology.

   SO870 - Research Methods in Criminology


   
    This module provides grounding in the theories, logics and methods that underpin criminological research. As such, students will learn about the principles involved in designing, carrying out and interpreting research. The module focuses on the relationship between empirical data (what is observed/measured in the real world) and the development of theory (academic thought). Students are encouraged to learn how to ask appropriate criminological questions and to design studies which draw on the most appropriate methods to answer them. These methods include both primary empirical work (quantitative and qualitative) and secondary work (e.g. dataset analysis, literature analysis). The module thus is also concerned with how data can be interpreted and analysed. Beyond equipping students with intellectual and practical skills in the field of criminological research, the module fosters a capacity to critically evaluate research in general.

   SO881 - Cultural Criminology


   
    This module is concerned with developing a sophisticated understanding of the contested meanings underpinning crime and its control and the manner in which such meanings are intertwined with various different cultural phenomena. The module explores the complex patterns and sites of contest, control and resistance that bisect everyday life. This is achieved through engaging in a detailed consideration of cutting edge theory and research in the fields of cultural and visual criminology. The module will place criminality, policing, crime prevention, music, photography, emotionality, extreme sports, advertising, protest, war, physicality and the film in new and exciting contexts. The module equips students with the necessary theoretical tools and modes of social inquiry to make sense of a late-modern world permeated by crime and its control.

The focus is on the UK situation, analysis is also extended towards an international perspective. The module focuses on five key themes that are underpinned by analysis of the sociological, cultural and spatial dimension of youth crime. We begin by examining current trends in youth offending and explore media responses and then go on to look at the youth problem from an historical context. We will then go on to focus on the following key substantive themes; gangs, violence and territoriality; drugs, alcohol and night time economies; young people, urban space and antisocial behaviour; and the criminal justice response to youth crime.  Throughout the module, attention is given to the importance of understanding the connections of youth crime with race, class and gender and at the same time, engages with key theoretical ideas and debates that inform our understandings of youth crime.  Within the organisation of the module the content will include practical newspaper workshops where students will be encouraged to co-operate on issues based around the above themes and to participate verbally within the context of class discussions, group presentations and class debate.

During the spring term, the students will finalise their proposal with their chosen supervisor. If the dissertation requires ethical research approval, an application will be submitted to the school research ethics committee by the beginning of the summer term. During the summer term and vacation, students will meet their supervisor every fortnight to discuss the progress of their dissertation. The supervisors will provide feedback on written work and will set monthly work plans and targets for the students.
