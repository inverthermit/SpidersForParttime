<p>The degree combines modules in actuarial modelling, financial reporting, insurance, pensions, economics, finance, mathematics and statistics to develop techniques and skills to assess, evaluate and manage future financial risk and thereby address a wide range of practical problems in long-term financial planning and management.</p>
<p>A lot of actuaries' work might be thought of as risk management, which assesses how likely an event may be and the costs associated with that event. This might include investigating how life insurance reserves and future premiums might balance future claims, analysing investment risks, or projecting the financial costs of an epidemic.</p></td>

It is a discipline which also has important applications in industry and commerce, and well-qualified mathematicians and statisticians are in great demand, with a wide choice of careers, making Mathematics an excellent choice as a degree subject. Mathematical Studies at Queen's encompasses three subject areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied Mathematics</li>
<li>Pure Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics and Operational Research (SOR)</li>
</ul>
<p>In each, the ideas that have been encountered at school are extended and new areas are introduced. It is important to appreciate that what may be understood as either Pure or Applied Mathematics from school experience will differ from the University experience. For this reason, amongst others, Mathematics students usually study both Pure and Applied Mathematics in the first year, with Statistics being a likely third component.</p>
<p>Queen's offers several different degree programmes involving Mathematics, and there are two types of degree available within these programmes - the three-year BSc and the four-year MSci.</p>
<h4>BSc Degrees</h4>
<p>The BSc degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This is a joint degree which combines these two subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>

<p><strong>1. The concurrent route</strong></p>
<p>The four-year Bachelor of Education (BEd) Honours degree offered by the University Colleges (St Mary's or Stranmillis) is a professional degree programme&nbsp;for those intending to teach in Nursery, Primary or Post-Primary schools. Professional preparation is concurrent with the study of academic subjects.</p>
<p><strong>2. The consecutive route</strong></p>
<p>You will come to the University and take a degree other than Education, applying on graduation to the one-year postgraduate teacher training course (PGCE) in the University's School of Education. St Mary's and Stranmillis offer specialist PGCE programmes in Irish-Medium education and Early Years Education respectively. Either way, you will be a graduate of Queen's and a qualified teacher. The University and the University Colleges are required by the Government to adhere to strict quotas for admission to each type of course as a means of matching the output of teachers to the number of vacant posts. However with the concurrent route you will still be qualified to teach in any type of school.</p>
<p>If you want to be a Primary or a Post-Primary teacher and decide on the concurrent route, you can apply through UCAS to follow the BEd degree in Stranmillis University College. Applications for the BEd degree in St Mary’s University College must be made directly to the College, thereby providing additional application options outside UCAS. Information on how to apply is available on the Colleges’ websites.</p></td>

As well as gaining an understanding of the renewable energy sector, students will also be able to develop a sound understanding of current environmental and waste management systems, their future development and the legislation surrounding changes in environmental practice and resource management.</p>
<p>Foundation Degrees (FD) are distinctive in that they integrate employer involvement, accessibility, articulation and progression, flexibility and partnership into a single award.</p>
<p>The Foundation Degree in Energy, Environment and Sustainability meets all these attributes through the provision of work placement, real-life case studies, an articulation route to the BSc Honours Land Use and Environmental Management degree within Queen's and partnership with South West College, Omagh Campus, where the programme is delivered.</p>
<p>This Foundation Degree develops and improves participants' environmental knowledge and sustainable practices aimed at increasing diversification of economies. Through consideration of up-to-date environmental issues, a focus on economic and social renewal and knowledge transfer from best practice and demonstration models, graduates will be provided with a qualification to benefit business communities, their support workers and the public.</p></td>

<p>Students are encouraged to select from a wide range of modules, in geographical as well as chronological terms. Modules are available relating not only to Ireland and Great Britain, but also to Continental Europe, Africa, Asia and North America, and to European expansion overseas. Within these areas, there are modules dealing with political developments, religious and economic change, and with social and cultural history, including modules in gender and women's history.</p></td>

	<td class="hidden"><p>Human Biology is the integrated study of human anatomy and physiology, including the study of the body in health and disease. It covers a wide range of topics, ranging from investigating microorganisms and the role they play in disease, to immunology and the role the human immune system plays in protecting us from these microorganisms. Students also learn about ever-changing subjects such as genetics, evolutionary biology and pharmacology.</p>
<p>The Human Biology degree at Queen's is underpinned by the core disciplines of Anatomy, Microanatomy and Physiology (the study of the function of the human body). In addition, it provides a solid foundation in Mammalian Biochemistry, Genetics, Molecular Biology, and Microbiology.</p>
<p>The degree is designed to allow a greater degree of flexibility in the choice of modules, in comparison to the degree in Biomedical Sciences.</p>
<p>Specialist subject areas which can be studied in detail include Pharmacology, Topographical Anatomy, Exercise and Applied Physiology, Developmental Studies and Science Teaching. Within these subject areas we provide a range of learning experiences.<br><br></p></td>

It is a discipline which also has important applications in industry and commerce, and well-qualified mathematicians and statisticians are in great demand, with a wide choice of careers, making Mathematics an excellent choice as a degree subject. Mathematical Studies at Queen's encompasses three subject areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied Mathematics</li>
<li>Pure Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics and Operational Research (SOR)</li>
</ul>
<p>In each, the ideas that have been encountered at school are extended and new areas are introduced. It is important to appreciate that what may be understood as either Pure or Applied Mathematics from school experience will differ from the University experience. For this reason, amongst others, Mathematics students usually study both Pure and Applied Mathematics in the first year, with Statistics being a likely third component.</p>
<p>Queen's offers several different degree programmes involving Mathematics, and there are two types of degree available within these programmes - the three-year BSc and the four-year MSci.</p>
<h4>BSc Degrees</h4>
<p>The BSc degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This is a joint degree which combines these two subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>

	<td class="hidden"><p>Planning is about changing the places within which we live. How we can transform and improve our cities, towns, villages, neighbourhoods and communities. It affects our everyday lives and is an extremely exciting discipline to study at university. A planning degree provides you with the knowledge and skills to be able to make decisions that shape the processes of growth and development. We currently face many major challenges - attracting investment, creating jobs, protecting the environment, energy policy, housing supply, transport links, providing local amenities - and planning affects how these things happen. Therefore, as future planners you will have a very important role to play in shaping the future. Planning is a broad subject matter and planners perform many different roles relating to the natural, physical, economic, social and cultural environments that we live in. Given this, planning offers a wide spectrum of employment opportunities. Studying planning will equip you with the knowledge to understand how cities, towns, villages, communities and neighbourhoods function and operate, and then have the skills to make decisions that shape how they grow and prosper.<br><br><br></p></td>

The PPE at Queen's takes a more integrated approach to the study of PPE than many comparable programmes. It is based on the view that, to understand social phenomena, one must approach them from several disciplinary directions. This degree illuminates how these three areas complement one another.</p>

<li>Politics acquaints students with the institutions and processes that produce decisions governing our lives<br><br></li>

<p>As an applied social science, Social Policy provides a useful and relevant bridge between politics, sociology and economics and it draws on insights from these disciplines to analyse current policy and consider how we can achieve improvements.</p>
<p>Social Policy asks questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much responsibility falls to the individual or to society and the state when an individual is homeless, unemployed, poor or ill?<br><br></li>
<li>Should the welfare state offer care and protection to everyone 'from the cradle to the grave' or should society help those who help themselves?<br><br></li>
<li>Do people have a right to a basic income, a home, a job and education, or are obligations and duties more important than rights?</li>
</ul>
<p>Against a backdrop of social and economic upheaval it is more important than ever to understand the effects of government policies on individuals, families and communities, and the practical, political and ideological reasons underlying the formation of specific social policies.</p>
<p>Our degrees concentrate overall on policy in the UK and Ireland, but also take a comparative perspective that explores, where appropriate, how other nations provide public services.<br><br></p></td>

<p>One way of understanding social trends is to count people, activities and events, and societies are now awash with data on every aspect of people's lives. Sociologists need to become specialists in making sense of this data.</p>
<p>Queen's is one of only fifteen universities across the UK that have been funded* as part of Q-Step initiative to promote a step-change in undergraduate quantitative social science training. The initiative trains students to analyse social data through the delivery of specialist undergraduate programmes, including new courses, work placements and pathways to postgraduate study.</p>
<p>The BSc in Sociology with Quantitative Methods degree combines the curiosity of social inquiry with the quantitative skills required to collect and analyse social data. The degree is a key component of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/StudyatQueens/CourseFinder/UG/%22http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/QStep%22" target="&quot;_blank&quot;">Queen's Q-Step Centre</a> as it helps to address the critical shortage of quantitatively-skilled social science graduates. The need for such graduates is evidenced in the British Academy's position paper '<em>Society Counts</em>' which argues that "<em>Well-rounded graduates, equipped with core quantitative skills, are vital if the UK is to retain its status as a world leader in research and higher education, rebuild its economy, and provide citizens with the means to understand, analyse and criticise data</em>”.</p>

<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>

<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>

<p>A lot of actuaries' work might be thought of as risk management, which assesses how likely an event may be and the costs associated with that event. This might include investigating how life insurance reserves and future premiums might balance future claims, analysing investment risks, or projecting the financial costs of an epidemic.</p></td>

It is a discipline which also has important applications in industry and commerce, and well-qualified mathematicians and statisticians are in great demand, with a wide choice of careers, making Mathematics an excellent choice as a degree subject. Mathematical Studies at Queen's encompasses three subject areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied Mathematics</li>
<li>Pure Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics and Operational Research (SOR)</li>
</ul>
<p>In each, the ideas that have been encountered at school are extended and new areas are introduced. It is important to appreciate that what may be understood as either Pure or Applied Mathematics from school experience will differ from the University experience. For this reason, amongst others, Mathematics students usually study both Pure and Applied Mathematics in the first year, with Statistics being a likely third component.</p>
<p>Queen's offers several different degree programmes involving Mathematics, and there are two types of degree available within these programmes - the three-year BSc and the four-year MSci.</p>
<h4>BSc Degrees</h4>
<p>The BSc degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This is a joint degree which combines these two subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>

<p><strong>1. The concurrent route</strong></p>
<p>The four-year Bachelor of Education (BEd) Honours degree offered by the University Colleges (St Mary's or Stranmillis) is a professional degree programme&nbsp;for those intending to teach in Nursery, Primary or Post-Primary schools. Professional preparation is concurrent with the study of academic subjects.</p>
<p><strong>2. The consecutive route</strong></p>
<p>You will come to the University and take a degree other than Education, applying on graduation to the one-year postgraduate teacher training course (PGCE) in the University's School of Education. St Mary's and Stranmillis offer specialist PGCE programmes in Irish-Medium education and Early Years Education respectively. Either way, you will be a graduate of Queen's and a qualified teacher. The University and the University Colleges are required by the Government to adhere to strict quotas for admission to each type of course as a means of matching the output of teachers to the number of vacant posts. However with the concurrent route you will still be qualified to teach in any type of school.</p>
<p>If you want to be a Primary or a Post-Primary teacher and decide on the concurrent route, you can apply through UCAS to follow the BEd degree in Stranmillis University College. Applications for the BEd degree in St Mary’s University College must be made directly to the College, thereby providing additional application options outside UCAS. Information on how to apply is available on the Colleges’ websites.</p></td>

It is a discipline which also has important applications in industry and commerce, and well-qualified mathematicians and statisticians are in great demand, with a wide choice of careers, making Mathematics an excellent choice as a degree subject.

<ul>

<li>Statistics and Operational Research (SOR)</li>
</ul>
<p>In each, the ideas that have been encountered at school are extended and new areas are introduced.

For this reason, amongst others, Mathematics students usually study both Pure and Applied Mathematics in the first year, with Statistics being a likely third component.</p>
<p>Queen's offers several different degree programmes involving Mathematics, and there are two types of degree available within these programmes - the three-year BSc and the four-year MSci.</p>
<h4>BSc Degrees</h4>
<p>The BSc degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This is a joint degree which combines these two subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>

It is a discipline which also has important applications in industry and commerce, and well-qualified mathematicians and statisticians are in great demand, with a wide choice of careers, making Mathematics an excellent choice as a degree subject.

<li>Statistics and Operational Research (SOR)</li>

<p>Queen's offers several different degree programmes involving Mathematics, and there are two types of degree available within these programmes - the three-year BSc and the four-year MSci.</p>
<h4>BSc Degrees</h4>
<p>The BSc degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This is a joint degree which combines these two subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>

	<td class="hidden"><p>Mechanical Engineering is most often associated with large machines such as motorcycles, Formula 1 cars or aircraft, but virtually all man-made products have mechanical features that are designed and developed by mechanical engineers.</p>
<p>It is the broadest of the engineering professions as it is not linked to a specific industry, and its graduates have some of the most challenging, rewarding and diverse career opportunities of any discipline. These range from designing the latest road vehicles and developing new sustainable forms of materials, through to the search for alternative energy sources and the exploitation of nanotechnology.</p></td>

	<td class="hidden"><p>Planning is about changing the places within which we live. How we can transform and improve our cities, towns, villages, neighbourhoods and communities. It affects our everyday lives and is an extremely exciting discipline to study at university. A planning degree provides you with the knowledge and skills to be able to make decisions that shape the processes of growth and development. We currently face many major challenges - attracting investment, creating jobs, protecting the environment, energy policy, housing supply, transport links, providing local amenities - and planning affects how these things happen. Therefore, as future planners you will have a very important role to play in shaping the future. Planning is a broad subject matter and planners perform many different roles relating to the natural, physical, economic, social and cultural environments that we live in. Given this, planning offers a wide spectrum of employment opportunities. Studying planning will equip you with the knowledge to understand how cities, towns, villages, communities and neighbourhoods function and operate, and then have the skills to make decisions that shape how they grow and prosper.<br><br><br></p></td>

<p>As an applied social science, Social Policy provides a useful and relevant bridge between politics, sociology and economics and it draws on insights from these disciplines to analyse current policy and consider how we can achieve improvements.</p>
<p>Social Policy asks questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much responsibility falls to the individual or to society and the state when an individual is homeless, unemployed, poor or ill?<br><br></li>
<li>Should the welfare state offer care and protection to everyone 'from the cradle to the grave' or should society help those who help themselves?<br><br></li>
<li>Do people have a right to a basic income, a home, a job and education, or are obligations and duties more important than rights?</li>
</ul>
<p>Against a backdrop of social and economic upheaval it is more important than ever to understand the effects of government policies on individuals, families and communities, and the practical, political and ideological reasons underlying the formation of specific social policies.</p>
<p>Our degrees concentrate overall on policy in the UK and Ireland, but also take a comparative perspective that explores, where appropriate, how other nations provide public services.<br><br></p></td>

<p>One way of understanding social trends is to count people, activities and events, and societies are now awash with data on every aspect of people's lives. Sociologists need to become specialists in making sense of this data.</p>
<p>Queen's is one of only fifteen universities across the UK that have been funded* as part of Q-Step initiative to promote a step-change in undergraduate quantitative social science training. The initiative trains students to analyse social data through the delivery of specialist undergraduate programmes, including new courses, work placements and pathways to postgraduate study.</p>
<p>The BSc in Sociology with Quantitative Methods degree combines the curiosity of social inquiry with the quantitative skills required to collect and analyse social data. The degree is a key component of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/StudyatQueens/CourseFinder/UG/%22http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/QStep%22" target="&quot;_blank&quot;">Queen's Q-Step Centre</a> as it helps to address the critical shortage of quantitatively-skilled social science graduates. The need for such graduates is evidenced in the British Academy's position paper '<em>Society Counts</em>' which argues that "<em>Well-rounded graduates, equipped with core quantitative skills, are vital if the UK is to retain its status as a world leader in research and higher education, rebuild its economy, and provide citizens with the means to understand, analyse and criticise data</em>”.</p>

<p>Queen's offers several different degree programmes involving Mathematics, and there are two types of degree available within these programmes - the three-year BSc and the four-year MSci.</p>
<h4>BSc Degrees</h4>
<p>The BSc degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree offers the greatest flexibility and choice among the three subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This is a joint degree which combines these two subject areas.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree contains more emphasis on Statistics and Operational Research.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Extended Studies in Europe</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">This degree is designed for students with an interest in French or Spanish. After two years at Queen's, students spend one year abroad studying Mathematics in their chosen language before returning to Queen's for their final year.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Mathematics with Finance</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">Compared with other Mathematics degrees that allow a wide choice of modules, this degree is much more focused and provides students with a particular set of mathematical skills that are ideal for work in the financial services technology sector, as well as in software engineering.</p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;=""><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics / Theoretical Physics</strong></p>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These degrees are especially suitable for those wishing to study both Mathematics and Physics. The former is focused on the mathematical aspects of Physics, while the latter is a joint degree with a wider choice of modules.</p>
<h4>MSci Degrees</h4>
<p>The MSci degrees are available in the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Mathematics and Physics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mathematics and Statistics &amp; Operational Research</strong></li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Physics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="&quot;padding-left:" 30px;&quot;="">These four-year undergraduate degrees can be seen as extended versions of the three-year BSc Honours degrees, and are aimed primarily at students who intend to make significant use of their subject in their future careers, or who simply wish to broaden their understanding of Mathematics.</p>
<p>Note: students may register for either the three-year BSc or the four-year MSci degree. Transfers to the MSci are permitted up to the end of Stage 2, subject to performance. Progress to Stages 3 and 4 of the MSci is dependent on the student maintaining an approved high standard at earlier stages.</p></td>
